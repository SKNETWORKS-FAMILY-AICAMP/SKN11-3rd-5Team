{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Separation Anxiety in Dogs에 대해 자세히 알려줘."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Obviously, all we ever want to do is stay home cuddling our perfect pups. But sometimes, life gets in the way, and we have to leave our pets behind for pesky things like work, grocery runs, or (cover your dog’s eyes) canine-free travel. And as hard as it is for us to leave those puppy eyes at the door, it can be even harder for our pets — particularly those who suffer from separation anxiety.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nFirst things first: What is separation anxiety in dogs?\nIn a nutshell,separation anxietyoccurs when a dog experiences fear or panic when they’re left alone. Sometimes, it’s triggered by a specific person leaving the house; other times, it happens when anyone leaves. Common signs of separation anxietyinclude barking, panting, drooling,destroying furniture, peeing or poopingin the house, pacing, or an inability to settle down.\nKeep in mind that separation anxiety isn’t your dog’s fault. They have become separated from their support and social group, which can cause significant stress and even fear(for humans as well).Their actions aren’t a way to get back at you; instead, they are normal responses to stress and anxiety. Rather than blaming your dog, try to remain patient and understanding when helping them manage it.\nLike most things in 2023, there’s a Zoom link for this.\nWhat are the causes of separation anxiety in dogs?\nIt’s hard to know the exact causes of separation anxiety in dogs, but it usually has to do with major life changes. For example, a change in family (if your pup was rescued or adopted) or a change in their environment (if you moved from one house to another orwent back to work).\nAnother stressor could be the sudden absence of a pet parent, whether from a divorce or a death in the family. Loneliness, boredom, and old age can also cause separation anxiety in dogs. Don’t forget past experiences can weigh in as well. If they were abandoned, for example, their new human leaving may dredge up negative memories.\nSymptoms of separation anxiety\nEvery dog is going to respond to stress differently (sounds pretty familiar, right?). Some will start showing these signs while you’re getting ready because they know what’s coming. Others may only start to get upset after you’ve left, which may mean you have towatch them howl or cryon the pet or nanny cam. Some of the signs can include:\nLethargy or withdrawal\nLethargy or withdrawal\nNot eating\nNot eating\nClinginess\nClinginess\nPanting, pacing, or drooling\nPanting, pacing, or drooling\nTrembling, shivering\nTrembling, shivering\nHowling, barking, whining\nHowling, barking, whining\nChewing, scratching, or destroying items in your home\nChewing, scratching, or destroying items in your home\nSelf-destruction\nSelf-destruction\nUrinating or defecating in the house\nUrinating or defecating in the house\nWhat are the different types of separation anxiety in dogs?\nThere aren’t specific types of separation anxiety in dogs, butresearch showsthat there are four underlying frustrations that could be causing your dog’s anxiety. The four main forms of distress are: wanting to get to something outside, wanting to get away from something in the house, reacting to outside events or noises, andsevere boredom. The researchers note that getting to the root of the problem can help you treat your dog more effectively.\nNow this is stressingmeout. How do I help my dog?\nThe best-case scenario, at least if you ask your dog, is for you to literally never leave the house without them again. (But they might say that even if they don’t have separation anxiety.) The next best thing is to try to address symptoms of separation anxiety while you’re able to spend time at home.\nStart by paying attention to how your dog acts when you’re getting ready to leave the house. Look for signs that include pacing, panting,pulling their ears back, following you around, hiding, and — the ultimate sign that something is wrong — refusing treats. Also, check to see if your dog seems panicked when you close a door between you and them or leave the house briefly to take out the garbage. These are all signs of distress.\nIf you can’t tell if your dog is acting fearful or anxious, a little spying can come in handy. Try leaving your pup home for very short periods while watching themthrough a webcamto see how they react while you’re out. Not only can you get a good look at their behavior, but you may also be able to tell if there are any other triggers (loud noises, Amazon drivers dropping off yetanotherpackage at the door) contributing to the problem.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nWhat can I do to relieve anxiety (mine and my dog’s)?\nSeparation anxiety is tough — for both of you. Your dog is upset, and you’re upset that your dog is upset. It’s all very upsetting. Luckily, there are a few steps you can take totrain your pupto be more comfortable with being left alone.\nDogs are big fans of routines. Routines help them understand what you expect of them and what they can expect from their day. Set a morning schedule for activities such as feeding, potty breaks, and playtime or walks. This allows your dog to predict when they’ll receive your attention and when they’re on their own. They still might not want you to leave the house, but at least they won’t be blindsided when they see you reach for the car keys.\nEveryone loves a cozy nap spot, and dogs are no exception. Create a comfortable, safe place where your dog can chill. Maybe it’sa crate. Maybe it’s a back room of the house. Or — let’s be honest — it might be smack dab in the middle of your bed.\nStart training your dog to go to their happy place whenever it’s time to settle down. You can even turn on some music or leave a piece of clothing with your scent on it to help your dog feel at ease. The goal is for your dog to create a positive association with this spot and get used to being there by themselves, even when you’re in the house. Then, when you start to leave, they know they have a place they can go to feel safe and relaxed.\nOne word of caution: Some dogs who experience severe separation anxiety can panic and attempt to break free from crates — and hurt themselves in the process. So, be sure your dog is comfortable wherever their safe space is, especially if that’s being confined, before leaving them alone.\nTry not to draw attention to the fact that you’re getting ready to leave. If you can, have your dog settle in their happy place while you finish getting ready. Avoid dramatic goodbyes (even though you probably need a hug yourself before heading to work). When it’s time to go, give your dog a long-lasting treat (frozenpeanut butter-stuffed Kongswork great) or a toy that will keep them occupied long after you leave the house.\nIt’s 2023, and the office is calling. How can our dogs cope?\nHow to manage separation anxiety\nIf your dog still isn’t into a little alone time, there may be more options. Keep in mind that if your dog is truly miserable being home alone for more than just a few hours,doggie daycarecould be a godsend. There, your pup can socialize with people and other pets while getting in their daily exercise to boot. Win-win.\nDesensitizationtraining is a popular method for dogs with fears or phobias. It works by exposing your pup to small doses of what they don’t like, giving them praise and encouragement to show them it’s okay, and rewarding them when they respond appropriately. Exposure is gradually increased until they feel comfortable.\nWhen dealing with separation anxiety, this typically means giving your dog short periods of being alone and rewarding them when they’re calm and collected. This often starts with leaving them alone in a room for a few minutes and then petting them when you return. You can increase these times with short trips outside and then longer trips where you actually leave, showing them that no matter howlong you leave for, you’ll always come back.\nUse this one separately or as part of desensitization. It’s a veryflexible training methodthat simply includes rewarding your dog’s good behavior and ignoring or redirecting the bad. So, when a dog stays calm while you get ready to leave, reward them. If they start to whine or pace, redirect them to their safe place or give them a toy or treat to occupy them and then reward them.\nSome dogs are just more anxious than others. and even the best training won’t help them stay calm. In these cases, you may need a little herbal support. There are manynatural calming aidsin many different forms on the market, so be sure to talk to your vet about the ones they deem safe and effective.\nThen there are some dogs whose anxiety doesn’t respond to natural remedies either, so prescription medications may be necessary. Keep in mind: Good medications aren’t sedatives that make your dog seem calm because they feel tired; they help decrease anxiety at the brain level so your dog truly feels better about your departure.\nHow to treat and prevent confinement anxiety.\nHow do I prevent separation anxiety from developing in the first place?\nThe best way to prevent separation anxiety is to train them from a young age, during puppyhood, but here are some other preventative tips for separation anxiety in dogs:\nMake sure your pup has everything they need — physically, socially, and emotionally — so they don’t freak out when you leave the house.\nWhen you’re home with your pup, don’t fuss over them too much. Give them some space. Constant attention will make it harder for your pup when you leave.\nOffer your dog a toy, such asa food puzzle, to work on while you’re gone. It will keep them occupied and lessen their fear of being left alone.\nIt might sound silly, but playing some chill tunes, like classical music, may help keep your dog calm when you’re gone all day.\nWhen do I need to bring in the pros?\nThe sooner, the better. While it may seem like a trainer is the best person to reach out to first, your veterinarian may be the better option. They will be able to diagnose or rule out medical causes for the behavior first.\nWhile your veterinarian can treat any underlying medical issues, acertified traineror behaviorist can help come up with a plan to teach your dog that being alone doesn’t have to be scary. The recommendations will vary depending on your pet, but if you do use a trainer, be sure to do some research upfront.\nDisclaimer alert: This article is here to share information. But, much like pineapple on pizza, the topic may be controversial, meaning that not all vets or pet professionals agree. Every pet has specific needs. So, don’t take this as fact or medical advice. Talk things over with your vet when making decisions, and use your best judgment (about both your pet’s health and pizza toppings).\nWell-trained dogs have more freedom (and more fun).\nBottom line\nSeparation anxiety is no fun for either you or your dog. Not only does it make it more difficult for you to escape the house, but it can also be detrimental to your dog’s health and your property. Fortunately, there are many methods that can help put your dog more at ease with being alone, and if all else fails, don’t be afraid to reach out to your veterinarian.\nWe asked both animal behaviorists and human psychologists howyoucan deal with leaving your dog home alone.\nFAQs\nIt depends. Every dog and every situation is different, so it's hard to say how long it will take to see improvement in your dog's separation anxiety.\nSome home remedies for separation anxiety include playing your dog soothing music while you're gone or using a plug-in diffuser,such as Adaptil.\nThough any dog of any breed can develop separation anxiety, Border Collies, Labs, Jack Russell Terriers, and German Shepherds are a few that do so more frequently. This is because they tend to develop strong bonds with their pet parents and require a lot of physical and mental stimulation.\nThere’s no one answer for this – instead, it’s a combination of genetics, past experiences, temperament, and environmental changes that contribute to separation anxiety. It’s typically triggered by a sudden change in routine or environment that throws off their schedule.\nReferences\n“Positive Reinforcement Training.”The Humane Society of the United States.https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/positive-reinforcement-training.\n“Positive Reinforcement Training.”The Humane Society of the United States.https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/positive-reinforcement-training.\n“Reducing Fear and Stress with Desensitization and Counterconditioning.”VCA Animal Hospitals.https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/overcoming-fears-with-desensitization-and-counterconditioning.\n“Reducing Fear and Stress with Desensitization and Counterconditioning.”VCA Animal Hospitals.https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/overcoming-fears-with-desensitization-and-counterconditioning."}]}

While occasional floor-licking is generally harmless, excessive or persistent licking may indicate an underlying issue that requires further investigation.\nThe sentiment is nice, but...\nWhy is my dog licking the floor?\nDog parents often wonder if there’s an official medical term for some of the weird stuff their dogs do. Usually, there’s not. But there is a commonly used term for when a dog is constantly licking the floor — excessive licking of surfaces, or ELS. Pretty fitting.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nDogs with ELS will lick objects or surfaces for an unusual amount of time or frequency, or with unreasonable enthusiasm. ELS, by itself, is not a disease but a behavior that is often a consequence of an underlying issue.\nHere are some possible reasons your dog may be obsessively licking the floor:\nDogs use their keensense of smellto seek out food, especially at home. They know which of their people are messy eaters and where the crumbs are likely to be. Dogs may lick the floor in search of the tiniest morsels of food, leaving nothing behind. They can also sense if that sauce that was spilled on the floor wasn’t cleaned up as well as you think. Speaking of cleaning, considerpet-safe cleanerswhen wiping up spills.\nNausea will make some dogs lick a lot; they’ll lick their lips, the air, and odd surfaces. Some dogs may lick the floor excessively to try to calm their queasiness. Nausea can stem from many causes including dietary changes, dietary indiscretion, metabolic disease, or toxin ingestion.\nDogs with underlying gastrointestinal disease may also lick the floor excessively. Diseases of the gut can cause nausea and discomfort that trigger this behavior. Astudy conductedat the University of Montreal's Veterinary Teaching Hospital looked at 19 dogs with ELS (Excessive Licking Syndrome). The study found that 17 of the dogs had an underlying gastrointestinal disease. These diseases included inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis,Giardiainfections, and infiltrative diseases where abnormal cells infiltrated the lining of intestinal walls. The study also revealed that many of the dogs’ compulsive licking improved after their underlying disease was treated.\nDogs experiencing oral pain may drool and lick excessively. The pain can occur fromperiodontal disease, tumors, ulcers, or foreign objects stuck in the mouth. If a dog won’t stop licking the floor and is coughing, they may have irritation in their throat or esophagus.\nBehavioral changes in dogs can stem from seizure activity, brain tumors, or inflammatory diseases affecting the central nervous system. Dogs with partial or focal seizures may display odd repetitive behaviors like biting the air or licking the floor. These behaviors will continue despite calling to get their attention.\nSenior dogs can developcognitive dysfunction syndrome, which is similar to dementia in people. These aging dogs can display abnormal behaviors like wandering, staring off, house-soiling, and excessive licking.\nCompulsive disorders in dogs lead to behaviors that are exaggerated, inappropriately repetitive, and out of context. These behaviors can include licking surfaces, chasing shadows, chasing their tail, pacing, and over-grooming to the point ofself-trauma. Initially, dogs may display these behaviors out of fear, anxiety, excitement, or attention-seeking, but with time, they get out of control.\nDogs may also repeatedly lick the floor to alleviate stress and boredom. Licking can be triggered by stressful situations like environmental changes, new people, thunderstorms,or fireworks. The act of licking releases endorphins, “feel-good” hormones that can help ease times of stress.\nSometimes, dogs will constantly lick the floor out of lack of something better to do. Dogs that lick out of boredom should be provided with mental stimulation and physical activity before licking progresses to more destruction chewing, scratching, and digging.\nCertain conditions can make dogs experience polyphagia, which is a term for excessive hunger. These conditions include diabetes mellitus, Cushing’s disease, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), and hypethyroid disease (rare in dogs). Steroids, like prednisone, can also cause excessive hunger. When there’s no food in sight, dogs with polyphagia may resort to licking the floor in search of a snack.\nTheir toes might smell like Fritos, but there’s no way they tastethatgood.\nWhen to consult a veterinarian\nIt's normal and not a big deal if a dog licks the floor occasionally. But when the behavior becomes excessive, it should be checked out. If you’re concerned your dog is showing signs of ELS, talk to your vet. Your dog should definitely be examined if you notice these signs:\nLicking that interferes with normal activity\nLicking that interferes with normal activity\nLicking that continues despite trying to get a dog’s attention\nLicking that continues despite trying to get a dog’s attention\nOther compulsive behaviors like tail-chasing and over-grooming\nOther compulsive behaviors like tail-chasing and over-grooming\nFoul odors from the mouth\nFoul odors from the mouth\nPain\nPain\nVomiting or diarrhea\nVomiting or diarrhea\nPoor appetite\nPoor appetite\nExcessive thirst and urination\nExcessive thirst and urination\nYour vet will likely want to rule out medical causes before deeming constant floor licking as a strictly behavioral issue. A medical history and physical exam help determine the next steps. If there is concern for a gastrointestinal or metabolic issue, then bloodwork, urinalysis, fecal exam, and imaging (radiographs or ultrasound) may be recommended.\nIf there is concern for an underlying neurological condition, referral to a veterinary neurologist may be necessary for an MRI and spinal fluid sampling. If medical issues are ruled out, then the focus can shift to environmental and behavioral modification techniques.\nAnd when you want to draw the line attoomany kisses.\nPreventing excessive floor-licking\nExcessive floor-licking in dogs can’t always be prevented, but ensuring that your dog’s needs are being met can help reduce the risk of conditions that trigger excessive licking.\nStay current on preventative care.\nStay current on preventative care.\nProvide regular dental care (including teeth brushing at home and professional cleanings).\nProvide regular dental care (including teeth brushing at home and professional cleanings).\nFeed your dog a balanced, high-quality diet.\nFeed your dog a balanced, high-quality diet.\nAvoid going overboard with treats and snacks.\nAvoid going overboard with treats and snacks.\nProvide plenty of physical exercise and mentation stimulation.\nProvide plenty of physical exercise and mentation stimulation.\nMinimize stress.\nMinimize stress.\nAnd when will itstop?\nFAQs (People also ask):\nDogs can lick the floor for many reasons including gastrointestinal disease, oral pain, neurological disorders, stress, excessive hunger, and boredom.

Most often, she says, “I see it when dogs just have not been overly socialized, have not lived inside previously, or are just sensitive and fearful to a new environment.”\nSometimes, dogs’ anxiety might stem from thekindsof stairs you have in your home. Older houses, in particular, tend to have narrow or steep staircases, which can create stress or vision challenges. If the floor texture on your stairs differs from the rest of your home, that can factor in as well; some harder floors can leave dogs feeling unstable, which is less than ideal when they’re trying to climb.\nFloating stairs, which have gaps in between each step, can also scare dogs off, says Claren Mulhall, co-owner and head trainer atCloud K-9 Dog Training. From a dog’s angle, she points out, those sleek, modern steps will look like they’re full of holes. If your dog is cowering at the top or bottom, try throwing a blanket over them so that they appear solid.\n“Another consideration, and always my first consideration if I work with a dog who is afraid of stairs, is to rule out any medical causes,” Mulhall says. “A dog with knee or hip issues may be very uncomfortable or find it painful to use stairs, so they avoid them as much as possible.”\nIf your dog seems vehemently opposed to stairs, it’s worth checking with their veterinarian to make sure that their resistance is not a sign of bigger issues. The last thing you want is to make the condition worse by forcing them to push through it.\nHow can we help adult dogs who are afraid of stairs overcome their fears?\nJust like most people wouldn’t love to learn how to swim by being thrown into a freezing cold swimming pool, it’s important to be gradual and deliberate when training your dog to deal with stairs. Both Lawless and Mulhall emphasize the importance of starting small. (Think: starting with just one stair.) For many dogs, Mulhall adds, it might be easier to try going down the stairs first, rather than up.\n“Sit on the stairs with some yummy treats and encourage the dog to put a single paw on the step, then treat, then two paws and treat, etc.,” Mulhall says. “Don’t pull the dog up or down the stairs. Reward them with treats along the way.”\nLawless recommends throwing a treat away from the stairs after completing that same process. That little extra step can turn the exercise into a fun cat-and-mouse game while also creating an opportunity to seek consent from your dog to continue the training.\n“If you go back towards the first step and the dog doesn’t follow you, that’s a sign, to me, that the dog was a little overwhelmed, versus a dog who is like, ‘Oh, I’ll jump back on those stairs for another cookie,’” Lawless says.\nIf you don’t have stairs in your home but want to teach your dog how to handle them in other environments, you can use obstacles like blocks, large books, exercise platforms, and even your legs to get them used to the movement of picking up all their legs. Claren says that wherever you’re training, the most important thing you can do is to make sure that whatever your dog does at the end of the stairs is going to be a good time — a play session or some treats, perhaps. In other words, save theveterinarian’s front stepsfor another time.\nItispowerful enough, even for the tough cases, and itisthe best choice—here’s why.\nHow can we help puppies become comfortable around stairs?\nPuppies tend to be better at adjusting to new people, places, and things than older dogs, so if you have the chance to introduce your puppy to stairs, be sure to take advantage. If your puppy is still working on coordination and balance, Lawless recommends covering the stairs with something like a bath mat, a yoga mat, or even a roll of stair carpeting. This will ensure they don’t lose their footing. As always,treats will be your best friend.\nFrom there, Lawless recommends gently guiding your puppy up the first step or two, allowing them to take their time getting familiar with the surface. Don’t worry about the rest of the staircase just yet — wait until your puppy seems confident navigating that first step. And just like with adult dogs, let their interest be your guide. If your puppy seems reluctant to get back on, that’s probably a sign that it’s time to hit pause.\n“What we don’t want to do is force them up or down,” Lawless says. “We can definitely [overwhelm] them and then make them more fearful of the stairs. So it’s really important to not rush it.”\nToo often, Mulhall agrees, pet parents can try too much too soon. Her suggestion? “Work with what your dog can handle. Don’t try practicing with stairs when you’re in a hurry.” With young puppies especially, be mindful of theirphysical developmentto avoid overdoing things.\nDid you get a dog for emotional support and now they are the one who needs it?\nHow can I tell if training is overwhelming my dog?\nIt’s helpful to get to know all of the usual body language dogs use to convey stress, like stiff posture, darting eyes, andexcessive lip-licking. That said, there are a few specific behaviors that you might want to watch for while working with stairs.\nFirst, watch how your dog distributes their weight at the foot of the stairs. If they’re taking a step up but keep their back legs weighed to avoid putting too much weight on the step, it means that they’re not comfortable enough yet to ascend to the next step.\nStress panting is another sign to watch for. “Especially if they pant and look away from the stairs or look up at you, it means that they’re probably struggling with making that next step in a confident way,” Lawless says. “At that point, I would probably practice just teaching them to go up and down that first one or two sets of stairs with lots of treats, and doing that in very short sessions.”\nIf your home has stairs, Lawless recommends carrying your puppy up and down as needed, while they’re still in training. Don’t force your puppy to “sink or swim” by taking them all at once. The same goes for adult dogs. Avoid getting impatient and instead, focus on positively reinforcing the progress they’re making while taking things slow. If you have an extra-large dog who can’t be alone, consider sleeping downstairs with them overnight for a while as they build their skills.\n“This is a lifelong commitment,” Lawless says, “and it’s best to set yourself up for long-term success, versus forcing an issue — because that might end up putting you backwards.”\nOffering fewer treats can actually be agoodthing.\nWhen is it time to seek professional help?\nIt may be helpful to involve expert from the beginning. In addition to checking with your vet to rule out medical problems, Mulhall recommends seeking out acertified Fear Free trainerto help navigate the training process. Lawless, meanwhile, notes that for those who live on higher floors in apartment buildings with stairs, a professional can expedite the training progress and help your dog make faster progress than you might achieve on your own.\nWherever you are in your training journey, never fear. This kind of work takes time, and at times, it might feel like an uphill battle. But as the great Miley Cyrus once  said, it ain’t about how fast [your dog] gets there, ain’t about what’s waiting on the other side — it’s the climb."}]}

Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nUnderstandingwhyour dogs feel the urge to shower us with slobbery kisses is the first step in navigating their displays of affection. Why do pups want tolick us all the time? ​​And what is the relationship between a dog’s kisses and our own health? Delve into the reasons behind a dog’s desire to lick your face; whether their saliva is as clean as they’d like us to think; and whether allowing your dog to lick your face, lips, or mouth is best practice.\nThe sentiment is nice, but...\nWhy does my puppy lick my face? (And should they?)\nTypically, dog behaviors serve as aform of communication, and licking is no different. Licking may occur when your dog is excited, or showing affection, but it can also happen whenyour dog feels nervous. Your dog may lick to explore their environment or try something they think smells tasty. You may catch your dog licking the kitchen floor or the cement outside the ice cream shop.\nDid you just finish a meal and your dog wants to lick your lips? They are probably trying to get a taste of that yummy meal you just had. Another reason a dog may lick is to show affection or grooming behavior, similar to how they show affection to the mother dog.\nSometimes, when a dog licks, it can be an appeasement or nervous behavior. Have you evergiven your dog a big hug, and they seemed hesitant and licked you, looking at you out of the corner of their eyes? (This is, of course called“side-eye”: When your dog looks at you and their pupils move to the side of their eye causing you to see the whites of their eyes, sometimes called whale eye.) Your dog is telling you that they accept that affection, because they trust you but do not truly enjoy what you are doing to them, they are telling you they are uncomfortable.\nLicking can also be a sign of affection. Who doesn’t love returning home for the day and your dog greets you at the top of the stairs wiggling their entire body, then they plant a lick or two on your face? It is all fun and games until you remember where you saw them putting their tongue earlier that day. Then you may think twice about letting them lick you…\nBoundaries, folks. Boundaries.\nShould I let my dog lick me on the mouth?\nThe decision to let your dog kiss you on the mouth ultimately comes down to personal preference and risk tolerance. For most healthy individuals, the risk of contracting an illness from a dog’s saliva is relatively low. However, if you fall into the more susceptible categories or have concerns about potential bacterial transmission, it’s advisable to err on the side of caution.\nPet parents should consider factors such as their dog’s diet, overall health and an individual’s susceptibility to infections. It’s crucial to strike a balance between fostering a strong bond with your dog and ensuring responsible pet parenting. If you choose to allow your dog to lick your face, establishing boundaries and practicing good hygiene can mitigate potential risks.\nHere are some considerations to help you make an informed decision:\nHealth status: If you or someone in your household has a compromised immune system, it’s best to limit direct contact with your dog’s saliva, especially around the mouth.\nHealth status: If you or someone in your household has a compromised immune system, it’s best to limit direct contact with your dog’s saliva, especially around the mouth.\nDietary habits: Dogs on a raw diet may carry additional bacteria, so be mindful of their diet and take appropriate precautions.\nDietary habits: Dogs on a raw diet may carry additional bacteria, so be mindful of their diet and take appropriate precautions.\nPersonal comfort: If the idea of your dog’s kisses on your mouth doesn’t sit well with you, there’s no harm in setting boundaries.

You may have also seendogs eat their own poop, other animal poop, old rotten food, dead carcasses, and more. Even though a dog’s mouth contains certain antibacterial enzymes that can help heal wounds it does not mean that their mouths’ are clean.\nThere is always a chance of contracting a pathogen from your dog’s saliva. Many pathogens your dog may have can not be transmitted from pup to human, but some can be passed on to you.\nIf a dog is eating a raw diet, there is a greater risk of you contracting a sickness. If your dog eats raw meat, you could contract Salmonella orE. coli. When preparing raw meals for your dog, it is always good to take extra precautions when preparing their meals. Be sure to clean the area where you prepared the food, as well as clean their bowls after each use and the area where they eat their meals. It may also be best to wait a few hours before allowing your dog to lick you after they have consumed raw meat.\nAnother reason you should not allow your dog to lick you is when you have an open wound. Allowing your dog to lick your open wound can make you sick or in extreme cases septic.  The bacteriaCapnocytophagacan live inside your dog’s mouth. This bacteria does not make your pet ill but can make you sick. Most people who have come in contact withCapnocytophagawill not get sick, yet there is a chance of getting sick from this bacteria if you have a compromised immune system.\nIf you have a compromised immune system, it is best to proceed with caution when allowing a dog to lick your face, or anywhere on your body for that matter. If a dog has licked you, and it was unavoidable (they are just so darn cute) it is always good to wash the area a dog has come in contact with, especially if you are at a greater risk of illness.\nThen, there’s the issue of dog allergies. Not only can people beallergic to pet dander, but some people are allergic to dog saliva. If you are allergic, allowing a dog to lick you may cause an allergic reaction. You may get a rash, swelling, or become itchy. This happens because certain proteins from dog saliva may cause your immune system to react and attack those proteins as if it were a virus.\nWhile keeping your dog or cat at home where they belong.\nWhat should I do if my dog licks me on the mouth?\nIf your dog surprises you with an unexpected kiss on the mouth, here are some practical guidelines to help minimize potential risks to you.\nWash your face: After any dog-human interaction involving licking, wash your face thoroughly with mild soap (or face wash) and water to reduce the likelihood of transferring any bacteria.\nWash your face: After any dog-human interaction involving licking, wash your face thoroughly with mild soap (or face wash) and water to reduce the likelihood of transferring any bacteria.\nMonitor for symptoms: Keep an eye out for any unusual symptoms, especially if you or someone in your household is more susceptible to infections.\nMonitor for symptoms: Keep an eye out for any unusual symptoms, especially if you or someone in your household is more susceptible to infections.\nEducate yourself: Stay informed about the potential risks associated with dog saliva, especially if your dog is on a raw diet.\nEducate yourself: Stay informed about the potential risks associated with dog saliva, especially if your dog is on a raw diet.\nSet boundaries: Establish clear boundaries with your pup to control licking behaviors. Consistent training can help reinforce these boundaries and create a healthy balance between affection and hygiene.\nSet boundaries: Establish clear boundaries with your pup to control licking behaviors. Consistent training can help reinforce these boundaries and create a healthy balance between affection and hygiene.\nIf they’re following you around like your shadow, there’s a reason for that.\nHow to train my dog to stop licking me\nIt is always best touse positive reinforcementwhen training a behavior. Using positive reinforcement when training your dog creates apositive association with the behavioryou are working on. When your dog has been reinforced positively, they are more likely to choose to do the behavior you are asking of them. When training your dog not to lick, it is important to be as neutral as possible, rather than getting angry or annoyed.\nAny reinforcement — even negative reinforcement — may cause your dog to continue the unwanted behavior of licking. Yelling “no” and telling someone to stop means they should stop the behavior. Dogs do not speak our language, and if they have not been taught the word stop or no, they may think you are pulling away and saying “no” as a game. They may begin to act more silly and playful, because they think you are riling them up. So, rather than engaging with a dog when they lick you, turn away from them.\nWhen turning away or ignoring them, you want to be neutral; this will help your dog stay positive and better understand what you are asking them to do. When turning away, go slowly, do not make any noises, and avoid eye contact. When a dog looks away from another dog it is signaling to the other dog they need a break or do not like what is happening. So, by avoiding eye contact, you are telling your dog you did not like that.\nBe sure to be consistent, it is very confusing to your dog if you allow them to lick you one day but not another. If you continue to look away or ignore your dog when they lick you, the behavior will decrease over time. If turning away from them does not work, you may have to move away or leave the room completely, when doing so remember to be as neutral as possible. Your goal is not to upset your dog, your goal is to teach your dog to understand your message: When you lick me, I leave.\nThe age-old debate of whether to let your dog kiss you on the mouth boils down to a combination of personal preference, health considerations and risk tolerance. While your dog’s affectionate kisses are heartwarming, being aware of potential health risks allows you to make informed choices that prioritize both your wellbeing and the bond you share with them.\nReferences:\nSalivary Proteomics of Healthy Dogs: An In-Depth Catalog\nSalivary Proteomics of Healthy Dogs: An In-Depth Catalog\nLick of Death: Capnocytophaga Canimorsus Is an Important Cause of Sepsis in the Elderly\nLick of Death: Capnocytophaga Canimorsus Is an Important Cause of Sepsis in the Elderly\nComparative Proteomic Study of Dog and Human Saliva\nComparative Proteomic Study of Dog and Human Saliva\nCapnocytophaga\nCapnocytophaga\nCan You Be Allergic to Dog Saliva?\nCan You Be Allergic to Dog Saliva?"}]}

If you find that your puppy loses interest quickly or becomes easily distracted, try shortening the session or taking a walk beforehand to burn off excess energy.\nWhy training an excited puppy is challenging\nBecause puppies are new to the world, their brains are still developing. They are always learning, exploring, and being exposed to new stimuli, which makes it hard to focus. With practice, exposure, and age, their attention spans will continue to grow.\nJust like toddlers, puppies have an excess amount of energy until they crash. They can go, go, go! Going for a walk, having a play session, or letting your puppy sniff where they choose is important to do before your training sessions, especially with an overly excited puppy. After all their hard work, it’s important to give your puppy naps. Just like a human child, puppies can get cranky, which can lead to biting behaviors or other unwanted behaviors. This is the perfect time to practice crate training when your puppy is tired and due for a nap.\nThey’re just so hyped.\nPreparing to train your puppy\nBecause puppies are distracted by everything and anything, you want to pick a quiet, distraction-free environment. Over time, you can add little interruptions to your practice to help your puppy generalize skills. If you are training in a new environment, allow your puppy some time to explore and sniff around the new space before beginning your training.\nMaking trainingfunfor your puppy is the best way to get the most out of your training experience. If it is fun for your puppy, they will be engaged and willing to participate. I like to joke with my dog-training clients that if you sound a little silly when praising your puppy, then you are doing it right!\nUse anexcited baby voiceto tell your puppy they did something correctly. Reward them with a toy or treat. Pairing your voice and treats or toys with training will be the key to eventually fading treats out of your sessions as your dog learns the skills.\nKeeping your training sessions short and sweet is the key to success. You want to end the session before your puppy gets over it. Always end on a high note. If your puppy does the best sit they’ve ever done, give them a couple of treats and let that be the end of the training session. Or if you notice your puppy slowing down, get them to sit one more time, and then take a break.\nStep-by-step guide: Teaching your puppy to sit\nWhen picking a treat to use in training, you want something that is small or easy to break apart, quick to chew, and smells great.\nUse your treat as a lure to help get your puppy into the right position. Bring the treat up to your puppy’s nose, get them interested in it, and bring the treat up and back over their head in a straight line, moving the treat towards their tail. Take your time and move slowly; you want them to stay interested in the treat as you move it back.\nTheir nose should be glued to the treat the first few times you lure them. This is what is going to get them into the correct sitting position. This lure will become your hand signal for the cue sit. Hand signals are a great tool to use when training dogs because they learn so much from observing body language.\nAs soon as their butt hits the ground reward them following this pattern: treat, voice, touch. You want your voice to be fun and exciting. When petting your puppy, make sure you pet them in a way that they enjoy.\nYou can ask your puppy to sit a few times, but then give them a break. You always want to end after a sit before they get distracted and lose interest. A puppy break can be agame of tug, a nap, a walk, or just leaving them to sniff.\nWhen training your dog, adding the cue is the last step. Once your dog is reliably following the lure and you know they can complete the behavior of sitting with 95 percent reliability, you can begin to add the cue. As they start to understand the cue, you can begin to fade the lure (the treat). Put the treat in your opposite hand, then bring the hand you have typically had the lure in up and back over your puppy’s head. When they sit, reward them with the treat.\nTroubleshooting common challenges\nSometimes, if a puppy is too excited, they may need to burn off extra energy. Try training your puppy after a walk or play session for better results. Be sure to take a look at the environment you are training in. Is it a quiet area that has minimal distractions?\nHas your puppy stopped responding? Do they seem like they are ignoring you?\nDo they need a nap? Is the training area too distracting? If these are not an issue, take a look at the treat you are using. You want to use a high-value treat and has an appealing smell to your puppy. Biscuits or their kibble are not great options for training. Liver, or low-sodium turkey dogs, are a few examples of good options.\nRemember to keep your training sessions short, fun, and engaging. If you notice your puppy losing steam, you are probably trying to keep their attention longer than they can handle. Try taking a break and cutting your training sessions to be half the length you are currently trying. Then you can work your way up.\nYou’re happy to see them, too. But you’d be even happier if they didn’t create a mess.\nTips for success: Building positive habits\nIt is important to stay consistent while training your puppy because they learn from repetition. The more reps your puppy practices in different locations with different levels of distraction, the more the behaviors will become solidified and reliable.\nPuppies’ short attention spans, curiosity, and excitement only allow them to stay on task for a limited time. Keeping training sessions short will allow for more success. Your sessions should be no longer than five to 10 minutes.\nAllow your puppy to blow off some steam before starting your training session. Take them for a walk where they have the freedom to sniff around before starting your session. This will help them be more engaged when it is time to train.\nPick your treats wisely! Do not use kibble or biscuits; they are too bland. Use a treat that is high in value and easy to chew.\nA few short training sessions a day will help you get on a path of success. As your puppy gets better with training, you can begin to increase the length of the sessions as well as the distractions.\nNot only is your puppy new to the world, but they are also new to training, which is not something that comes naturally to them. Staying patient during training will keep your training positive for your puppy, which will keep them excited and engaged.\nBottom line\nPuppies are so much fun to train. Staying patient, consistent, and engaging will help you get the most out of your training sessions. Be sure to keep your training sessions short, in a distraction-free environment to start. And always use high-value treats and positive reinforcement. Most of all, have fun!\nReferences\nBatt, Lara, et al. “The Effects of Structured Sessions for Juvenile Training and Socialization on Guide Dog Success and Puppy-Raiser Participation.”Journal of Veterinary Behavior, vol. 3, no. 5, Sept. 2008, pp. 199–206,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2008.05.001.\nBatt, Lara, et al. “The Effects of Structured Sessions for Juvenile Training and Socialization on Guide Dog Success and Puppy-Raiser Participation.”Journal of Veterinary Behavior, vol. 3, no. 5, Sept. 2008, pp. 199–206,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2008.05.001.\nBatt, Lara, et al. “Relationships between Puppy Management Practices and Reported Measures of Success in Guide Dog Training.”Journal of Veterinary Behavior, vol. 5, no. 5, Sept. 2010, pp. 240–246,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2010.02.004.\nBatt, Lara, et al. “Relationships between Puppy Management Practices and Reported Measures of Success in Guide Dog Training.”Journal of Veterinary Behavior, vol. 5, no. 5, Sept. 2010, pp. 240–246,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2010.02.004.\nMeunier, LaVonne D. “Selection, Acclimation, Training, and Preparation of Dogs for the Research Setting.”ILAR Journal, vol. 47, no. 4, 1 Jan. 2006, pp. 326–347,academic.oup.com/ilarjournal/article/47/4/326/808937,https://doi.org/10.1093/ilar.47.4.326.\nMeunier, LaVonne D. “Selection, Acclimation, Training, and Preparation of Dogs for the Research Setting.”ILAR Journal, vol. 47, no. 4, 1 Jan. 2006, pp. 326–347,academic.oup.com/ilarjournal/article/47/4/326/808937,https://doi.org/10.1093/ilar.47.4.326."}]}
