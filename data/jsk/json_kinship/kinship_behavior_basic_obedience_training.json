    "page_content": "Let’s be real — walking your dog isn’t just some boring chore. For most dogs, it’s basically their version of scrolling on TikTok, hitting the gym to burn off all those training treats, and their daily meet-up all in one. And it’s not just about those wins.Walks aresensory adventureswhere dogs get to use their sniffing superpower. Word on the street is that walks are essential for keeping your pup happy, healthy, and into you. It’s simple, right? Just walk your dog, and all will be well. Sadly, no. It turns out even this activity, almost universally acknowledged to be what dogs need and want, has plenty of myths associated with it. Keep reading for seven myths that need to be debunked.\nEvery dog needs a walk every day.\nSomewhere along the way, “Youmustwalk your dog every single day, or you’re a terrible person” became the norm. Honestly, anyone who says that needs to calm down. Yes,mostdogs adore their daily walks. But that doesn’t meaneverydog does. Some pups get stressed or afraid when (literally) stepping outside their comfort zone. The world is loud, chaotic, and overwhelming. You’re actually being kind to those dogs if you skip the daily walk.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nTheymight prefera game of fetch in the yard or sniffing around their usual safe spots. Also, newly adopted dogs are just adjusting to a whole new world. Throwing them into the street like, “Let’s go see the city!” on day one is like dragging jet-lagged travelers on an all-day tour. Let them settle in. Walks can wait a bit.\nDogs should always be walked on a leash.\nSure, if there are laws or safety risks that require it, absolutely use the leash. But if you’re somewhere that’s off-leash-friendly and your dog’s not a flight risk? Let them be free. Off-leash joy hits different. Running around, zig-zagging through trees, and sniffing everything is so much fun.\nDogswant to make choices, run at full speed, head here, there, and everywhere, and run back and forth between you and all the trees and grassy spots. But hey, if off-leash isn’t an option where you live, that’s OK. Dogs who walk on-leash have an awesome time out there, too.\nA tired dog is a happy dog.\nOK, this one’s sort of true, but not in the way most people think. It’s not about wearing them out like a toddler at a trampoline park. It’s about getting those happy brain chemicals flowing.\nExercise — especially running — releases endocannabinoids. These chill-out chemicals help reduce anxiety andboost mood, and they can evenlessen pain. That calm you see after a walk? That’s contentment, not exhaustion.\nYou have to keep dogs moving on walks to get the benefits.\nThis nonsense that you should “keep ’em moving” is so damaging for dogs. They want to experience the world, not go to a boring cardio class. For many dogs, it’s all about the chance to mosey, meander, and sniff to their heart’s content.\nIf you hurry them along every time they stop to sniff or to enjoy the sunlight on their face, you’re not making the walk better — you’re getting in the way of their enjoyment of it. What makes walks magical to most dogs is the smells and the chance to wander this way and that to explore what catches their attention. Walks should be more like “sniffaris” (aka little journeys on which they can smell the world), not forced marches.\nThey’re not tired if they are pulling on the leash.\nNope. Pulling isn’t about energy level. It’s more like, “OMG, I see (or smell) something!!” Excitement, habit, frustration — they all play a part. Even high-energy dogs can walk like angels if they’ve been taught how. Being energetic and having leash manners are not mutually exclusive, but dogs need to be taught to control their arousal and to behave as you want them to by keeping a loose leash.\nYes, high-energy dogs may be more likely to pull than less-energetic ones, but dogs of all sorts need to be trained to walk in a teamwork kind of way. Pro tip: If your dog is Team Waterskiing (you’ll know it when you see it) on walks, try anout-and-back routeinstead of a loop. A lot of dogs chill out on the way home because they are not so excited for the walk to end by returning home. Plus, thesmells aren’t as excitingthe second time around.\nOlder dogs don’t need walks.\nExcept they do. Just because your senior dog isn’t goingfull zoomiesmode when they don’t get a walk doesn’t mean they don’t miss it. Older dogs might not start barking, pacing, whining, and chewing on things if they miss a walk, but they still want to see the world, even if it’s just a slow stroll to the corner and back.\nLet dogs in theirgolden years live a little. Maybe it’s not a problemfor youwhen an older dog doesn’t get a walk because they don’t act in ways that make you suffer. It’s still a problemfor thembecause their quality of life and daily joy suffer.\nWalks always tire dogs out.\nHa! If only. You know how you sometimes take a walk to wake up your brain rather than have your third iced coffee of the day? Yeah, dogs are kind of like that, especially the rocket-fueled types who could run 10 miles before breakfast and then gleefully look at you like, “What’s next?”\nFor them, a walk isn’t exhausting — it’s energizing. If you’re trying to wear them out, they probably need a real workout:think fetchuntil your arm rebels, sprints at the park, or an epic playdate with their BFF. Otherwise, that walk? It’s just them getting warmed up to cause more chaos.",

If you find that your puppy loses interest quickly or becomes easily distracted, try shortening the session or taking a walk beforehand to burn off excess energy.\nWhy training an excited puppy is challenging\nBecause puppies are new to the world, their brains are still developing. They are always learning, exploring, and being exposed to new stimuli, which makes it hard to focus. With practice, exposure, and age, their attention spans will continue to grow.\nJust like toddlers, puppies have an excess amount of energy until they crash. They can go, go, go! Going for a walk, having a play session, or letting your puppy sniff where they choose is important to do before your training sessions, especially with an overly excited puppy. After all their hard work, it’s important to give your puppy naps. Just like a human child, puppies can get cranky, which can lead to biting behaviors or other unwanted behaviors. This is the perfect time to practice crate training when your puppy is tired and due for a nap.\nThey’re just so hyped.\nPreparing to train your puppy\nBecause puppies are distracted by everything and anything, you want to pick a quiet, distraction-free environment. Over time, you can add little interruptions to your practice to help your puppy generalize skills. If you are training in a new environment, allow your puppy some time to explore and sniff around the new space before beginning your training.\nMaking trainingfunfor your puppy is the best way to get the most out of your training experience. If it is fun for your puppy, they will be engaged and willing to participate. I like to joke with my dog-training clients that if you sound a little silly when praising your puppy, then you are doing it right!\nUse anexcited baby voiceto tell your puppy they did something correctly. Reward them with a toy or treat. Pairing your voice and treats or toys with training will be the key to eventually fading treats out of your sessions as your dog learns the skills.\nKeeping your training sessions short and sweet is the key to success. You want to end the session before your puppy gets over it. Always end on a high note. If your puppy does the best sit they’ve ever done, give them a couple of treats and let that be the end of the training session. Or if you notice your puppy slowing down, get them to sit one more time, and then take a break.\nStep-by-step guide: Teaching your puppy to sit\nWhen picking a treat to use in training, you want something that is small or easy to break apart, quick to chew, and smells great.\nUse your treat as a lure to help get your puppy into the right position. Bring the treat up to your puppy’s nose, get them interested in it, and bring the treat up and back over their head in a straight line, moving the treat towards their tail. Take your time and move slowly; you want them to stay interested in the treat as you move it back.\nTheir nose should be glued to the treat the first few times you lure them. This is what is going to get them into the correct sitting position. This lure will become your hand signal for the cue sit. Hand signals are a great tool to use when training dogs because they learn so much from observing body language.\nAs soon as their butt hits the ground reward them following this pattern: treat, voice, touch. You want your voice to be fun and exciting. When petting your puppy, make sure you pet them in a way that they enjoy.\nYou can ask your puppy to sit a few times, but then give them a break. You always want to end after a sit before they get distracted and lose interest. A puppy break can be agame of tug, a nap, a walk, or just leaving them to sniff.\nWhen training your dog, adding the cue is the last step. Once your dog is reliably following the lure and you know they can complete the behavior of sitting with 95 percent reliability, you can begin to add the cue. As they start to understand the cue, you can begin to fade the lure (the treat). Put the treat in your opposite hand, then bring the hand you have typically had the lure in up and back over your puppy’s head. When they sit, reward them with the treat.\nTroubleshooting common challenges\nSometimes, if a puppy is too excited, they may need to burn off extra energy. Try training your puppy after a walk or play session for better results. Be sure to take a look at the environment you are training in. Is it a quiet area that has minimal distractions?\nHas your puppy stopped responding? Do they seem like they are ignoring you?\nDo they need a nap? Is the training area too distracting? If these are not an issue, take a look at the treat you are using. You want to use a high-value treat and has an appealing smell to your puppy. Biscuits or their kibble are not great options for training. Liver, or low-sodium turkey dogs, are a few examples of good options.\nRemember to keep your training sessions short, fun, and engaging. If you notice your puppy losing steam, you are probably trying to keep their attention longer than they can handle. Try taking a break and cutting your training sessions to be half the length you are currently trying. Then you can work your way up.\nYou’re happy to see them, too. But you’d be even happier if they didn’t create a mess.\nTips for success: Building positive habits\nIt is important to stay consistent while training your puppy because they learn from repetition. The more reps your puppy practices in different locations with different levels of distraction, the more the behaviors will become solidified and reliable.\nPuppies’ short attention spans, curiosity, and excitement only allow them to stay on task for a limited time. Keeping training sessions short will allow for more success. Your sessions should be no longer than five to 10 minutes.\nAllow your puppy to blow off some steam before starting your training session. Take them for a walk where they have the freedom to sniff around before starting your session. This will help them be more engaged when it is time to train.\nPick your treats wisely! Do not use kibble or biscuits; they are too bland. Use a treat that is high in value and easy to chew.\nA few short training sessions a day will help you get on a path of success. As your puppy gets better with training, you can begin to increase the length of the sessions as well as the distractions.\nNot only is your puppy new to the world, but they are also new to training, which is not something that comes naturally to them. Staying patient during training will keep your training positive for your puppy, which will keep them excited and engaged.\nBottom line\nPuppies are so much fun to train. Staying patient, consistent, and engaging will help you get the most out of your training sessions. Be sure to keep your training sessions short, in a distraction-free environment to start. And always use high-value treats and positive reinforcement. Most of all, have fun!\nReferences\nBatt, Lara, et al. “The Effects of Structured Sessions for Juvenile Training and Socialization on Guide Dog Success and Puppy-Raiser Participation.”Journal of Veterinary Behavior, vol. 3, no. 5, Sept. 2008, pp. 199–206,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2008.05.001.\nBatt, Lara, et al. “The Effects of Structured Sessions for Juvenile Training and Socialization on Guide Dog Success and Puppy-Raiser Participation.”Journal of Veterinary Behavior, vol. 3, no. 5, Sept. 2008, pp. 199–206,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2008.05.001.\nBatt, Lara, et al. “Relationships between Puppy Management Practices and Reported Measures of Success in Guide Dog Training.”Journal of Veterinary Behavior, vol. 5, no. 5, Sept. 2010, pp. 240–246,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2010.02.004.\nBatt, Lara, et al. “Relationships between Puppy Management Practices and Reported Measures of Success in Guide Dog Training.”Journal of Veterinary Behavior, vol. 5, no. 5, Sept. 2010, pp. 240–246,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2010.02.004.\nMeunier, LaVonne D. “Selection, Acclimation, Training, and Preparation of Dogs for the Research Setting.”ILAR Journal, vol. 47, no. 4, 1 Jan. 2006, pp. 326–347,academic.oup.com/ilarjournal/article/47/4/326/808937,https://doi.org/10.1093/ilar.47.4.326.\nMeunier, LaVonne D. “Selection, Acclimation, Training, and Preparation of Dogs for the Research Setting.”ILAR Journal, vol. 47, no. 4, 1 Jan. 2006, pp. 326–347,academic.oup.com/ilarjournal/article/47/4/326/808937,https://doi.org/10.1093/ilar.47.4.326.",

    "page_content": "As dog parents, wedote on our pupsconstantly, obsess over their every move, and maybe buy them cute little outfits for special occasions. And just like those who’ve sired human offspring, we, too, tend to develop a list of words to avoid saying in front of our babies.\nWhile people with kids might spell out things like “i-c-e-c-r-e-a-m” to dodge certain meltdowns after dinner, dog parents often become walking thesauruses for words like “walk,” “outside,” and “dinner.” The logic here is fairly obvious. No one likes a tease, including our pups. (Have you ever seen your dog’s face when they mistakenly expect a treat? I wouldn’t wish that heart-piercing look of betrayal on anyone!) And so, guided by the fear of disappointing our best friends, we bust out the synonyms or our spelling-bee skills.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhen I want to know if my boyfriend is ready to go outside with the dogs, I never actually use those words. Instead, I’ll throw out a casual, “Do you want to go downstairs?” The word “dinner” often gets spelled out — “d-i-n-n-e-r” — or we’ll get creative and use something like “chow.” The system is foolproof, but I’ll admit, I sometimes wonder if it’s actually necessary. My dogs generally ignore much of what I say — including, sometimes, when I actuallywanttheir attention. Are they really going to notice or care if I use the word “beach” and do not immediately pack their portable bowls and towels into the station wagon?\nAs with so many pet-care questions, the answer is, “It depends.” According to the experts I spoke with, your dog’s reactivity will likely come down to how you usually communicate.\nWill your dog be disappointed if they hear “outside” and don’t get to go outside?\nAnecdotally, yes — probably. But not for long. According to Eileen Koval, certified dog behavior consultant with the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants, our dogs “may feel stressed or even tricked if we have created such strong meanings and powerful emotions by repeatedly using the word in conjunction with a certain activity” and then do not complete the expected activity.\n“If dogs are already at a place where they seem disappointedor confused,” Koval says, “it can be helpful to direct them to another enjoyable activity.” If the issue arises repeatedly, you might want to avoid using the word altogether.\nFortunately for us, dogs have shorter memories than we do, so rest assured, if you say the word “dinner” around your dog and fail to deliver one time, they likely won’t be scarred for life.\nWill your dog stop trusting you after multiple misunderstandings?\nPossibly, but not necessarily.\nAccording to Koval, dogs can sometimes begin to mistrust us over time if we repeatedly stoke their expectations and then don’t deliver. “They may begin to ignore other things that the human says,” she warns, or fail to follow other cues we’ve trained.\n“Trust is built initially through positive transactions — we say we will do something and then we follow through, or we ask them to do something and then we follow through with a reward,” Koval says. “When there are promises that are not kept (from their perspective) they eventually may lose trust.”\nAt the same time, Dr. Zachary Silver, director of Occidental College Canine Intelligence Lab, says context matters. “Hopefully, people aren’t getting their dog’s attention, saying ‘walk,’ and then not taking them for a walk,” he says. “Hopefully, this is coming from the context of eavesdropping, in which case, maybe they become a bit more discerning about when they respond. They start to recognize that that word only carries meaning for them when it is used with dog-directed speech.”\nAs with most aspects of dog training, the key here is consistency. To keep yourdog’s trust, help them understand what speech is meant for them and what is not. Reward them when they respond correctly, and redirect their energy toward something more productive when they’re disappointed. And if all else fails, you can always go back to spelling things out.\nDo dogs actually understand human speech?\nYes and no.\nAccording Silver, there are different schools of thought on this question. That said, the bulk of the evidence suggests that dogs can form associations between words and concepts through repetition.\n“So if you say ‘outside’ every time you take your dog outside, they’ll eventually learn what that is,” Silver says. “...But it really is based on the association between the word that you’re saying and that next step.”\nStill, dogs’ brains don’t work the same as ours. They take longer to learn new words, and they don’t have the linguistic flexibility to understand the difference between, say, “Do you want to go outside?” and “Do you want to go outside in an hour?” In that sense, we need to be deliberate in how we speak around them.\nThe best way to communicate with your dog is through something called “dog-directed speech,” and the good news is, many of us do this automatically. You know thatdog voicewe all have, where we raise our timbre and perhaps speak slower than usual? That’s a hallmark of dog-directed speech, alongside two other tools — establishing eye contact and starting sentences with their names. For example: “Lucky, do you want to go outside?”\nDogs pick up new words faster when taught through dog-directed speech, and according to Silver, this way of talking to them can also serve as a potential deterrent for  the eavesdropping that we mentioned above — that is,dogs listening to our conversationsand picking out relevant words. So, if you want to be able to use words like “dinner” and “beach” in casual conversation, make sure to only use dog-directed speech when teaching your dog new words. The rest of the time, use these words like normal so that your dog can learn the distinction.\nAre our dogs always listening?\nThis is where the “it depends” part comes into play. Every dog is different, and so is theirlevel of attentiveness. It also matters how you normally communicate with your dog.\n“If you primarily communicate with your dog using dog directed speech, then they'll likely only interpret those words as being salient to them when you’ve produced that similar speech directed towards them,” Silver says.\nOn the other hand, there’s always a chance that dogs’ word associations will grow strong enough that they begin to pick them up in regular speech, especially if you often talk to them in your normal voice — something Koval has noticed with words like “dinner,” “park,” “walk,” and “ball.”\n“I think it is important to continue using words in non-dog related contexts in normal tones of voice so that they can learn when the word is a predictor of something pertaining to them — and also when it is not a predictor,” Koval says.\nIf you use an exciting word around your dog and they don’t react, you can assume they don’t expect anything. In these situations, Koval says, “they likely hear the word just fine but do not have an over-emphasis on its meeting as always pertaining to them.” That kind of interaction is healthy.",

    },
    "page_content": "Pet parents, like any parent, have a lot of fears that can rise up in our chests in the middle of the night, seemingly out of nowhere. One of them — I shudder to even think about it — is that our dogs will run away from us and won’t come back. No matter how many weeks or months you spend carefullyteaching them recall, even working with a trainer, there is every chance they might just decide to split. Maybe your dog is particularly squirrel-motivated, maybe they love to run, or maybe they just live to set off every fear trigger in your body.In that moment, it’s hard to think of anything but just running after them as fast as you can. Even if theyhave a microchip(and they should), you never want to lose sight of them. Unfortunately, though, it’s pretty tough to outrun most breeds of dog if they really want to go somewhere. So, what do pet parents do when their beloved pups run away?\nAs usual, TikTok has a tip for us. Thisviral videopresents a trick for for when your dog just won't come back to you: simply flip the switch, and run away from them so that theyhaveto chase you — aka make it a game. ARover sittertried the TikTok-suggested move when her client‘s dog made a break for it out of an open garage. After chasing the puppy for “eight to nine blocks,“ she turned around and let her chase her — and it worked. She told the story in a video with the caption“She’s a runner. She‘s a track star.“ She was incredibly grateful to the original poster for the advice: “I could literally kiss you on the lips right now.“\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nOne commenter, on the sitter’s video, @zeomlette, said this hack worked for them, too. “I’m also a sitter on Rover — this works! I alsoput Apple AirTagson the dogs when they come in for extra security.“ But another commenter, @juliebugggg7, made clear this wasn’t an effective technique on her dog: “Can confirm this does NOT work for Huskies.“\nSo, that begs the question: How effectiveisthis trick? Let’s ask the experts.\nThe hack might work, but teaching recall is still your best defense.\nLauren Hewitt-Watts, the founder ofDog Mom Mindset, an online dog training school, says that “in certain situations, it may help to turn around and run away to get the dog to start to chase y\nou,” but the dog must be off-leash in a relatively safe environment. However, she adds, it might not work with dogs who arevery frightenedor who arefollowing a scent. Her advice would be to use a long leash or a GPS tracker for dogs who are prone to running away.\nSian Lawley-Rudd, the founder of animal training schoolLavender Garden Animal Servicessays that the TikTok technique can work in certain situations. “Running away taps into a dog’s naturalchase instinct, many dogs find movement far more engaging than simply hearing their name. It’s a great emergency tool, but it’s not a guaranteed fix for all dogs, especially those with\nstrong independent instincts or fear-based behaviors,” she says.\nDog trainerKate LaSalaagrees. “While this\n‘trick’ may work for some dogs by triggering their chase instinct, it’s not something I would often confidently rely on as a trained recall,” she says. “Recall, or coming when called, is one of the few life-saving skills we can teach a dog and is something I recommend people put a lot of training resources towards. Recall is not a skill dogs come pre-wired with. Their instincts tell the\nm to follow their nose or eyes and chase critters, sniff, seek mates, find food, and avoid threats.”\nBy training this skill, LaSala adds, we teach them that coming back pays off better than all those other fun things. If we practice the skill in multiple scenarios, aka“proofing,” it only strengthens their recall even more.\nBut recall takes work\nto master.\nLawley-Rudd says that reliable recall is about more than just one trick; it’s a step-by-step process. That’s why she developed what she calls the “R.E.C.A.L.L. process,” which breaks the skill into simple and effective steps. She shared those steps with us to ensure better recall success.\nR:“Recognize why recall fails. Most dogs ignore recall because they’ve learned it’s optional, or their environment is more rewarding.”\nE:“Eliminate failure with ma\nnagement. Using tools like long leads, controlled environments, and avoiding over-cueing prevents recall failures and sets y\nou both up for success.”\nC:“Capture your dog’s motivation. Discovering and supercharging your dog’s favorite things, suchas food,toys or environmental rewards, makes\ncomi\nng back more exciting than running away.”\nA:“Attention and engagement first! You and your dog need to have a good relationship for recall success. You also need to ensure their needs as a dog are being met.” (Lawley-Rudd says a reward can be as simple as taking them on asniff walk; these treats don’t always need to be in the form of food.)\nL:“Level up with training games. Recall games like ‘Ping Pong Recall’ can make recall fun and reinforce success in different settings.”\nL:“Layer in proofing and distraction work.” Lawley-Rudd adds that this final step is to gradually increase distractions — such as other dog\ns, scents, and wildlife — in a structured way so recall remains reliable anywhere.\nShe also says that you should avoid\nover-cueing. Repeating their name or words like “come” can teach them to tune you out. Say it once, then use movement and positive sounds to r\neinforce it. By teaching recall in controlled environments before expecting your dog to be reliable in a busy park, you can minimize the chances of them running away in the first place.\nRemember, foundational training is your best friend.\n“While the viral running trick is one tool in the toolbox, true recall success comes from understanding motivation, managing distractions, relationship and layering proofing gradually,” Lawley-Rudd says.\nA dog running away from you can be incredibly scary — in some ways, even more so when they aren’t your dog! Your brain might always go to the worst-case scenario, and it’s difficult to remain calm in that moment. But preventing them from running away in the first place and having strong recall methods in place can reinforce you in emergency situations. This viral “run-away” trick might help in some select scenarios, but your relationship with your dog will always be the most important thing.",

    },
    "page_content": "Dog training is a field that has so-called experts everywhere you look. But if you are getting training advice from people without education and experience in dog training, you may be hearing more fiction than fact. Top-notch dog trainers typically have formal education about the process, have been training for many years, and are certified through one or more professional organizations.\nJust as trainers should not give medical or grooming advice, groomers, rescue workers, veterinarians, etc. should not give training advice unless they also have true expertise in the area. It’s best to listen to dog-training professionals to learn the real scoop, rather than be led astray by the many common myths about dog training.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHere are some not-so-true statements I hear all the time that I’d like to set straight.\n1. Dogs who don’t respond to a cue are being stubborn.\nThere’s a tendency to assume that if a dog doesn’t do what they’ve been asked to do, it’s because they are stubborn, and that’s not fair. There are so many reasons dogs don’t respond to cues, and one of the first ones is that they have not been trained to respond to them in a variety of contexts. Maybe they can come when called at home, where nothing is distracting them. But if they don’tcome running at the sound of their nameat the park, that doesn’t mean they are obstinate. It might just mean that environment is too distracting for them.\nIf they sit sometimes but not all the time, maybe it hurts them to sit because they havejoint pain. In that case, they are more likely to do it in the morning than at night after their body has been through too much.\n2. Using food in training is bribery.\nIf it’s done right, using food to train is a form ofpositive reinforcement. After the dog performs the behavior you are training them to do, yougive them a treat, which means you are reinforcing that behavior. You are using positive reinforcement to increase the likelihood of them doing that skill again.\nIf you show a dog a treat and then ask them to do something, that is bribery, and you will end up with a dog who only performs the behavior you requestifthey see the goods up front. That approach doesn’t work well for training, to say the least. So, the technique and timing of using food can be a problem, but the fooditselfis not.\n3. You should wait until your dog is fully vaccinated to begin training.\nIt’s true that puppies who have not been fully vaccinated need to be protected from exposure to serious diseases. That meansno dog parks, no boarding kennels, and following advice from your veterinarian about other high-risk situations. It doesnotmean they shouldn’t begin training. Training inpuppy classeswith other puppies who have at least started their vaccinations is relatively safe. Plus, the advantages of socialization, bonding, and training are worthwhile for healthy puppies.\nIn addition, so much training can be done at home, on walks, during visits to the veterinarian, in the backyard, and anywhere else you go with your puppy.\n4. Positive reinforcement only works for easy cases and easy dogs.\nPositive reinforcement isincredibly powerful. There is a strange idea in the world of dogs that gentle, kind, positive treatment of others may be nice, but it is not as effective as being harsh, nagging, whining, or even using physical force. I stand by the idea that force is the absence of real power, and that reward-based training is powerful enough forallkinds of behavior goals.\nI believe that when people don’t see that positive reinforcement can be used to train dogs, even intough cases, they likely don’t know enough about the training method or have the skills to use it effectively in the real world.\n5. Training your dog to do tricks is fun but is otherwise useless.\nTrick-training has advantages far beyond having a dog who can show off some impressive skills. The training is fun and often not a high-pressure activity. People often get stressed and upset if their dog doesn’t come when called or hold their stay. If a dog doesn’t quite nail a skill like wave orroll over, pet parents have a tendency to shrug and say, “Oh, well!” Trick-training is often really fun and not fraught with expectations the same way some other training is. The interaction is typically happy, which is good for your relationship with your dog.\nDogs get to be right and have all the benefits of positive reinforcement, like treats, praise, and play, without any disappointment from people. The mental exercise is good for them, tiring out their brains and preventing boredom. In addition, many tricks can be really practical. For example, when I lived on a farm, I often had my dog crawl through snow before coming inside so he brought less mud inside.\nI teach dogs topresent their paws as a shaketo make it easier to draw blood at the vet and teach them to go belly-up to make exams easier. (I use the cue “smoke” so I can say to a dog, “What happens when you smoke?” When they hear this, they lie on their back with their legs in the air.)\n6. Dog training needs to be done in formal sessions.\nThere’s nothing wrong with training in formal sessions, and I love dog-training classes as well as working on skills at home in designated periods. Your dog is always learning, whether you mean to be teaching them at that moment or not. That can work against you if you, say, accidentally teach your dog that you will pet them and give them attention when they jump up on you.\nHowever, it can also be used to your advantage. For example, if your dog comes running whenever they hear you open a treat bag, you can call, “Come!” right before you rattle the bag so your dog learns that good things happen around you when they hear that cue.\nSome of the best training occurs as life happens and in very short sessions, not in a formal session with separate time set aside. So, you can ask your dog to wait beforeletting them out of the crate, ask them to sit before you put on their leash prior to a walk, or give them a cue to lie down before feeding them. Here’s an excellent training practice: Grab a handful of treats, and for 10 to 30 seconds, work on teaching your dog to do something you want them to do. Or you can ask them to do what they already know and them a treat every time they wave, sit, shake, spin, etc.\n7. All you need is an understanding of training methods.\nTraining dogs effectively requires more than just an understanding of specific approaches — you need more. The best training is possible when there is a good relationship between the trainer and the dog. And to achieve that, it’s essential to have the following:\ngood observation skills\ngood observation skills\na training plan so you know how to advance through the process\na training plan so you know how to advance through the process\nan ability to read dog body language\nan ability to read dog body language\ngood timing\ngood timing\nhigh-quality reinforcement\nhigh-quality reinforcement\na situation in which the dog can concentrate enough to succeed\na situation in which the dog can concentrate enough to succeed\nknowledge based on experience of when to stop a training session\nknowledge based on experience of when to stop a training session\nflexibility\nflexibility\nThe takeaway: Find these training truths for yourself.\nTraining our dogs is easier and more effective when we know the truth and aren’t being led astray by any pesky myths. When it comes to learning about dog training, rely on information from the actual experts: dog trainers. Their expertise is the real treat!",

    "page_content": "Aren’t dogs supposed to love going on walks? Every blog I read says walks will make dogs happy, and that we should spell out “w-a-l-k” so they don’t go bananas every time they hear the actual word. Except maybe you have a dog who doesn’t jump around in excited circles every time you get out the leash. To be honest, it seems like they could care less about taking a w-a-l-k. Are you wondering,Did I just adopt the only dog on the planet who doesn’t know a walk is supposed to be their favorite part of the day?Luckily, you're not.\nIt’s true that most dogs live for their daily trek around the neighborhood (OK, that and treats, chasing squirrels, and of course,cuddles with you). But every dog is different, and not all of them know Dog Code 101. Below are seven reasons why a dog may resist a stroll, and some suggestions for exercise alternatives you can try instead.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThey’re very young.\nA lot of puppies are not interested in walks. They dawdle, dig their heels in, and generally can’t get with the program, and that’s OK. It’s important to get them used to wearing a collar andusing a leash, but if they only want to be in the yard or just go a short distance on the sidewalk, that’s what you should do.\nYou can’t gain much by pushing them. Instead,encourage them with treatsor a toy, keep it short, and gradually make your strolls longer over the early weeks and months. Some puppies become better walkers if you carry them (or drive them) a block away andthenhoof it back home. Many puppies are more eager to return to the familiarity of their house than they are to wander off into the great unknown.\nThe weather is bad.\nSome dogs can’t tolerate cold, others sayno, thank youtosnow or rain, while others wilt when it’s even the slightest bit warm outside. Many dogs let us know when they object to the weather by refusing to go out in it. Consider it a blessing when dogs communicate their discomfort to us — how else would we know if they don’t like something?\nWe can help make it easier for our dogs to deal with weather extremes by getting them used towearing bootiesand a sweater for snow if they resist snow and cold, use an umbrella if rain is the problem, and stick to shady routes insweltering conditions. It also helps to walk at the warmest time of day in the winter and during the coolest part of the day in summer. And when the rain or snow isreallyheavy, it’s sometimes best just to wait that out.\nThey had a bad experience on a walk.\nDogs canreact to traumamuch like people do. This can cause big changes in how they behave, what they choose to do, and the situations in which they’re comfortable. That’s especially relevant if the dog had a previous traumatic experience.\nIf, in the past, theloudest clap of thunderthey’ve ever heard scared them, anotherdog attacked them, a snowplow hurled chunks of ice on them, or they were hit by a bike, they may associate the fear from that particular walk with going on walks in general. A lot of dogs become scared ofthe placewhere they got freaked out, so some of them will be totally fine if you take them to a completely new location, even if that meansdriving to it.\nWalks are boring for them.\nSome dogs find walks a bit dull. Often, this is the case for pups who love to play and would prefer their outdoor time bededicated to fun and games, not meandering slowly and calmly around the neighborhood. If your dog is all about high-energy adventures and not super into leisurely strolls, you might be able to make outings more appealing to them. Going faster can sometimes help, especially if you arewilling to run withthem.\nYou don’t have to turn the entire jaunt into a run — just add some bursts of speed into your outing to liven things up. It can also help to change the pace and directions often. Some dogs prefer a route with lots ofinteresting smells, so try exploring new places; this could be in a big city, on rural trails, or at a park. Another option is to bring a toy along andhead to a fenced-in areato play, or evenengage in some tugwhile you’re on the move. If your dog is social, they may enjoywalking with another dog.\nThey are not comfortable with the leash or collar.\nSome dogs are more resistant to the gear they have to wear than the walk itself. Not all dogs are comfortable with a leash-and-collar situation. Sometimes, that’s because they’re not used to wearing these things. In that case, it’s necessary to teach them to be comfortable with them. To do that, put the leash and collar on, and give them a really yummy, high-value treat, likepeanut butteror chicken. Then take it off for a beat, but put it back on and give them more treats.\nDoing thisthree to five times each dayfor a few weeks will help most dogs feel good about the accessories they used to reject. It can also help to try using different gear. Many dogs dislike having something around their neck, or they detest theloud sound of a clipso close to their ears, so a harness may work better. In general, most dogs have an easier time with a smaller, lighter clip or thinner leashes and smaller collars, rather than any that are too chunky and heavy. So, going minimalist with them may also make a big difference.\nThey are in pain.\nIf a dog has an illness or injury, and it hurts them to go on a walk, they will naturally resist going. Pain or stiffness is more easily recognized in older dogs because we expect it, but younger dogs may be suffering, too. If you even suspect your pup might be in pain, it’s essential to consult with your veterinarian right away.\nSome of thesigns of a dog in painare:\nThey are slow to get up from a resting position.\nThey are slow to get up from a resting position.\nThey have have good days and bad days with their mobility.\nThey have have good days and bad days with their mobility.\nThey object to the kind of touching and petting they used to enjoy, or their change in behavior came on suddenly.\nThey object to the kind of touching and petting they used to enjoy, or their change in behavior came on suddenly.\nThey get overwhelmed easily.\nMany dogs find walks overwhelming; there’s always the possibility of running into unfamiliar people,dealing with loud noiseslike trucks or a jackhammer at a construction site, loose dogs running up to them, or finding themselves in a new place that makes them uncomfortable.\nFor a dog who isgenerally anxious,is triggered by new things, or can’t handle the unexpected skateboarder or bike rider whizzing past, walks may not be a fun time. If it’s possible, find a more peaceful setting, such as a trail away from crowds.\nSome non-walk exercise alternatives to consider\nIf your dog is completely overwhelmed by walks,consider offering other enrichment opportunities. The point of walks is to give your dog some much-needed stimulation and let them stretch their legs, but they can get the same benefits from other activities. If you play fetch,puzzle games, or tug, or try trick-training andnose work, some dogs will be far happier. Others wouldenjoy swimming,training classes,agility lessons, or playing hide-and-seek at home. Other alternative exercise options include: chase games with you, play dates with other dogs, or lots of training sessions.\nWhile most dogs enjoy going on walks, there are plenty of reasons why some don’t. Think of a walk like a party. Many peoplelovegoing to parties and think you can’t have too many on your social calendar, but plenty of other people consider them torture (for a variety of reasons).\nWhen you recognize that your particular pup is not a fan of walks, you are gaining great insight into who they are. When you allow them to tell you what activities they prefer,you are honoring who they areas an individual. It’s another way toshow our dogs we love them, and that’s always worth doing.",

      "title": "5 Ways to Make Sure Your Dog Behaves When You Bring Them to a Restaurant",
      "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/train-dog-to-behave-at-restaurants"
    },
    "page_content": "Ever wondered if your dog has what it takes tobe your coffee buddy, or if they’re destined to be banned from every patio in town? Spoiler: Many pups can learn to behave beautifully at restaurants and cafés that allow dogs, but it doesn’t just happen because you want it to.\nIt’s sofun to bring your dog with youto your favorite outdoor restaurant or to check out the newest spot to grab a bite — it’s just so satisfying to give your dog a new experience and to avoid those sad eyes when you head out the door without them. If they come along, there’s no rushing home to let them out and no guilt about leaving them behind. Plus, how fun is it to have people say “Aww,” look at your dog with loving eyes, and tell you what a great pup you have? Face it: Life is better together, and that includes mealtime.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nYou’ll need to do some prep and training to make sure the whole crew (you, your dog, and other patrons) have a good time, though. So, how do you “café-train” your dog to be the ultimate dining companion?\nTeach your dog the must-have skills they’ll need.\nLet’s be real — it won’t be cool if your dog jumps on a stranger at a restaurant or helps themself to something an unsuspecting diner drops on the ground. If you want your dog to be the perfect dining sidekick, they’ve got to have some solid skills. They need to be able to walk nicely on a leash, greet people politelywithout jumping upor sniffing them (awkward!), and stay calm. Nobody’s dreams of the perfect night out include being seated next to a jumping, barking ball of fur. (OK, maybemydreams. But I won’t necessarily be around when you go out to eat with your dog, unless you’re at a Cuban restaurant — then I’mthere.)\nDogs should be good at resisting the urge to eat something that falls on the groundif told to“leave it,” focus their attention on you while basically ignoring other people, and hold a “stay” for the entire time you’re there. If you teach your dog to lie down and stay on a blanket no matter where you put it (under the table, behind your chair), you can more easily get them to be — and remain there during your meal.\nPrep ahead of time.\nPreparation is always essential; think of it as a pre-game but for dogs. Before you head to the restaurant, review your pup’s dining-out manners with them. Do a minute or so of nice leash-walking, practice telling them to “leave it” and work on having them “stay” on their blanket. Move it to different places, and have them stay for a moment each time. Doing this training right before you head out reminds them of the behavior you want from them and also tires out their brain, making it easier for them to settle, rather than cause a scene when you get there.\nOh, and don’t forget tobring the treats! Along with treats, bring food toys orthings to chew onso they have something to keep them occupied — those long-lasting snacks are a lifesaver for your sanity.\nSet your dog up for success.\nMake it as easy as possible for your dog to behave well by setting them up for success. Go to the restaurant after they havehad a lot of exercise— like along hike— or after they’ve been tired out by a goodplay sessionwith their best buddy. That will create a far easier situation than trying to go out after they’ve been at home for hours, building up social and physical energy. If there is a time of day they’re most likely to be settled, go to the restaurant then, rather than when they are predictably all amped up. You don’t want to hit the restaurant just when those good ol’zoomies are most likely to hit.\nChoose the most dog-friendly place you can so the pressure is down a bit, making it easier for you to relax and your dog to succeed. Avoid super-crowded places for your first few tries. You want your dog to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. And keep those first trips short — maybe just bring them when you get coffee or a quick snack. Gradually level up to a full meal.\nActively manage the situation.\nNo matter how well you’ve prepared your dog to join you at dinner, be proactive about managing the situation from the moment you arrive until you leave. Choose their spot carefully by putting them in an area with the least amount of activity from guests or staff. Here’s a genius move: Face them away from the entrance so they are not anxious about everyone coming and going. Always be on the lookout, monitoring the situation for possible challenges or distractions so you can take action right away to help your dogbeforethey react.\nWhile you’re there, don’t forget to give them lots of praise and pets. Dole out treats and toys on the regular to make sure they don’t get bored. You can give them treats for looking at you,rolling on their side, or any other behavior you specifically ask for, but you can also give them treats to reinforce staying on their blanket and being calm. Try to sit in the same spot each time if you can so you can make it your dog’s happy place.\nBe flexible.\nOK, real talk: Not every dog is destined to be the next foodie influencer. If they seem stressed, it’s best to cut the excursion short and try again another time. A few outings may be necessary to decide for sure if this will work for your dog, so don’t give up after just one time. Every dog is different, and you know your pup best. No shame in leaving early if things aren’t working out. (To-go containers are athingfor a reason!)\nIf your dog is naturally calm, emotionally controlled, and waswell-socialized as a puppy,there’s a good chance you both can enjoy going to a restaurant together. However, even the most well-behaved dogs can have an off day. Theymight be feeling sick, beobsessed with incoming bad weather, or smell something intriguing nearby. If they’re not having fun, there’s no need to force it. Your dog’s comfort and happiness are the priority.\nEnjoy the adventure with your dog.\nIt’s super fun to take a well-behaved, well-prepared dog out to eat with you — just make sure you’ve prepped them for success. With some patience and practice, you’ll both be able to enjoy a meal out without worrying about any “dog drama.” And hey, it’s way more fun than dining solo.",

    },
    "page_content": "Proper training isessential for all dogs. It teaches and reinforces good behaviors, providesmuch-needed mental stimulation, and deepens the canine-human bond. It can also be frustratingly slow-going, especially as the cues and behaviors you are trying to teach your pup get more and more complicated. And while a cue like “sit” or “lie down” may beeasy to learnin just a few minutes, if you want your dog to actually retain their newly acquired skill, it takes time, repetition, and, according to a2017 study out of Hungary, a whole lot of sleep.\nAnna Kis and her colleagues at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest conducted a pair of experiments to investigate the link between sleep and memory in domesticated dogs.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nIn the first experiment, dogs were taught a new cue for an existing behavior like “sit” or “lay down” and were then encouraged to take a three-hour nap. During that time, they received a non-invasive, comprehensive sleep study (polysomnography session). They were then retested on their new cue. All the dogs performed their new cues better after the nap than they did prior to their snooze. Researchers also found that there were indications that the pups may have slept more deeply after learning the new cue.\nSleep appears to have big benefits for dogs.\nThis outcome is not surprising, according to dog behavior expert and trainerNicole Kohanski. “Sleep definitely helps dogs process new information,” she says. “At theAcademy for Dog Trainers, we call this ‘roll forward.’ Sometimes, sleeping on it works to help solidify the learning. This can be a nap or overnight. We see this every day!”\nKohanski says, in her own training work, she’s also observed that dogs sleep more deeply after training. “I feel like every dog we work with sleeps well after training sessions,” she says. “Anything we can do to exercise their brains helps predict a good sleep, including training, sniffing on walks,and nosework.”\nDog behavior expert and celebrity dog trainerJessica Jacobsonagrees. “People often forget that mental exercise isjust as importantfor dogs as physical exercise,” she says. “Sometimes, 10 minutes of mental stimulation is even more exhausting to a dog than 20 minutes of physical exertion, so it makes sense that they would sleep better after a challenging training session.”\nFor the Hungarian team’s second experiment, dogs were once again taught a new cue. But this time that learning session was followed by an hour of either sleep, walking on leash, unrelated training, orplay time with a Kongtoy. The dogs were then retested with their newly acquired cue and then tested again a week later.\nSleeping after training did not appear to have a positive impact on the dog’s ability to remember the newly acquired cue in the short-term (after one hour), but it did have a positive impact in the long-term (after one week). Kis and her team suspect the lack of improvement in the short-term may have had to do with the fact that the dogs only slept for an hour, as opposed to in the previous experiment, where they slept for three hours. Once they were able to go home and get a proper night’s sleep (seven, even) they showed marked improvement in responding to their new cues.\nDogs who went for a walk during that one-hour break also showed no signs of improvement in the short-term, but they did show advancement in the long-term, again, after seven full nights of quality sleep.\nPer Jacobson,walks can be a great wayof breaking up the monotony of training. “Some dogs, especially really smart dogs, like Poodles, don’t necessarily enjoy the repetitive nature of training, so you need to break it up with other activities,” she says. “Whether the best way to do that is with a walk or play or a nap depends on the preferences of the individual dog.”\nWhile dogs who napped or walked for an hour after training showed no change in short-term recall of their new cues, dogs who played with a Kong toy or trained unrelated skills during that hour actually didworsein the same time frame. This makes sense to Jacobson. “A working toy with food is generally going to distract a dogmorefrom training because it is more valuable to them,” she says. “It switches them from being 100 percent engaged with you to 100 percent engaged with themselves and this toy, and that can tire them out.”\nKeep these tricks for success in mind.\nOne of the keys to effective dog training is making sure that your dog is both “not too tired and not too wired,” Jacobson says. High-value toys, like a Kongfull of treats, can sometimes lead to overstimulation, followed by exhaustion. And that’s fine as long as you don’t expect your dog to perform their new cue right after they play. In fact, Jacobson often recommends pet parents use working toys like Kongsaftertraining to help transition dogs out of a training session and into rest. She says ending too abruptly can frustrate some dogs and lead to unwanted behaviors.\nKis’s experiment found that when the dogs spent the post-training hour training additional, unrelated skills, their ability to perform the new cue worsened both in the short-term and in the long-term periods. “That makes sense,” says Jacobson. “Their brains were probably overloaded, and the cues got all mixed up.”\nThat’s not to say that you can’t train more than one skill at a time. But, according to both Jacobson and Kohanski, most training sessions should only be between five and 10 minutes, not an hour plus, like in Kis’s experiment.\nSo why, then, do most professional dog-training sessions last an hour? “Because you’re not just training the dog, you’re training the human,” says Jacobson, who insists that any training session should include breaks as needed. “When training, it’s important to read your dog’sbody languageand if they are turning away from you or becoming unresponsive, don’t push them to keep going.”\nAccording to Kohanski, dogs experience four stages of learning. They are:\nAcquisition: when the dog first learns the cue\nAcquisition: when the dog first learns the cue\nFluency: the period of time it takes to improve the speed and accuracy of the skill\nFluency: the period of time it takes to improve the speed and accuracy of the skill\nGeneralization: when your dog can practice the skill in varied places and situations\nGeneralization: when your dog can practice the skill in varied places and situations\nMaintenance: the continued training needed for your pup to maintain the cue\nMaintenance: the continued training needed for your pup to maintain the cue\n“Dogs can usually acquire a new cue quickly, sometimes in just a few minutes,” she says. “The generalization stage is the one that takes a bit more time.”\nRemember to control their training environment.\nIn order to maximize your dog’s chances of retaining new cues, Kohanski and Jacobson both recommend training in calm, familiar environments where they are able to focus on what you’re doing together. During the maintenance stage, you can andshouldtrain existing skills in progressively more foreign and challenging environments, but do your best to minimize outside stimuli and distractions to start.\nKohinski also recommends using “a marker word like ‘yes’” ora clickerto mark the exact moment the dog responds properly to a cue, then providing a treat-reward right after.”\nThe treat should be high-value to the dog (something they want and are willing to work for), but not so high-value that they become fixated on it and are unable to focus on the task at hand. “Really, you want to use the lowest-value treat possible,” Jacobson adds. “That way, you have somewhere to go, and you can save the truly high-value treats for more advanced training and emergency situations like when you are trying tocurb aggressionorrecall your dogfrom a dangerous situation.”\nIf all this is feeling a little overwhelming,don’tworry. The most important part of dog training is repetition and consistency. You don’t have to do everything perfectly. Just don’t overtrain them with too many skills at once, don’t train for more than five or 10 minutes at a time, and remember that if they are struggling to respond properly to a new cue, they may just need agood night’s sleep.",

Here’s how to clean them up.\nWhy do dogs dig on the couch?\nYour dog likely wants to sit on the sofa to be near you and rest comfortably, but the behavior can be a problem if they dig at the cushions.\n“Dogs dig at the couch and other furniture for a wide range of reasons,” Patterdale says. “Many dogs enjoy nesting, and so they may dig in the couch in order to create a comfortable spot to rest. Dogs may also dig in the couch because there are crumbs, food, treats, etc., buried in the cushions.”\nSome dogs may also dig at the couch as an attention-seeking behavior or even out of boredom, so make sure your pup gets plenty of exercise and purchase some interactive toys to stimulate their mind. If it’s a hot summer day, your dog may simply be looking for a cool spot, and digging at the sofa is their way of finding one.\n5 tips to keep your dog off the sofa\n“When it comes to keeping your dog off the sofa, set your dog up for success,” Patterdale recommends.\nSome ways to do this? “Don’t leave them unattended in rooms where you don’t want them on furniture. Then, make places youdowant your dog, like their bed, a highly rewarding place to be. Rewarding your dog for being where you want them is the fastest way to keep your dog off the places where you don’t want them.”\nHere are some other tips for keeping your dog off the sofa.\nThe best way to stop a dog from getting on the couch is never to allow them on the furniture from the beginning. Make sure you set clear boundaries and don’t have different rules for different furniture throughout the house. Be consistent in keeping your dog off the sofa and ensure that everyone in the family and visitorsadhere to the rules.\nIf you want your dog off the sofa,create a comfortable placefor them to rest near where you hang out. Choose a plush dog bed that’s large enough for them, and add blankets, favorite toys, and other bedding to make the space more inviting.\nSince you can’t easily monitor your dog’s behavior when you’re out of the house, consider blocking access to the sofawhen you’re gone.Crate train your dogor gate off the area around the couch. Your pup is less likely to try to jump on the furniture if it’s inconvenient for them to do so.\nPositive reinforcementtraining can also go a long way, especially withyoung dogs, but you can train an adult dog, too. Reward your dog with treats for avoiding the furniture. You can also use clicker training. Just make sure to train consistently and regularly to help reinforce the behavior you want.\nIf you try all the above solutions and nothing works, you may need to consider a compromise — or even letting your dog win. Some people allow their pets on the furniture, and that’s fine. You may just want to invest in waterproof pet blankets or couch covers to protect your sofa.\nIn between cuddle sessions, work on these eight basic cues with your pup.\nHow to deter your dog from jumping on the sofa\nIf you’re frantically googling “how to keep my dog off the sofa,” you’re likely to find a lot of suggestions, but it’s important to choose a method that works best for your dog and their particular personality. Deterrents can be helpful when it comes to keeping your pet off the couch, but they work best when paired with consistent training. Focus on thoseobedience basicswhile also considering these solutions.\nPlacing aluminum foil on the couch, especially when you’re away from home, can deter your dog from jumping on the sofa. The uncomfortable texture and crinkly noise make the couch cushions significantly less appealing.\nMaking noise, such as shaking coins in a jar when your dog jumps on the sofa, may deter them from jumping up there in the future. Just consider whether your dog is already easily startled by loud noises, such as thunder or fireworks. You don’t want to give your pup a new fear or make an existing one worse.\nWhen you’re away from home or out of the room, you can physically block the sofa so your dog can’t access it. If the room has a door, simply close it or use baby gates to keep your pet away from the couch. You can also set up cushions as a barrier around the furniture.\nIf you need a stronger deterrent for a dog on the couch, consider investing in products like couch defenders or training mats. Couch defenders are small barriers that you can place around furniture to keep pets away. They’re available in neutral colors to match your decor and can be easily folded up and stored when you have company.\nTraining mats are placed directly on the couch cushions and are available in a variety of sizes. They can be covered in small, pointy nubs that are uncomfortable for your dog to sit on, or there are more high-tech versions that emit an annoying noise or a small static shock when your dog touches them. Both options are safe deterrents to help keep your dog away from your furniture.\nReferences\n“5 Tips for Successful Dog Training.”Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine | Virginia Tech,vetmed.vt.edu/news/2023/dog-training-tips.html.\n“5 Tips for Successful Dog Training.”Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine | Virginia Tech,vetmed.vt.edu/news/2023/dog-training-tips.html.\nBasic Dog Training Concepts.www4.uwsp.edu/psych/dog/la/drp12.htm.\nBasic Dog Training Concepts.www4.uwsp.edu/psych/dog/la/drp12.htm.\nBoston, City of. “Pet Behavior Tips.”Boston.gov, 23 Nov. 2019,www.boston.gov/departments/animal-care-and-control/pet-behavior-tips.\nBoston, City of. “Pet Behavior Tips.”Boston.gov, 23 Nov. 2019,www.boston.gov/departments/animal-care-and-control/pet-behavior-tips.\n“Digging in Dogs.”Animal Health Topics / School of Veterinary Medicine, 24 Nov. 2021,healthtopics.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/health-topics/canine/why-does-my-dog-dig.\n“Digging in Dogs.”Animal Health Topics / School of Veterinary Medicine, 24 Nov. 2021,healthtopics.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/health-topics/canine/why-does-my-dog-dig.\n“Dog Training | Dog Training Tools.”Community Care College, 3 Apr. 2023,communitycarecollege.edu/veterinary-assistant/dog-training.\n“Dog Training | Dog Training Tools.”Community Care College, 3 Apr. 2023,communitycarecollege.edu/veterinary-assistant/dog-training.\nTodd, Zazie. “All About Dog Training: The Best Way to Train Your Dog.”Companionanimalpsychology.com, Blogger, 6 Oct. 2020,www.companionanimalpsychology.com/p/all-about-dog-training-how-to-train.html\nTodd, Zazie. “All About Dog Training: The Best Way to Train Your Dog.”Companionanimalpsychology.com, Blogger, 6 Oct. 2020,www.companionanimalpsychology.com/p/all-about-dog-training-how-to-train.html\n“Training Tips for Dogs.”VMBS News, 11 Mar. 2022,vetmed.tamu.edu/news/pet-talk/training-tips-for-dogs.\n“Training Tips for Dogs.”VMBS News, 11 Mar. 2022,vetmed.tamu.edu/news/pet-talk/training-tips-for-dogs.\n“Why Do Dogs Chew, Dig and Tear Stuff Up?” Richmond SPCA,www.montgomerycountymd.gov/animalservices/Resources/Files/Preventing%20%Destructive%20Beahvior%20in%20the%20Home%20PDF(1).pdf.\n“Why Do Dogs Chew, Dig and Tear Stuff Up?” Richmond SPCA,www.montgomerycountymd.gov/animalservices/Resources/Files/Preventing%20%Destructive%20Beahvior%20in%20the%20Home%20PDF(1).pdf.",

    },
    "page_content": "Training dogs is one of the great joys of my life, so many clients are surprised when I see a dog’s problematic behavior and don’t immediately suggest some training techniques to fix it. Instead, I might say, “Let’s use management here!” In other words, we can find some simple hacks — aka manage the pup’s environment — first to eliminate anything that might be causing them to, for example, root through the trash,bark at any guestwho comes to your door, or run off to rip up your brand-new couch.\nMaking changes to positively influence the behavior of dogs is popular in the dog-training world, but there’s some shame associated with it among many pet parents. There’s a tendency to think that this approach is a cop-out, but I totally disagree. Management is a great way to help dogs in challenging situations by making iteasierfor them to do the right thing. These simple suggestions that I give my clients are often straightforward and require minimal effort. You may even say “duh” at a few of these and wonder why you never tried them. No worries — that’s why I’m here to help.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nHere are a few of my favorite hacks for preventing problem behavior before it even begins.\nKeep “intruders” out of their sight line.\nBlock the glass portion of your front door with fabric or a poster board to keep your dog from standing there all day getting upset by all the passersby. Some dogs get excited by people outside in a good way, but others watch on edge and survey your property like a sentry. According to them, everyone is trespassing, no exceptions. Covering the glass so your dog doesn’t see what’s out there can add calm, peace, and quiet to many households.\nDitch the doorbell.\nDisconnect your doorbell if your dog goes wild when anyone rings it. Knocking is far less upsetting to almost all dogsthan the doorbell. If your pup is not worked up to begin with, it will be easier to teach them to sit, go to their “place,” or togo get a toywhen someone is at the door.\nKeep all the “no-no” items away from them.\nPutting secure tops on tempting containers can be a game changer in many households. A covered garbage can stop dogs from having a trash party. And a covered hamper prevents dogs fromgetting socks and underwearto grab or eat. (Thisdog who ate 24 sockscould have used a hamper with a lid!) For truly committed dogs, putting these items behind a closed door may be necessary. I suggest putting the laundry basket in a closed closet and the kitchen trash can in the garage or under the sink (if possible) to avoid problems.\nGive them some slack on the leash.\nUse a 10-to-12-foot leash on walks instead of a four-to-six-foot leash toprevent pulling. Many dogs just need a little more room to roam and don’t pull as hard with that extra line. Some will pull no matter what the length of the leash is, but for a lot of dogs, a longer leash makes walks more fun (and safer!) for everyone.\nTo find out which type of walker you have, attach two shorter leashes to double the length of their leash as a test. This way, you can figure out if a longer-leash hack will work for them. Another way to lessen pulling is to go on an out-and-back route rather than a loop. A lot of dogs don’t pull, or at least not nearly as much, when they are retracing their steps (they are less curious about somewhere they’ve already been). So, this method may get you half a walk free of pulling, which is a big improvement.\nProvide them with plenty of activities.\nGive your dog something to do so they don’t get bored and try to entertain themselves by being mischievous. Most dogs have certain times of day or certain situations when they are more likely to get into trouble. For many dogs, mischief o’clock is mid-morning or late afternoon.\nOnce you know your dog’s witching hour for naughtiness, get in the habit of giving them something to dobeforethere’s a problem. For example, give your dog astuffed Kongwhen you are making dinner so they don’t try to help themselves to your ingredients. Give them something new to chew on before your friends come over. Have pre-prepped items, like a stuffed Kong that has already been frozen in the freezer, that you can easily give your dog if you need to occupy them at the last minute for any reason.\nBlock their access to the counter to begin with.\nCounter surfing behaviorwill happen if you don’t prepare. If, the first time your dog puts their paws on the counter, they find a jackpot of food they can snack on, they will try to get up on that counter again as soon as they can.\nTo keep them from being rewarded, block access to the counter, especially while you are cooking and food is all over the place, or nobody is watching the counter. Try putting up a baby gate, put them in a pen or crate in the kitchen, ortether themso they can’t reach the counter. Another option is to open your drawersjust enoughso they can’t reach the counter. Either keep the counters clear of food completely, store food that’s on the counter in closed containers, or push the food to the back of the counter so your dog can’t reach it (unless they are so tall that that  simply won’t work).\nBottom line: Control the environment so you don’t have to work so hard to control your dog.\nAlmost everyone with a dog is dealing with some kind of behavior they don’t like. But you don’t always have tohire a behavioristto work on all of these things. Try some of the above ideas and see how much better things get. Then you can narrow in on a training plan for any issues that remain. This way, life is easier for everyone.\nFor more tips on managing your dog’s behavior, check out Juliana DeWillems’snew bookManage It!: Hacks for Improving Your Dog’s Behavior.",

Bringing a dog into your life and home can be filled with love and joy. But it is alsofilled with responsibilities,bills, and sometimes difficult decisions. Adopting a rescue dog can pose many difficulties, mostly because of their unknown past. Although theremay be challenges, you can triumph over them, and in the end, if you are willing to put in the work, you can end up with a great success story.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHow to train a rescue dog\nOver the last few weeks, I have been working with Stefanie and her newly adopted dog, Esme. Stefanie is very excited and happy to have her new dog, but she’s also highly overwhelmed. We have been working together to make this experience easier for both mom and pup. Esme is afraid of everything: loud noises, cars driving past, other dogs, and more. Moving to the city has been a hard adjustment for little Esme. When outside, Esme will just pancake her body to the ground when something scary goes by, and Stefanie can’t get her tocontinue to walk.\nWhen bringing a rescue dog like Esme home, it is best tofocus on your bondfirst (this will be key to helping them come out of their shell). You can work on basic cues like ”sit,” ”down,” and ”stay” in the future. Creating a bond with your pup will help them feel safe and secure in their environment. Taking your time, being patient and consistent will be key. Moving at their pace will help build a safe and secure bond. This will be an important step to integrate them into your life and help them become a wonderful dog.Crate-training,potty-training,and recallcan be some of your most important first skills for your rescue dog.\nBoundaries, right? But if they end up sleeping in bed, that’s cool, too.\nHouse-training a rescue dog\nYou should start potty-training and crate-training immediately when bringing your rescue home. Prepare to have the crate ready, before bringing your dog home, and be sure to have a plan on how to potty-train. This will set you and your dog up for success from the start.\nCrating a dog is one of the best things you can do for your new friend. There are so many benefits that come from crate-training. To start, crate-training gives you a safe space to keep your dog while getting to know them. If you build a positive relationship with the crate, your dog will feel safe in and comfortable with it. Byusing positive reinforcementto crate-train, your dog will learn that the crate is a space to go when they are feeling unsafe or want to take a nap or relax away from something that is bothering them. Crate-training will also help with potty training your new dog.\nPut your crate in an area where you like to relax. When beginning the process, don’t just put your dog in the crate and leave. This will set the crate up to become something negative for them. They will begin to learn that you leave every time they are placed in the crate and start to hate it. Instead, begin by feeding your dog all of their meals in their crate while you hang out close by. And if you are having a hard time getting your dog to even step foot in the crate, you will have to start with smaller steps.\nBegin by tossing a yummy treat toward the crate entrance, allowing your dog to get the treat. As they get more and more comfortable, you can toss the treats further and further into the crate. Working on getting more of their body into the crate as they get comfortable. Once they get their full body into the crate, throw them a treat party! Toss a bunch of treats inside for them to get. As your dog gets more comfortable with going into the crate while the door stays open, you can begin to close the door for short periods at a time.\nWhile you are relaxing nearby, close the crate for two to three minutes, then open it and let them out. Continue increasing the time as your dog gets more comfortable. If your dog is barking or scratching to get out, pause a few seconds before releasing them from the crate. Try your best to not let them out while they are barking or scratching. Once your dog is comfortable with being in the crate while you are in the room, you can leave them in the crate and walk out of the room for brief bursts of time. When you return, leave them in the crate, wait until they are calm and relaxed before letting them out.\nThe best way to start potty training to set a schedule and use timers. Begin by taking your dog out every 15 minutes and be sure to reward them as soon as they finish. When taking them out, you should always take them to the same area to potty. You do not want to take them on a walk to potty. Find a place right outside of the exit of your home that can be the designated potty area. By creating a designated area, you will have a dog who goes pee or poop right when they get to the special spot.\nIf you take your dog for a walk to do their business, this will create a habit. Your dog will want tofind the best spot to go, which can cause them to take a long time. But when starting potty training, it is important to follow your schedule. On top of your schedule, be sure to take them out right after they wake up, eat, or play. This will help prevent many accidents.  One key to potty-training is the crate; if you can not watch your dog, put them in the crate. Most pups will not pee or poop in the same cozy area where they sleep. Be sure to take them outside as soon as you let them out of their crate.\nHow to train a dog in basic cues\n“Stay” is a great way to teach your dog impulse control, safety, and better behavior. Overall, a dog with good impulse control will be a better-behaved dog. Impulse control teaches your dog to wait before acting on something they want, helping them learn self-control. This can protect them, too, since it can prevent your dog from running into the street when trying to cross or running out the front door when letting guests in.\nHelping your dog learn to respond to cues you ask them to do helps build a well-rounded dog. “Sit” is a great starter behavior since it is the foundation of many cues. It can be used as impulse control because when you ask your dog to sit, it brings their attention to you, which may help them slow down and prevent them from rushing someone. “Sit” is helpful to keep your dog calm in situations where they may jump on someone inappropriately. Overall, “sit” is an easy behavior to train that will lay the ground work for future training and positive interactions with others.\n“Drop it”can be a life-saving cue, if taught reliably. Not only is “drop it” a handy trick for your dog to know when you are playing games like fetch, “drop it” can help you get your dog to let go of something dangerous and prevent them from ingesting it.\nRecall is another skill that could save your dog’s life. I like to train my dog in two types of recall: a response to their name and an emergency recall. Both are extremely helpful to build a well trained dog.\nRecall is when your dog responds to their name when they are called. When they hear their name, they look up at you or come. An emergency recall is taught just for that, an emergency. In this case, you will use a low, loud, and serious voice to say a word you don’t usually use with them. This can be anything, like “Fishsticks!” as long as it knows you mean business and to come immediately. This recall word is one you hope you never have to use. You might use an emergency recall, for example, when your dog is about to chase after a deer and run into the road. Both types of recalls are very important to have a well-rounded dog that you can count on.\nEstablish a firm routine and boundaries\nEstablishing routines and setting clear boundaries for your dog is a great way to help your dog feel comfortable and safe. Similar to how people thrive off routines and knowing what is expected of them, dogs also appreciate routines. Using a positive approach to showing your dog boundaries and what is expected of them will help your dog thrive. To set boundaries with your dog you can, for example: train them not to go through a threshold without being released or to not jump on the bed or couch unless invited. By training your dog with positive reinforcement, you will teach them what is right and reward them for those actions. By rewarding your dog for what you are looking for first, you will avoid problematic behavior before it starts.\nTeach your pup a perfect recall so you can be sure they will come back, no matter what.\nConsider an obedience class\nTaking your new dog to a positive-reinforcement training class is a great way to set you and your dog up for success.Training classesare not just for your pup — classes also teachyouthe best way to handle a situation. Training classes scaffold certain behaviors and teach them in a manageable way. Each week, you will work on certain behaviors in class, and then have a week to practice them until you head to your next class.\nIf you have any difficulty training your dog while you are home, you have access to the trainer. You can ask them questions when you return to class to help you better understand how to train that behavior and help your dog succeed. Training classes will teach you the best ways to reward your dog and how and why timing is key when feeding your dog treats after they do something you asked. Training class will help you pair treats with your love and affection so you learn how to properly reward your dog to get the best out of our training. The class will also help you learn how to fade out treats so that your dog does not become dependent on them That way, they enjoy being rewarded by your love and affection also. Classes are a lot of fun! They help you build a great bond with your dog, which is extremely important with rescue dogs.\nTraining a rescue dog can be harder than your typical dog adopted from a breeder, but it is well worth it. With your time, patience, and love your rescue dog will blossom. Not only will you know that you built a companion for life, you will also know that you saved your dog from hardships or even euthanasia.\nBottom line\nTraining a rescue dog may seem intimidating at first, but working on a few basic cues is easier than you might think. By using a crate and emphasizing the importance of a routine and boundaries, you’ll get your rescue dog sitting and staying in no time. And if all else fails: There’s always the option of an obedience class.\nReferences\n“5 Tips for Successful Dog Training.”Vetmed.vt.edu,vetmed.vt.edu/news/2023/dog-training-tips.html.\n“5 Tips for Successful Dog Training.”Vetmed.vt.edu,vetmed.vt.edu/news/2023/dog-training-tips.html.\n“Crate Training | Indoor Pet Initiative.”Osu.edu, 2025,indoorpet.osu.edu/dogs/puppy/crate-training.

    "page_content": "Puppies have so much to learn, and we have so much to teach them: “Keep your mouth busywith this Kongbut not with my shoe.” “Pee herebut not there.” “Play with this tug toy but not your blanket.” And the list goes on.\nAnything that makes it easier for them to learn all the basics of life in the human world is a gift to us all. One strategy (with so much unused potential) is tethering, and teaching your puppy to be comfortable with it will pay dividends later. Tethering is just what it sounds like: attaching your dog with apup-approved cablewith plenty of length to something sturdy like a heavy chair or table, piano, or couch leg. This is not usually done with an outdoor leash. Many dogs will chew through a leash, so unless your dog is never the sort to do so, use a cable that prevents that behavior. (Regular leashes can be used short-term in an emergency, but it’s not Plan A, only Plan B.)To tether your pup, make a loop with the cable around the leg of a table, chair, couch, or something sturdy. Then, thread the end with the attachment hook through the small loop on the other end. Next, attach the hook part of the cord to your pup’s harness (more on why you should use a harness later). This will secure the cord while still giving your pup enough slack to move around within their designated area.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nWhy is tethering useful?\nWhen tethered, puppies are limited in how far they can move from the spot where their cable is attached. Tethering is a useful training and management tool. As a short-term method of controlling your dog indoors, it is incredibly practical. Tethering is a great way to help many puppies settle down, to get some peace and quiet, and to minimize issues with possessiveness between dogs.\nTeach your dog to like their tether, and you will be able to use this technique for everyone’s benefit throughout their life. If a puppy has been happy while tethered, they can be happy as an adult, should it be necessary or useful to keep them in one spot for any reason.\nYou might tether if you are taking your dog to the home of someone who isn’t super into pups. Or you may use the technique if, for example, you have 16 fourth graders over to decorate cupcakes, and you don’t want your dog getting in on the party. Generally, dogs who are tethered as puppies are less likely to develop bad habits and may not need to be tethered much as adults, but the option is always there if needed.\nUnless they are tired enough to sleep or at least rest while they are hooked up to the cord, give them something to do byproviding a stuffed Kongor anothersafe chew toy. Tethering is helpful for encouraging your dog to act as you would like and preventing them from acting in ways you don’t like in many situations. Here are a few:\nTethering can help you train your puppy to do what you want and helps prevent unwanted conduct. For example, a puppy who is tethered can’t jump up on visitors who are out of reach. Giving your puppy a chance to calm down before any visitors come over also decreases the chances thatthey will jump on anyone. When a puppy is encouraged to do the right thing, you can reinforce that behavior, making it even more likely to happen in the future.\nBoredom is theenemy of good behavior, and a bored puppy is likely to go looking for things to do. When a puppy is on their tether, they can’t wander around, so it’s easier to prevent them from stealing items or from chewing on things they shouldn’t. You can easily clear the small area they’re in of anything they shouldn’t have, and offer them something to chew on to keep them occupied. Tethering helpsprevent dogs from chewingon shoes, blankets, books, and anything else you want to protect from their teeth.\nOne of the challenges of life with a puppy is trying to get through your to-do list without interruptions. Puppies are generally less than helpful when you try to do yoga, assemble furniture, make art, or use your floor space in any other way. Tethering allows everyone to do their thing without being bothered. If you aren’t able to, just make sure that someone is watching your tethered pup while you have your much-deserved “you” time.\nIt is easier to prevent the common house training problem of the puppyrunning off to pottyout of sight of everyone. They still need to betaken out frequently; tethering them won’t prevent accidents in general.\nAnother benefit of tethering a dog is to prevent them from getting into snacks or other yummy things they shouldn’t have. This could mean human food on the table or counter (especially if theytend to counter surfduring food-prep time). Or, if you have more than one pet in the house and you want to prevent food aggression, tethering your puppy will keep them away from the other animals while they chow down.\nSometimes, it helps to tether dogs who struggle to be in the same space. For example, you could tether one dog to the far end of the couch and the other to the piano on the opposite side of the room so there is plenty of space between them. Each dog can have theirown treat to chew on; this way, no one is trying to help themselves to what the other dog has. This only works with pups who are comfortable being in sight of one another and in the same room at all.\nDon’t let your new dogwalk you.\nMake tethering a positive experience for your dog.\nTo make that happen, tether your puppy in a comfortable spot. Let them have a blanket orbed to rest on. Use a spot where they are not in the way of people moving around your house so they can relax and not be stepped over or bumped into. In general, I recommend that you prevent other animals in the house from approaching them while they are tethered. Because they have a limited range of motion while in this position, it’s not fair to them if another dog or cat tries to entice them to interact or play.\nStart with very short sessions of just a couple of minutes and begin by sitting down with your puppy and keeping them company. Don’t sit with them the whole time, but remain near, where you can see them. Gradually work up to tethering your dog for 10 to 30 minutes. It’s not meant to be a lengthy experience.\nKeep your tethered dog safe.\nTethering keeps your dog in one spot, and that can help keep them safe. However, tethering comes with its own safety concerns. It’s no good if the dog gets tangled up in the cord or becomes upset. That’s why rule one is that any pup on a tether needs to have eyes on themat all times. A dog who is not being watched can get twisted up in the tether — a problem that can be dangerous and scary, and even cause an injury.\nOther guidelines are to attach the tether to something too heavy for them to move. For a little dog, that may be a 20-pound weight. For a large dog, that may mean wrapping the tether around the leg of a piano or some other heavy piece of furniture. Using eye bolts properly attached to the walls of your home and using that to anchor the tether is another good option, as areproducts specifically designed for tethering. On the dog end of the tether, attaching the cable to a harness (rather than a collar) is safer, because there is no chance of any force accidentally being applied to the neck that way.\nTethering is not a punishment.\nTethering doesnotmean you tie your dog up when you leave the house. You should not put your dog outside where they are unprotected from whomever seeks to approach them. A tethered dog must always be supervised to prevent them from getting tangled in the line. It’s not a way to reprimand them and should never be used as such. I don’t believe punishment is a good way to treat any dog ever, and in accordance with that approach, I only use tethering to create positive experiences for dogs.\nTethering can be a wonderful way to keep dogs safe and everyone in the household happy. However, not every dog tolerates it well. If your dog is still upset, even after introducing the tether gradually and making every effort to make it a positive experience,don’tdo it. Some dogs panic when restrained or otherwise object to being tethered. No technique is right for every dog, and that’s OK.",

    "page_content": "A friend of mine recently adopted a dog from her local shelter. The dog was brought in from Los Angelesduring the fires, and the people at the shelter named him Mr. Forsythe, which, if you ask me, is afabulousdog name. Shelters often give animalsstrange namesto get the attention of prospective adopters, and in this case, it definitely worked. My friend loves the name Mr. Forsythe. Unfortunately, her pup does not appear to share her enthusiasm. He doesn’t really respond when she uses it, anyway.\nThis could be becausehe had another namebefore he made his way into the shelter system. Or it could simply be that he doesn’t like it. In either case, my friend is loath to change it because she says she doesn’t want to confuse him. But I’m not so sure. If your dog isn’t responding to their name, why not change it?\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\n“I think it’s a great idea,” says dog behavior expert and celebrity dog trainer Jessica Jacobson ofDapper Dog Trainingin New York City. “Why stick with a name your dog doesn’t like? It’s just going to make getting their attention and training them that much harder.”\nHow to let your dog pick their own name\nFirst, you want to come up with a list of names you find acceptable. “Choose names you want to say out loud,” Jacobson says. “Names you wouldn’t mind yelling in public.” After all, if you’re at the park and you have to get your dog’s attention or if they run away and you have to go looking for them, you might not want to shout “Snuggles” or “Kisses” or “Satan” at the top of your lungs. Or maybe you would. I don’t know. You do you. I’m not here to yuck your yum.\nThat said, Jacobson does advise that you avoid names that sound like cues the dog might learn over the course of their training — “Flip,” for instance, sounds like “Sit,” especially to a dog, while “May” sounds like “Stay” and “Rover,” honestly, sounds a lot like “Roll over.” Can your dog learn the difference between “Rover” and “Roll over?” Probably, but why make training any harder or more confusing than it needs to be?\nJacobson also advises staying away from naming them after foods, like “Chicken,” because you are likely to say it within earshot of your dog even when not actually referring to them and that could make them less likely to respond to it when you are. Also, if your dog is food-motivated, as many are, the word “chicken” might be too stimulating and mention of thathigh-value treatmay make it harder for them to focus during training.\nOnce you’ve made your list, try saying the names to your dog and see which ones they respond to. Do this when the dog is resting, perhaps when they are turned away from you, not really paying attention, or particularly concerned about what you’re doing. Then go through your list and try each name a few times. If your dog is unmoved by what you call them, cross it off the list. If they get up and leave the room,reallycross that option off the list, and then give them a break and pick up thename gameagain a little later.\nYou want to try to find a name that makes your dog perk up and take notice. Ideally, it should be one that makes them actually turn around and look at you or even approach you when they hear it.\nWhat about nicknames?\nOf course, just because you name your dog one thing doesn’t mean that’s the only thing you’ll call them. Nicknames are one of the ways we express affection for our pets. And sometimes, weend up using those nicknameseven more than their real names, especially if their real ones are too long, or we don’t really like saying them. I mean, I had a cat called Yoshi that I called “Bunny” at least half the time just because I preferred that. I also called him “Bunny Whistle,” “Bun Bun,” “Yooshi,” and “Little Conductor.” And my other cat, Pumpkin, was just as likely to be called “Pumpy” or “Pumpers” as he was Pumpkin.\nThen again, I didn’t choose either of those cats’ names. That’s what they were called at the shelter. Maybe if Ihadcome up with their names, I would have been less likely to rely so heavily on random replacements. And who knows — maybe if I just called them Yoshi and Pumpkin consistently, they would have been more responsive to those words. I’ll have to try that next time I adopt and get back to you.\n“In terms of responsiveness, I don’t think it helps to have too many nicknames,” Jacobson says. After all, if you have a million different names for your dog; they might not realize when you are actually talking to them or need their attention. “That said,” she adds, “I do think dogs are capable of learning these names and determining your mood based on which name you use.”\nThe danger there is that you don’t want to get to a place where you only use your dog’s full government name when you are upset with them or ask them to do something they don’t want to do. If your dog starts to associate their own name with negative experiences or outcomes, they will likely become less responsive to it overall.\nAnd the whole point of letting them choose their own name in the first place is that you want them to bemoreresponsive to it, not less. You want your dog to hear you call for them and come running. So, make it easy for them and make sure you’re shouting out a moniker that has their paw-stamp of approval.",

This often evokes heartwarming experiences, like taking your dog on fun adventures and having snuggles on the couch. But as intense as the concept of training your dog may initially seem, this is actually one of the best ways to bond with your pup.\nAgility training, which can be implementedat a young age, is a skilled step up fromobedience training, and involves engaging your dog’s body, mind, and spirit through obstacle-type courses. As a bonus: They burn off all that excess energy (which can lead to undesirable behavior), interact meaningfully with you, and will dazzle folks with all the cool tricks they’re learning. After all, at the end of the day, what these loving creatures really want is their human’s undivided attention.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nGetting you and your dog into agility training is a relatively easy thing. It just requires a bit of makeshift equipment at home (think boxes and cushions), as well as a lot of patience and persistence. Read on for everything you need to know about how to build a strong bond with your dog by getting into agility training.\nDog agility training: getting started\n“Buddy and I were watching theWestminster Dog Show, and I really think I want to get into it with him. He is a little slow and nervous — I wonder how he would do? I’ve heard it can help with their confidence. I think that would be great for him.”\nAs a trainer, I often hear something like this from clients. People who have never tried agility training with their pups are inspired by competitions they see on TV, and they want to give it a try with their dog. You don’t have to go all the way to Westminster or even get serious with agility. It can just be a fun way to engage with your dog. Any dog, no matter their shape or size, can do agility.\nBefore getting started on agility, it helps to acquaint your pup with somefundamental obedience training, so they get used to the concept of positive reinforcement. Then, when you’re ready to move on to agility at home, you can use what you have around you to teach them the agility basics. Below, a lot more details on how that works.\nThe answer to your obedience questions—right there on your phone.\nAt-home agility training for dogs\nAgility workson many of your dog’s different skill sets: honingoff-leash skills, approaching various obstacles, and taking directional cues. Practicing agility can greatly improve the relationship between you and your dog. Agility builds a connection with your dog, which helps them better understand you and your cues.\nIf you have a shy or nervous dog, agility can help bring them out of their shell and show them that the world isn’t a scary place. If you have any concerns about your dog’s ability or exercise level, you should check with your veterinarian to make sure they are healthy enough to do agility.\nIf you are looking to doagility for fun at home, you can work with what you have for some of the skills. However, if you are working towards competition, you will need to invest in equipment or find a facility to help your dog build those skills.\nAgility can be like a foreign language to a new dog parent: You will be introduced to obstacle cues, directional cues, and skill cues.When starting agility, it is helpful to have prior,basic trainingwith your dog. (In fact, many agility schools will require that your dog passes a basic-training class and understand cues such as “sit,” “down,” “stay,” and “come.”) Your dog doesn’t have to be perfect when you first start, but the more fluent they are with these basic behaviors, the easier things will be. Some behaviors thatyour dog will learnthrough agility are left and right turns, the dog walk, tunnel, table, A-frame, seesaw, different types of jumps, and weave poles.\nWorking on flexibility with your dog is important when doing agility. Asking your vet for ways to help your dog stretch can keep your dog in tip-top shape and free of any injuries that may come from the basic wear and tear of agility. Just like a human should stretch before and after physical activity, your dog should do the same. There is a lot of movement in agility that your dog may not be used to doing in everyday life, and stretching will help keep them flexible.\nTunnel training — or, running through a tunnel — can be scary for your dog. Tunnels are not always in straight lines and may curve, which will make it difficult for your dog to see the exit. You can start slowly training this activity at home by using a box and treats.\nHere’s how.\nPick a box that opens at the top and bottom, and affix the flaps so they stay open. Make sure that your dog can comfortably walk through it.\nPick a box that opens at the top and bottom, and affix the flaps so they stay open.

(The prices range from medium to high.) You’d start by expanding the tunnel by a few feet, then gradually extending it over time as your dog becomes more comfortable in it. Once it is completely extended, you can make the training harder by bending it slightly to create a curve.\nAgility teaches your dog impulse control and directional cues; it builds your relationship working as a team. Over time, your dog will want to engage more with you, and their attention towards you will improve. They will learn how to respond to your slightest movements and interpret your body language.\nLook to your environment forfun thingsyour dog can jump over. It’s best to start with an object that is about five inches off the ground.\nToss a treat onto the other side of the item you want them to jump over. Your dog should follow the treat. Do that a few times. If your dog walks around the object, you may need to lower the item or block the sides — so the only way they can reach the treat is by going over the object and not around it.\nToss a treat onto the other side of the item you want them to jump over.

Always err on the side of caution to keep your dog safe. Age, breed, and prior health issues will determine how high or often your dog should jump.\nTo learn agility, a dog will need body awareness, or that their front legs and back legs can move separately. This does not typically come naturally to them, but you can teach this awareness byslowly encouraging themto touch a target with each of their paws.\nCut an eight-to-10-inch circle of cardboard and paint it yellow.

Tricks are also a way for your dog to gain confidence, which is a major part of agility. Some go-to tricks to start with include touching something, jumping through a hula-hoop, and jumping over obstacles.\nThe seesaw is one of the scariest pieces of agility equipment for certain dogs. The dog has to step on one side of the seesaw, then begin to walk across to the other side. As they get over the middle hump, it will start to go downward. In practice, this should be taken very slowly, because as your dog adds speed, the seesaw will come crashing down, hard and fast. If your dog gets scared, they could fall off and hurt themselves.\nFind objects within your home that are unstable, but safe for your dog to walk on.

If you practice at home, you will want to get equipment as your dog gets better at agility training. There are several online tutorials explaining how to build your own equipment — most obstacles can be made with PVC or wood. You can also purchase the different obstacles in smaller versions for your backyard.\nIf you and your pup get hooked on at-home agility, you may want to build both of your skills by joining a class. This is also a great way to prepare for competing, if that interests you. Either way, agility training is so much better when done in a class setting, where a trainer can teach you the foundations of agility and its safest practices. Some facilities even allow you to rent their space and use their equipment for training.\nBottom line\nAgility is all about fun, and a great way to build your dog’s confidence, attention span, flexibility, and conditioning. It is also a great way to increase your bond with your dog, so you can both become a better team.\nReferences\n“5 Tips for Successful Dog Training.”Vetmed.vt.edu,vetmed.vt.edu/news/2023/dog-training-tips.html.\n“5 Tips for Successful Dog Training.”Vetmed.vt.edu,vetmed.vt.edu/news/2023/dog-training-tips.html.\nDziak, Kelly. “Ideas for Training Your Dog at Home – 4-H Animal Science Resource Blog.”Rutgers.edu, 15 Apr. 2020,4hanimalscience.rutgers.edu/2020/04/15/ideas-for-training-your-dog-at-home.\nDziak, Kelly. “Ideas for Training Your Dog at Home – 4-H Animal Science Resource Blog.”Rutgers.edu, 15 Apr. 2020,4hanimalscience.rutgers.edu/2020/04/15/ideas-for-training-your-dog-at-home.\nInkilä, Leena, et al. “Part I of Finnish Agility Dog Survey: Training and Management of Competition-Level Agility Dogs.” Animals, vol. 12, no. 2, 17 Jan. 2022, p. 212,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani12020212.\nInkilä, Leena, et al. “Part I of Finnish Agility Dog Survey: Training and Management of Competition-Level Agility Dogs.” Animals, vol. 12, no. 2, 17 Jan. 2022, p. 212,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani12020212.",

Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nSo, now that I’ve had some people course-correct me on a couple of things in my life, I felt maybe I should do the same for dog parents. Here are seven lies that are often shared about dog behavior.\nYou should reach your hand out when meeting a dog for the first time.\nIt’s not a good idea to advise people that this is the perfect way to act around any dog. If you do this to a friendly, sociable dog, they will likely sniff you and happily move on to the next stage of getting to know you. But reaching your hand out to greet a pup is a great way to upset them — and possibly get a bite to the hand (or worse).Showing your hand to afearful dogwill probably make them more afraid. It’s threatening and unpleasant for them and can make their fear of people worse. Even more alarming: Most dogs who are aggressive act this way because they are afraid. Do not give a dog a reason to bite your hand.\nThe best thing you can do when meeting a dog is to let them approach you. Stand still (not rigidly—stay relaxed!) with your arms at your side, then turn a little to the side with your weight shifted to the leg further away from the dog. If the dog comes up to you, great! If they don't, let them be. If they do choose to come, it is much more likely to be a safe and enjoyable experience for all when you pet them.\nDog's like when you pet them on the top of the head.\nSure, many dogs tolerate it without doing anything, but they still probably are not really into it. Don’t believe me? Watch people with their dogs, and notice how often pups try to get away or dodge the hand reaching over their head to pet it.\nMost dogs will politely let you know that they are not enjoying it, but it’s a good idea for humans to cut it out and pet dogs where they enjoy it. Most oftenthey enjoy petson the chest, behind the ears, or on the back at the base of the tail.\nYou can see the guilt on your dog’s face.\nSo many people say their dog acts guilty in certain situations — when they come home and see missing food or a wrapper on the floor. But we know from scientific research that pups maylookshameful, but that isn’t necessarilywhat they are feeling.\nIn a2015 study, researchers looked at nearly 100 dogs and their people; the pet parents were instructed to forbid their dog from eating a piece of ham and then leave the room. Then an experimenter either picked up the ham or left it for the dog to eat. The returning pet parent had no way of knowing whether their dog ate the ham. And per the study, they could not tell, based on their dog’s expression, whether they felt guilty.\nDogs are acting “guilty” when their people scold them, not when they have eaten something they shouldn’t. The guilty look is an attempt to appease their people and has nothing to do with their behavior.\nA tail wag always means a dog is friendly.\nSadly, it is not this simple. The most accurateinterpretation of a tail wagisnotthat the dog is friendly, but that the they are willing to interact. Friendly dogs are certainly willing to interact, and they wag their tails. But there are unfriendly ways of interacting, and dogs with these intentions also wag their tails. The details of the tail wag can tell you more about whether it’s is a friendly one.\nIf your dog’s full body (or at least their whole backside) is moving while they wag their tail, they are more likely to be friendly. The same is true if the pup’s tail moves fast, while remaining fluid and flexible. If the tail rotates in a circle starting at the base, this is also a sign of friendliness. In contrast, if you see a pup do a slow, stiff tail wag — perhaps only the tip of the tail is wagging — this is a warning, especially if the rest of their body is also stiff. These days, more people know that a wagging tail does not always equal a friendly dog. But I still regularly have clients who say, “I can’t believe they bit someone; they were wagging their tail!”\nYou can’t teach an old dog new tricks.\nHappily, this is not true at all. Dogs remain flexible in their behavior throughout their lives and can always learn new skills. There isnoage limit on training a dog, and many pups continue to learndeep into their golden years.\nWhile age itself does not interfere with dogs learning something new, conditions that are often associated with aging may be a problem. If a dog is old enough to haveorthopedic issues, for example, they may resist certain actions because they are painful for them. Similarly, if they experiencesevere cognitive decline, they will struggle to learn. Otherwise, they can be excellent students no matter how gray their muzzles are.\nYou don’t need to walk your dog if they are out in the yard a lot.\nIt’s a mistake to assume your dog is running around and getting the exercise they need when alone in the yard. Dogs just don’t tend to do that. They might run a little along the fence or race out into the yard when you first open the door, but mostly they lie around orwalk slowly and sniff.\nDogs don’t tend to exercise themselves. Also, part of what a walk provides (for dogs who can handle them and benefit from them) isenrichment in the formof stimulating sights, sounds, smells, and social encounters. Your dog misses these benefits if they are not given theopportunity to explorebeyond their own fences.\nTheir poor behavior is your fault.\nThis lie has caused so much pain to many good people who have dogs with less-than-ideal behavior.Of coursehow we raise our dogs influences who they become and how they behave, but it’s not the only thing that does.\nTheir genetics are hugely influential. They may be naturally shy, tend to be afraid of anything new, react strongly to loud noises, or have such a high energy level that giving them adequate exercise is a Sisyphean task. Also, we can’t control everything that happens to them, and one traumatic incident out of our control can derail a lot of dogs, no matter how skillfully we train them.\nAnother issue is their health. If a dog suffers from a bad health incident, that can have a big influence on them, especially if it happens at a young age, and they miss out on some important experiences. This lie, sometimes alternatively phrased as, “there are no bad dogs, only bad people,” is so prevalent that it’s one of the most common comments I hear from people when they learn what I do for a living. I find myself constantly telling people that many of my clients have raised two, five, eight, or even 11 dogs. But they are only calling me about one of these dogs, which tells me it isn’t about them.\nReferences\nOstojić, Ljerka, et al. “Are Owners’ Reports of Their Dogs’ “Guilty Look” Influenced by the Dogs’ Action and Evidence of the Misdeed?”Behavioural Processes, vol. 111, Feb. 2015, pp. 97–100,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2014.12.010.\nOstojić, Ljerka, et al. “Are Owners’ Reports of Their Dogs’ “Guilty Look” Influenced by the Dogs’ Action and Evidence of the Misdeed?”Behavioural Processes, vol. 111, Feb. 2015, pp. 97–100,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2014.12.010.",

    "page_content": "Sunday, March 9 is daylight savings time. While that means we are awake for another hour of sunlight after a dark winter (yay!), it also means losing an hour of sleep — boo. Not everyone will change their clocks, though. While most of the country observes this ritual, in Arizona, only people who live on the Navajo Nation change their clocks, and those in Hawaii and Puerto Rico get to keep their sleep.\nBut if you are in that majority and also happen to be a pet parent, it’s a good idea to prepare yourself for this semi-annual annoyance. Daylight saving time is an outdated and unhealthy human construct, and many animals are having no part of it. Dogs and cats follow their circadian rhythms.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nWhat is circadian rhythm?\nPets are inclined to be active at certain times of the day just as birds are inclined to sing at sunrise and coyotes tend to howl during the night. The tendency to behave in certain ways over the course of the day is part of the daily cycle called a circadian rhythm.\nThese internal clocks override our rigid time schedules, so many dogs (and many more cats) will probably get up at their usual time, regardless of what the clock says, to start their day.\nThe light/dark cycle of our rotating planet is responsible for the circadian rhythms that lead to the predictable timing of behaviors throughout the day. Light leads to changes in the hypothalamus, which regulates these daily rhythms. The pattern of light affects sleep cycles, hormone levels, brain wave activity and body temperature, all of which have an impact on behavior.\nDogs need more sleep than humans. Here’s how much is healthy.\nHelping your pet adjust to the time change\nWhen the time shifts, pets are generally confused, and we have no way to explain this to them. Here are a couple of ways you can help your dog or cat adapt:\nIt’s typical for pets to need a couple of days to adjust after the time change, but some take longer than others. Pets with a strong internal clock are heavily influenced by sunrise, sunset, and predictable feelings of hunger. As those cues still happen, pets who respond to them tend to struggle with the new schedule.\nSome dogs are also highly schedule-oriented, but they respond to human cues — the alarm clock, people getting out of bed, the sound of food being put in the bowl — and they are often able to adapt more quickly to the wackiness of humans messing around with clocks.\nIt can be helpful to meet pets in the middle as they adjust to the time change. It may be easier if you can break up the hour difference and only adjust their schedule —walks,feeding time, bedtime and waking up — by 15 to 30 minutes each day. If your schedule does not allow that kind of flexibility or you find that your dog gets in line with the new daily rhythm within a few days anyway, it may not be worth the extra effort. But, for the rare dog who struggles for a long time with the time change, breaking up the hour into smaller pieces for a more gradual adjustment can be a great kindness.\nIt can be tough for some pets (and let’s be real, for some people too) to adapt, so build in room for an adjustment period. Giving them a few extra minutes to take care of business might be all it takes to get them acclimated to the abrupt change in schedule.",

    "page_content": "Have you ever called your dog’s name, only to be met with a blank stare — or worse, their tail disappearing around the corner as they completely ignore you? Don’t take it personally. Unlike humans, dogs don’t instinctively understand that the sounds you repeat are meant to identify them.\nIn a dog’s world, names are another noise until they’re trained to associate them with things. The good news is that teaching your dog their name is one of the easiest, most rewarding things you can do, and with the right approach, they’ll learn and respond quickly.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nUnderstanding the importance of a dog’s name\nYour dog’s name is more than an adorable identifier — it’s a crucial communication element. The verbal cue signals to your dog that you need their attention, whether calling them inside, redirecting behavior, or looking for an affectionate response. A dog who reliably recognizes their name is more straightforward to train and safer in everyday situations, especially in public.\nName recognition builds the foundation of your bond. Dogs associate learning with positive things like treats, belly rubs, and praise. Good things equal good feelings and positive behavior. Ergo, knowing their name strengthens their trust, making other forms of training easier later. Getting your dog to respond to their name is vital for effective connection, communication, and safety.\nAre you a part of the pack or doing your own thing?\nChoosing the right name\nBefore diving into training, choose a name that sets your dog up for success. While you can technically name your dog anything (looking at you, folks who call their pup “Sir Barkington”), some names are more effective than others.\nKeep it short and straightforward.One to two syllables work best (Max, Luna, Bella, or Duke).\nKeep it short and straightforward.One to two syllables work best (Max, Luna, Bella, or Duke).\nAvoid names that sound like common commands.Naming your dog “Kit” may confuse your pup when you say “Sit.”\nAvoid names that sound like common commands.Naming your dog “Kit” may confuse your pup when you say “Sit.”\nChoose something easy to say and recognize.Dogs respond better to sharp, distinct sounds over long, drawn-out names.\nChoose something easy to say and recognize.Dogs respond better to sharp, distinct sounds over long, drawn-out names.\nMake sure the name has a positive association.If you’re renaming a rescue dog, pick something fresh that doesn’t carry past baggage.\nMake sure the name has a positive association.If you’re renaming a rescue dog, pick something fresh that doesn’t carry past baggage.\nHow to teach a dog their name\nTraining works best when your dog feels relaxed and happy. Start in a quiet, distraction-free area where your dog can focus on you. Your dog may be less receptive if they’re overexcited, hungry, or tired. Find a time when your dog is alert but calm to make learning enjoyable.\nDogs learn through positive reinforcement, which means the fastest way to get them to respond to their name is by making it rewarding. Say your dog’s name in a cheerful tone. When they look at you, reward them with a treat and praise. Repeat several times, ensuring they consistently associate hearing their name with something positive.\nOver time, your dog will learn that responding to their name leads to good things, like treats, belly rubs, or an excited “Good dog!”\nConsistency is essential in all dog training, and name recognition is no exception. Use your dog’s name regularly, but only in a positive context. If you use their name to scold them, they may associate their name with being punished, which could lead to avoidance.\nStick to a consistently positive training pattern. Say their name only when you want their attention, reward them when they respond, and keep your tone upbeat.\nSome dogs learn name recognition quickly, while others take longer. Puppies and eager-to-please breeds (such as Golden Retrievers) may recognize their name in less than a week, whereas independent or rescue dogs may need more time. The key is repetition without frustration. If your dog seems uninterested and your patience is thin, take a break and try again later.\nChallenge their recognition once your dog reliably responds in a quiet, familiar setting. Dogs need to generalize their training, meaning they should recognize their name regardless of where they are. The goal is for your dog to respond no matter what’s happening around them.\nIndoors:Try calling your dog’s name from different rooms and distances. If they come to you, reward them. This strengthens the connection between their name and paying attention, even when they’re not right next to you.\nIndoors:Try calling your dog’s name from different rooms and distances.

His head should lift, his tail should wag, and ideally, he should move toward you.” This is crucial in preventing dangerous situations, like running toward traffic or getting into trouble at the dog park.\nCommon mistakes to avoid\nNegative use of the name:Avoid scolding your dog with their name; otherwise, they may ignore it.\nNegative use of the name:Avoid scolding your dog with their name; otherwise, they may ignore it.\nOverusing the name without rewarding:Without positive reinforcement, they may start tuning you out if you say their name constantly.\nOverusing the name without rewarding:Without positive reinforcement, they may start tuning you out if you say their name constantly.\nExpecting instant results:Some dogs need more learning time, so be patient and celebrate small successes.\nExpecting instant results:Some dogs need more learning time, so be patient and celebrate small successes.\nOnly training in one location:Dogs need to learn their name in multiple environments to ensure consistent responses.\nOnly training in one location:Dogs need to learn their name in multiple environments to ensure consistent responses.\nDon’t be surprised if you see your dog’s moniker in a book of baby names.\nWhen to consider a professional trainer\nConsult a professional if your dog consistently ignores their name (despite your best efforts). A trainer or behaviorist can assess whether underlying issues, such as hearing loss or anxiety, affect your canine’s learning abilities. Professional guidance can be helpful for rescue dogs with unknown histories or those who have developed a habit of ignoring commands.\nHow long does it take for a dog to learn their name?\nThe time frame varies, but most dogs can learn and recognize their name within a few weeks. Puppies tend to learn quicker, while older dogs or rescues need time to adjust to a new name with extra reinforcement. The key is repetition, rewards, and patience. Stay consistent; your dog will soon recognize and enthusiastically respond to their name.\nReferences\nAmerican Kennel Club. \"How to Teach Your Dog Their Name.\"AKC.org,https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/training/how-to-teach-dog-name/\nAmerican Kennel Club. \"How to Teach Your Dog Their Name.\"AKC.org,https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/training/how-to-teach-dog-name/\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Extension.The Basics of Training Your Dog.University of Wisconsin-Extension 4-H, May 2021,https://4h.extension.wisc.edu/files/2021/05/The-Basics-of-Training-Your-Dog.pdf\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Extension.The Basics of Training Your Dog.University of Wisconsin-Extension 4-H, May 2021,https://4h.extension.wisc.edu/files/2021/05/The-Basics-of-Training-Your-Dog.pdf",

      "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/dog-barks-same-way"
    },
    "page_content": "More often than not, being a dog parent means trying to decode some seriously strange behavior: Why is my dogstaring so intentlyat that empty corner in the living room? Why are theylicking their pawsso much? And why can’tthey stop humpingthat one specific friend of mine? Some mysteries are more frustrating than others — and some are loud enough that you’ll want to solve them sooner than later.\nFor instance, does your dog sometimes bark over and over again in exactly the same way? Same pitch, same intonation, same cadence? To coin a word, this behavior could be called a barkpeat. Get it? Like repeating but, you know, barking.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nSo, are they barking out the same phrase in dog-speak, like a toddler might monotonously yell, “Mom, mom, mom, mom” when asking for a snack? Does it mean something specific? To get to the bottom of the baying, I asked two experts to share everything they know about canine vocalizations.\nWhy do dogs bark the same way over and over again?\nActually, they may be repeating the same sound because they are, indeed, asking for a very specific thing; it’s likely they’re trying to communicate something important. The reasons might vary, but if your dog is barking up a symphony, it’s best to pay attention,” says Ann Allums Vest, certified professional dog trainer and owner ofAnnie The Dog Nanny.\nThat’s where context clues andbody languagecome in. Assess your dog’s posture, pitch, and surroundings to determine which kind of barking you’re hearing. That way, you can respond accordingly.\n“When we do not respond to a dog who is communicating a need or concern, the dog will continue to vocalize,” Vest says. “For example, when the doorbell rings, a dog may continue alert barking until the person goes away or until the dog decides the person at the door is not a threat.”\nSome breeds might also make specific vocalizations of their own, says Alexandra Calgut, certified behaviorist and owner ofTraining That Stays. Beagles and other Hounds, for instance, arebred to bay, letting their parents know where they are — a behavior that can seep into other aspects of daily life. “When we start to distinguish what each kind of sound may mean, we start having a better understanding of what our dogs’ needs are,” she says.\nWhy do dogs bark in the first place?\nUsually, dogs bark because they're excited, alert, bored, or demanding something. Behaviorist Tressa Fesseden-McKenziewrote for Kinshipthat “barking is one of the trickiest behaviors to decode. And that’s a problem, because it’s not only irritating; it can also be an indication that something is not quite right with your pal.” (Even if that something is just that they need your attention and love.)\nBarking doesn’t always have to be a bad thing; it’s also how ourdogs express joy. Per Vest, dogs sometimes bark at us or other dogs to initiate playtime. If your dog is already at play and letting out a few yaps, they are probably having a blast.\nHappy barking isn’t only about playtime. Sometimes, it’s about you. “You mayhave excitement barkingwhen returning home from work and your dog is super excited,” Vest says.\nDog parents know better than anyone that our precious babies can also make great alarm systems. Weird noise in the apartment hallway? They’re on it. Mailman walking down the street? Have mercy! If anything out of the ordinary is happening, they’ll let us know. Relatedly, if something scares your dog, they might bark at it as a defensive tactic.\nBoredom barkingcan startwhen a dog is left alone for long periodswith no enrichment,” Vest says. If your dog spends eight hours waiting for you to come home from work with nomid-afternoon walkor playtime, you might hear them express that frustration vocally.\nIf your dog is dying for attention, treats, or a toy, they might let you know by barking. If you deny their pleas, there’s a good chance they’ll howl even more. Trainingcan help weanthem off this behavior, but be warned: The barking might get worse before it gets better.\nWhat do different barks mean?\nStruggling to figure out what emotion your dog is trying to convey? The pitch of their barks could provide some clues. “Context is key when it comes to understanding what the different bark can mean,” Calgut says. “High-pitch barks can mean the dog is excited over the toy it’s playing with, or it’s frustrated because the toy is stuck under the couch. Deeper barks can mean the dog is uneasy. It could also mean the dog is in aprotective mood.”\nVest agrees that high-pitched barking signifies either excitement and friendliness, anxiety, or fear. Lower-pitched sounds, on the other hand, could be a warning. If you’re not sure which emotion your dog is trying to convey, a quick look at theirbody languagecan help.\n“I think by listening to a dog’s barking while also observing the dog’s body language and the situation, we can deduce what emotions the dog may be feeling,” Vest says. “I refer toAlexandra Horowitz’s bookInside of a Dogfor ascientific overviewof dog vocalizations. She studies pet dogs at her dog cognition lab at Barnard College.”\nOnce you’ve determined what feeling your dog is trying to express, you can begin looking for ways to help resolve it.\nWhat to do if your dog won’t stop barking\nOnce you’ve determined why your dog can’t stop barking, you can start coming up with solutions that address their underlying emotions. “If your dog is barking at the dooras well as whimpering, that may be a sign he needs to go out,” Calgut says. “If your dog is barking out the window at a squirrel or the mailman, the key is redirection.”\nFor alert barking, Vest suggests, a simple “thank you” might suffice. “At my house, the dogs will bark a few times when they hear the doorbell, and I have taught them that I say, ‘Thank you’ and reward them with treats, so basically they did their job of alerting me, and they can stop barking now,” Vest says. “Since I addressed the dogs’ concerns and added something good (a treat), the barking doesn’t continue over and over.”\nIf gratitude doesn’t work, you can also try removing the stimulus for alert barking by closing the curtains or mitigating outside noise.\nIf your dog ishowling with excitement, Vest suggests modeling the behavior you wish to see in your dog. If you want them to calm down, be calm yourself (they cansmell your stress,after all). Instead of yelling, “No” or “Stop,” which your dog will construe as you barking with them, sit down andstroke them calmly. Put sometreats on the groundto redirect their attention. In other words, create a soothing environment.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, boredom barking comes from a need for stimulation. In those cases, Vest says, “I address the dog’sneed for enrichment and attention.” Give them some love, pull out a toy, or find a way togive them some exercise— whatever gets your dog’s gears happily turning again.\nDemand barking, on the other hand, requires some serious patience. The best course of action is to ignore the noise, even when your dog inevitably starts barking louder. Offer occasional rewards when the barking stops for a period of time.\nAs for play barking, Vest says, “I may encourage my dog to pick up a toy, or I may gently interrupt the play session until the barking ceases and then let them resume playing.”\nWhen should I see a trainer or a vet?\nIf your dog’s behavior begins to escalate, Calgut suggests seeking help. If the barkingbecomes disruptiveto yourself or neighbors, check in with your vet to ensure there areno underlying medicaloranxiety issues. Then, you can begin looking into a rewards-based trainer who can come up with an appropriate behavior-modification plan.",

    "page_content": "We hear it all the time — a person desperately telling their dog, “No,” and then “No,” and then “No!!!!” And finally, “No,no,no,no,no!” all without having much impact on their dog’s behavior. Just telling our dogs “no” isn’t particularly effective, because dogs don’t know what it means unless they are specifically taught to understand the word. And who wants to be the pet parent saying “no” all the time anyway?\nWhat most dogs take away from people telling them “no” is that the people are upset, but that doesn’t mean the dogs have any idea why. Even if a dog figures out that it’s their behavior that is causing distress, they don’t know specifically what they did wrong. It may be absurdly obvious to you that getting into the trash is the problem, but your pup may not see it the same way and can be confused about what they did to upset you. Were they wrong for being in the kitchen? Or being near you? Or eating?\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nThere are better ways to stop your dog from doing something besides just saying, “No!” Consider these.\nTurn away.\nIf your dog isreacting to somethingon a walk for example, one way to stop the behavior is to change directions and move away from whatever is setting them off. Whether it’s another dog, a person, a lawn mower, a bike, or a scary holiday decoration, your dog is more likely to stop barking, lunging, or growling if you walk away.\nYes, they can turn their head back to look at it, but many dogs don’t, or only do so briefly.  If you turn away from your dog’s triggers repeatedly, they may become less reactive to them over time. They have learned you will get them out of any uncomfortable situation, so they will be less upset when it pops up again.\nAsk for their attention.\nIf your dog is doing something you don’t want them to do, tryasking for their attention. That may mean saying their name, or it could mean giving them a well-known cue, like, “Watch.” Once your dog’s attention is on you, it’s a whole lot less likely they will keep barking out the window, chasing the cat, digging in the trash can,chewing onthe corner of the couch, or anything you want them to stop doingright now.\nGetting their attention is key to influencing our dogs’ behavior. So to make sure they stay willing to look when you ask, be sure to reinforce themusing treatsor something else they really love.\nInitiate play.\nNothing changes the emotions of most dogs fasterthan getting the chance to play.It’sso powerfulbecause it channels the high arousal of poor behavior into acceptable behavior.\nIt is often easier to redirect the energy of a dog reacting to something than it is to calm them down.Initiating a game of tugorfetch with a dogwho is barking out the window is going to be more effective than it is to ask them to “sit” or to “go to their place.” Bonus: This method is extra fun for you and your dog!\nGive them a cue to do something that’s easy for them.\nA fundamental guiding principle of dog training is to focus on what you want a dog to do rather than telling them not to do something. With that in mind, when your dog is doing something you don’t like, instead of saying “no” think about what specific behaviors you wouldpreferthem to do instead.\nYou probably have a long list of behaviors you would prefer to the problematic one, so choose the one you think your dog is most likely to do on cue. Common easy cues are “Sit” and “Touch” but if your dog’sfavorite cueis “Shake” or “Crawl,” ask for those behaviors instead. It can be hard for them to respond to even an easy cue when they are distracted, so be sure to reward your dog with treats for doing what you have asked.\nChange their mood with a phrase that distracts them.\nA lot of things we say have an immediate impact on how our dog feels and what they do. Examples of powerful phrases are: “It’s time for dinner?”; “Let’sgo for a walk”;“Who wants to go for a ride?”; and “We’re going to go to the park.”\nIf you can say one of these phrases and follow through by doing the thing they like, they will redirect their behavior. Don’t tease your dog by saying the phrase and then doing nothing (unless it's a serious emergency — then all the rules change!). You want them to trust that when you say you will do something, you will follow through.\nBegin a “Find Your Treat” game.\nTeach your dog the game “Find Your Treat” so you can play it anytime they are doing something you want them to stop. To teach your dog to play, put a few treats on the floor and tell your dog, “Find your treat.” Do this multiple times over several days until your dog knows the phrase “Find your treat” means to start searching.\nThen, put treats down without your dog seeing you do it and say, “Find your treat.” The spots where you put the goodies can be easy at first. Work up to more difficult hiding areas so your dog doesn’t get frustrated and give up right away.\nYou can even play by telling your dog to “stay” in one room, hiding a bunch of treats in another room, releasing them from the stay, and telling them, “Find your treat.” Once your dog knows this game well, you can play it anytime to stop them from doing something you don’t like. Simply drop a handful of treats, say, “Find your treat,” and your dog will stop lunging at a stroller or pulling a sock out of the laundry to put their nose to the ground and search for treats.\nPrevent the behavior in the future.\nSometimes, the way to stop behavior you don’t like is to make sure your dog never starts the behavior in the first place. (I know, this deserves an eye roll, but I swear there’s value in the strategy.) So, if your dog always jumps up on visitors, implement a plan to make that impossible. Then, put the plan into action before people arrive. It’s a great way to stop your dog from leaping on them, and you never have to say, “No!”\nWhether you have your dog behind a gate, playing tug with you, or busy chewing on a Kong when people come over, preventing the problematic behavior is often the best way to stop it.\nTo wrap up, “no” is not effective.\nSaying “no” all the time doesn’t tell your dog whatto do; it only tells them what not to do, and they may not even be clear on exactly what you mean. It’s also not very fun for either of you. Being creative with other methods is a far better way to handle your dog’s unwelcome behavior than saying the dreaded word.",

Crate-training is a matter of willpower — mostly yours.\nSeriously, don’t let your pup’s, or your own, initial anxiety scare you away from this valuable training tool. Onceproperly crate-trained, your pup will find peace and security in having a den to call their own. Luckily, both the right training and the right crate can help ease some of this anxiety for pets and their parents. To help, we put together our top picks for puppy training crates and chatted with expert Leigh Siegfried, owner and trainer atOpportunity Barks, to learn more about the process.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nBenefits of crate-training\nThere are loads of benefits, both short-term and long-term, to crate-training your pup. “Crate-training your dog allows them to feel prepared with a familiar relaxation spot and routine,” Siegfried tells Kinship. “It’s also a way to help your dog traverse change in the long-term and deal with life events such as moving or additions of people or dogs to a home.”\nThe bottom line is that a properly crate-trained pup has the tools to take on new challenges and changes, allowing you to do the same.\nHow to choose the right crate size\nWhen it comes to crate-training, size matters. Your puppy should be able to sit, stand, and turn around freely in the crate. To achieve this, measure their length and height, and add four inches to both in order to find a crate large enough for them to be comfortable. Knowing this, dog parents might be tempted to buy a crate that will likely accommodate their puppy’s projected adult size. However, Siegfried cautions that too large a crate can hinder the training process,\n“To feel comfortable and acclimated in a crate, a dog is going to need to feel secure and safe,” Siegfried advises.\nBasically, a cavernous crate might not give your pup those cozy, den vibes that are essential to successful crate- training. And too much space gives your puppy enough room to pee or poop without having to lie down in it, which may incentivize them to do their business in their crate. That said, it’s best to pick a crate that has enough room for your pup to get comfortable, just nottoocomfortable.\nHow to choose dog-crate materials\nWhen choosing materials for your puppy’s crate, it’s best to balance your their temperament with your lifestyle. Temperament factors include things like being potty trained or being anxious or destructive.Lifestyle factorsinclude travel, work, and budget.\nFor an easy-to-clean crate that won’t break the budget, consider this classic wire option. Foldable and durable, it’s easy enough to travel with and strong enough to withstand strong chewers or (moderate) escape artists. Plus, with eight sizes to choose from, there’s an option for every kind of pup.\nIf your pup is taking to crate-training (and potty training) like a champ, consider this soft-sided crate by EliteField. Super lightweight and perfectly portable, this choice is easy to travel with in even the largest of sizes.\nHow to choose the best dog-crate feature\nToday, crates are being more thoughtfully designed than ever before, with features intended to workwithyour space, not against it. So, when choosing a crate based on its features, pet parents should think carefully about what crate will work best for the flow of their home.\nLet’s be real: Dog crates can take up a good chunk of square footage, especially in apartments or smaller spaces. Luckily, Omlet has the solution with their Fido Nook, a sleek crate/furniture combo.  Designed to blend and function with your space, the Fido Nook is fully customizable and compatible with standard 24-inch or 36-inch crates (removable wire crates can also be purchased during customization). As far as training goes, The Fido Nook creates a quiet, den-like atmosphere that is removed from the center of the home, perfect for crate-training lessons.\nSustainable\nIf you and your pup tend to bounce from space to space, consider getting them the safest space to bounce in, the Crispin by Tavo Pets. The Crispin crate is impact-tested and “benchmarked against the latest United Nations ECE child restraint standard,” another huge plus for pups on the go.\nAvailable in two colors and three sizes, this crate also features essential “crate-training” features, like a dim, den-like atmosphere and machine-washable pads. A quick note for pet parents:Car-crate-trainingis a skill in itself, so make sure you work on that before you hit the road.\nWomen Owned\nGives Back\nSustainable\nIf you’re looking for the crèmede la crate, look no further than the Diggs Evolv. As the name suggests, this crate is designed to grow with your pup, making it great for crate-training and beyond. Lightweight with over three points of access (two side doors and an add-on top that opens to make a playpen), this option also includes a puppy divider. That feature will help smaller puppies not feel overwhelmed by the size.\nAlso, the quality and safety features of this thing are bonkers, with pinch-free dual lock doors that keep puppy paws and jaws (not to mention human fingers) safe. It’s also available in three sizes —score.\nGives Back\nSustainable\nHow to choose the best dog-crate accessories\nAccording to Siegfried, accessories can be the key to getting your puppy on board with crate-training: “As a starting place, I recommend something for the dog to be able to interact with and chew on to build interest for getting in the crate in the first place.”\nAccessories can make things easier for pet parents, too, especially when it comes to crating beyond the training phase. Check out two brands that come with helpful add-ons.\nThe Revol is the Diggs OG crate —and the one that got us obsessed with the brand. While pairable with safe training accessories, like theirGroov Training Aidandattachable water bowl, the Revol crate is designed to take your pup past their crate-training days. Each of the four sizes comes with its own puppy divider, making this crate a lifelong investment for your pup.\nFor a budget-friendly, divider-compatible option, we love this plastic dog crate by Kindtail. With two size options, each large enough for small and medium adult dogs, this crate can be used with a divider during puppy-age crate training. We also love the six modern color options andthe matching portable bowl, perfect for filling with ahigh-value treatduring training.\nFAQs\n“How long can a puppy stay in a crate is generally one hour for every month they are old, plus one,” Siegfried says.\n“I think it’s the dealer’s choice here,” Siegfried says. “However, most dogs are sleeping in crates until they are house trained.”\n“Barking in the crate is just a function of either frustration or distress,” Siegfried says. “So, it’s not about stopping the barking, as much as it's about trying to understand the underlying motivation for the communication because all barking is just communication.”\nTo reduce or stop barking, you must address the problem at the root of the communication, whether that beseparation anxiety,physical discomfort, or something else. For more tips, check out our guide here.",

    "page_content": "When I first brought home my Miniature Poodle puppy, he kept having accidents on the floor right next to the door. He was so close to making it outside, but if I didn’t see him standing at the door, he wasn’t able to hold it.If only dogs could talk, I thought. Then I had an idea.\nI tied a bell to the door handle and taught my puppy to ring it with his nose when he wanted to go out to potty. It was a huge breakthrough in his potty training, and I celebrated. My dog was communicating with me!\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nBut could there be more to this human and canine communication? Could you teach a dog to talk? I talked to U.K.-based dog behaviorist and trainerAnnie-mae Levy, who says it just depends on how you define talking.\nCan dogs talk?\n“Dogs certainly do usebody languageand vocalizations to communicate with us,” Levy says. “For example, dogs might bark at us when frustrated or lick their lips a lot when feeling unsure.”\nAs it turns out, dogs can understand human words, which means you can talk to your dog. And your dog has the potential to talk back through targeting (touching an object with their nose or paw). They can do the same thing withbutton devicesthat allow your dog to “talk” to you about objects or activities.\nYes, dogs do understand words. Most dogs organically learn their own names as well as common terms like “walk,” “no,” and “treat” through simple association. Dogs can also be taught words, such as when you train your dog to sit, lie down, and come.\nStudies have shown that on averagedogs can learn about 165 words. So-called “super dogs” in the top 20th percentile of intelligence can learn 250 words. A famousBorder Collie named Chaser learned 1,022 words— on par with the vocabulary of a human three-year-old child.\nAccording to Levy, barking is similar to talking, but it’s far less complex than human language. “Dogs bark in many different pitches and patterns to signal lots of things,” she says. “Dogs do not communicate with us or one another like humans do, though. They bark to signal how they feel about something in their immediate environment usually.”\nThis guide will help you turn your dog training passion into a profession.\nHow to train a dog to talk\nWe can teach dogs a series of behaviors that build on each other allowing for greater communication between dog and human. Your communication will continue to grow whether your dog is responding to simple cues or hand signals, ringing a bell to go outside, or communicating through button devices that allow your dog  to “speak,” using your voice recordings.\nVerbal training\nTraining a dog to respond to verbal communication is a process of association. Positive-reinforcement training techniques make it simple to connect a word with a behavior (or an object). Use small treat rewards or praise when your dog gets it right. When teaching verbal cues, choose one specific word for the behavior and always use it. For instance, don’t say “down” sometimes and “lie down” other times — choose one or the other.\nTo teach a verbal cue, follow these steps:\nGet your dog’s attention.\nGet your dog’s attention.\nUsing a treat, lure the dog to perform the behavior.\nUsing a treat, lure the dog to perform the behavior.\nReward their success.\nReward their success.\nLure the dog to perform the behavior, and say the cue.\nLure the dog to perform the behavior, and say the cue.\nReward their success.\nReward their success.\nEventually fade the lure and just say the cue.\nEventually fade the lure and just say the cue.\nReward their success.\nReward their success.\nRepeat until they are consistent.\nRepeat until they are consistent.\nSo, how many cues can a dog learn? The possibilities are endless for many dogs. As long as you and your dog are enjoying the training process, you can teach your dog almost anything.\nHand signals\nCan dogs learn sign language? Yes! In fact, many dogs learn cues using both words and hand signals, and some respond faster to hand signals rather than verbal phrases. When teaching with hand signals, be sure to consistently use the same one every time.\nThe steps below explain how to teach a dog hand signals​:\nGet your dog’s attention.\nGet your dog’s attention.\nUsing a treat, lure the dog to perform the behavior.\nUsing a treat, lure the dog to perform the behavior.\nReward their success.\nReward their success.\nDisplay the hand signal, then lure the dog to perform the behavior.\nDisplay the hand signal, then lure the dog to perform the behavior.\nReward their success.\nReward their success.\nEventually fade the lure and just display the hand signal.\nEventually fade the lure and just display the hand signal.\nReward their success.\nReward their success.\nPair the verbal cue with the hand signal.\nPair the verbal cue with the hand signal.\nReward their success.\nReward their success.\nRepeat until they are consistent.\nRepeat until they are consistent.\nNose-targeting\nNose-targeting is a skill that can bring your dog’s communication to the next level. Simply put, you’re teaching your dog to touch an object with its nose. You can also teach dogs to target with their paws, but teach nose- targeting first; it’s easy to capture this behavior. Have you ever wondered,Why do dogs touch you with their nose? There’s a good reason: ​​Dogs are highly scent-driven, so they are naturally inclined to investigate things with their nose first.\nTo teach nose-targeting, follow these steps:\nHold your palm flat out toward your dog.\nHold your palm flat out toward your dog.\nReward any interest in your hand, such as sniffing.\nReward any interest in your hand, such as sniffing.\nRepeat until your dog is quickly investigating your hand.\nRepeat until your dog is quickly investigating your hand.\nBegin rewarding only for strong touches rather than sniffs.\nBegin rewarding only for strong touches rather than sniffs.\nIncrease the distance so your dog must come toward your hand to touch it.\nIncrease the distance so your dog must come toward your hand to touch it.\nReward their success.\nReward their success.\nAdd a verbal command, such as “touch.”\nAdd a verbal command, such as “touch.”\nRepeat until they are consistent.\nRepeat until they are consistent.\nOnce your dog understands the concept of nose targeting with your hand, you can transfer the skill to another object by presenting it close to your dog  and saying “touch.” Gradually move the object further from your dog so they must approach it to touch. Now you’re ready to teach your dog to ring a bell, like I did with my miniature poodle.\nBell training\nTeaching a dog that understands nose targeting to ring a bell is simple. This is a great skill that allows your dog to ask you to be let outside to potty. Here’s how to bell train a dog​:\nHang a bell from a door handle or somewhere close to your door.\nHang a bell from a door handle or somewhere close to your door.\nMake sure the bell is at your dog’s nose level.\nMake sure the bell is at your dog’s nose level.\nAsk your dog to nose-target the bell by saying, “Touch.”\nAsk your dog to nose-target the bell by saying, “Touch.”\nReward success by opening the door and giving a treat.\nReward success by opening the door and giving a treat.\nBegin rewarding only for strong touches rather than sniffs.\nBegin rewarding only for strong touches rather than sniffs.\nAlways open the door, and give them a treat.\nAlways open the door, and give them a treat.\nReward independent use of the bell with extra praise and treats.\nReward independent use of the bell with extra praise and treats.\nTools like speech buttons and translation apps reflect more aboutourdesires for our pets than their desires for themselves.\nButton training\nOnce your dog knows the “touch” cue, you can move on to teaching them to touch button devices. These devices are relatively new to the dog training scene. The buttons allow you to record your voice saying a word, such as “walk,” “treat,” or “outside.” Training your dog to touch the buttons to communicate is not only fun, but can increase your bond and understanding of each other.\nWhen these button devices first became popular, many people were skeptical that dogs were really understanding language and using the devices to “talk.” Arecent studysays that dogs are not simply imitating their owners when they touch the buttons, but are in fact using the devices deliberately with intent, including using two-word combinations to form simple “sentences.”\nTraining a dog to talk with button devices can be a long process, especially progressing from naming objects to naming activities like “go outside.” But Levy says it’s a process of association, similar to teaching dogs other skills.\n“Press the button yourself every time you do the action,” she adds. “As you’re walking through the front door you can press an ‘outside’ button. Once you have done a few reps of this, ask your dog to touch the button themselves and then complete the action. You will need to repeat this about 50 times for your dog to start to understand the association.”\nHere’s how to train dogs to use buttons in simple steps:\nRecord the word you want to teach on the button (for example, “Ball”).\nRecord the word you want to teach on the button (for example, “Ball”).\nPress the button for the ball and present the ball.\nPress the button for the ball and present the ball.\nRepeat this many times.\nRepeat this many times.\nAsk your dog to nose-target the button by saying, “Touch.”\nAsk your dog to nose-target the button by saying, “Touch.”\nPresent the ball when the dog presses the button.\nPresent the ball when the dog presses the button.\nRepeat this many times.\nRepeat this many times.\nRepeat and build your training vocabulary to include objects, actions, and behaviors.\nRepeat and build your training vocabulary to include objects, actions, and behaviors.\n“There are tons of videos you can use on the internet if you get stuck, but the premise is pretty simple—have your dog touch the button, and then follow up with the associated behavior or action,” Levy says.\nHow to find a button-communication device\nDog-button devices are available online and in some pet-supply stores. Most devices are recordable so you can customize the words you want to teach your dog. Teaching this skill can take a long time, but it can be a rewarding activity. If you’re having trouble, reach out to a reputable dog trainer who is comfortable working with the buttons.\nReferences\nAmalia, et al. “How Do Soundboard-Trained Dogs Respond to Human Button Presses?

Starting at the right age with effective techniques can make the process smoother for both you and your puppy. Here, we’ll explore when to begin potty training, share proven methods, and provide practical tips to ensure a successful and stress-free experience.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat age should you potty train a puppy?\nPotty training your puppy can be a daunting task, it requires patience, time management, and proper treat timing. Potty training a puppy should begin as soon as you bring them home that way you set everyone up for success from the start. A puppy should be at least eight weeks old when you bring them home. If possible, they should be between nine to 12 weeks old, which can be a more ideal time.\nAllowing a puppy to spend those weeks with their mother and siblings is crucial to their development.  Potty training should begin before your puppy comes home. Make things easier on yourself by prepping ahead of time. Important items to have to set you and your puppy up for success are:a crate,pee pads/newspapers, paper towels, urine cleaner(without ammonia), a six-foot leash, and a collar, to name a few.\nA puppy can hold their pee for about the number of months they are, plus one, so a two-month old puppy can ideally hold themselves for three hours in a perfect setting. If your new puppy will be home alone for more than a few hours without a potty break, it is a helpful idea to set up a potty area for your pet. Set up a small gated area where your puppy can be comfortable on one side with a potty area on the other. This will help your puppy learn that peeing or pooping in one area is allowed, and they do not have free range to go just anywhere.\nPuppies and dogs do not typically want to soil an area where they sleep. So, they should naturally stay away from their comfortable area and use the potty area you set up when they are left for longer periods of time. This does not always work for puppies who are coming from deplorable conditions and who were confined to one area and have been eating, sleeping, and peeing in the same space since birth. It is never too late to potty train a puppy or dog. Depending on their age or past life, it just may be more complicated.\nIf anything requires patience, it’s this.\nPuppy potty training timeline\nThere is no true expected timeline for puppy training your puppy. It can take anywhere from four months to six months, but some puppies may take a year to betrulypotty trained. By being consistent and patient, you can help speed up the process. If you become lackadaisical and allow your puppy to have preventable accidents, then the timeline with take longer. Consistency is key.\nBegin to show your puppy the ropes. Introduce them to their new home, and get them comfortable with the areas where they are allowed. Start a potty schedule and introduce your family members to the puppy rules. Expect accidents; they are bound to happen, so stay calm and patient.\nTake your puppy outside every half an hour when they are awake and moving about. Observe what they do right before they pee and poop so that you know when they need to go outside.\nBegin to notice your puppy adjusting to their new environment. You will start to understand their cues and anticipate their behaviors, which will help you know when they need to use the bathroom.\nTake your puppy out every 30 to 60 minutes depending on how they are doing with successful potties outside versus accidents.\nThe puppy will start to understand some consistent precursors of their schedule (for example, they excited when you pick up a leash). They may be able to anticipate where to go for feeding time, or to run to the front door when you get your shoes.\nYour puppy is getting more comfortable in their environment if you are beginning to see less accidents you can begin to increase the amount of time between potty breaks. Do not get too comfortable with the success; you want to continue to keep up with the schedule to help your puppy learn.\nPuppy potty training tips\nAlways take a puppy outside a few minutes after they have eaten or drank a lot, played, or woken up.\nAlways take a puppy outside a few minutes after they have eaten or drank a lot, played, or woken up.\nWhen a puppy is sleeping/ alone/ just laying around; a puppy can hold their pee for about as many hours as they are months old, plus one.\nWhen a puppy is sleeping/ alone/ just laying around; a puppy can hold their pee for about as many hours as they are months old, plus one.\nExample:\nA three-month-old puppy can hold it for four hours.\nA three-month-old puppy can hold it for four hours.\nA four-month old puppy can hold it for five hours.\nA four-month old puppy can hold it for five hours.\nThis rule does not apply when your puppy is out and about playing, eating, or interacting (stick to your schedule during those times).\nScolding a puppy for having accidents is training them to hide from you when they pee or poop. It does not prevent them from going inside; it just teaches them to hide behind a something when they go to the bathroom so their owner can’t see. If your puppy has an accident, and you did not witness them do it, never scold them for something in the past. Instead, just calmly clean it up like nothing happened.\nIf your puppy has an accident in front of you try to interrupt them (with a calm “eh, eh”) and bring them outside as fast as possible (carrying them may be best), place them down and they may finish going outside be sure to reward them heavily. If they do not go when you get outside head back inside and then go back outside and try again in 15 to 30 minutes.\nIf you are potty training in an apartment or a large home with a long walk outside, it may be best to carry your puppy outside for potty breaks when starting (especially after drinking/eating, sleeping, or playin)g. This will help avoid any accidents in transit.\nPuppies and children are very similar just like routines help children they also help puppies. Doing your routine in a similar sequence each time will help your puppy anticipate chains of events. Example: Take your puppy out when they first wake up in the morning, then play with them, next feed them breakfast, wait 10 minutes, and take them out again.\nA new puppy or dog should never be left unattended to start. Freedom in your home is something that is earned over time. Puppies are teething, and it is likely that they will get into and chew inappropriate things which can be dangerous. It is very important to puppy-proof your home when you bring home a new dog. Supervising your puppy at all times will also prevent accidents.\nIf you need to use the bathroom or leave the room for a short time, this is a great time to crate your dog. Using the crate for short periods of time while you leave or while you are around, helps build a positive association with the crate which will help your puppy with crate-training.\nWhen potty training, you want to use a quick and easy treat that can be given to your puppy right away after they use the pee or poop. You will want to use a soft, high-value treat. You do not want to use something crunchy that takes a long time to chew. While your puppy is going, you can verbally praise them and as soon as they are done, pop the treat in their mouth.\nYou shouldn’t make them cross their legs for long!\nCan you train potty on a verbal cue?\nYes. You can train your dog to go potty on cue to an extent (of course, if they don’t need to poop or pee, and you say the cue, they won’t do it). To start, you are going to begin pairing the word with the action. As your puppy pees, say the words ”go potty” a few times.\nDo this over and over for a few weeks. As you are taking your puppy to pee, begin to keep an eye on what they do right before they go. Once you have an idea of the precursor to your puppy peeing, you can then say the cue right before they go.\nTo train your puppy to go poop or pee right when you take them out, rather than having to walk them around to find the perfect area you will need to designate a potty area. A designated potty area is where you take your puppy when you want them to use the bathroom. Potty breaks and walks are not the same thing. Bring your puppy to the designated area before taking them on a walk.\nOnly take them on a walk after they have relieved themself in the designated potty area. The walk becomes a natural reward for going poop or pee. This is especially beneficial when you are running late or only have a small window of time to take your dog to the bathroom before having to go somewhere.\nFAQs\nTypically puppies can hold their pee for a few hours. You can follow the rule that puppies can hold their pee the number of months they are old, plus one (a three-month old puppy can hold their pee for four hours). A rule of thumb when beginning potty training is: Puppies should always taken out shortly after eating, playing, or sleeping.\nTry clearing a spot for your puppy on the grass by shoveling a space for them. If you have a very young puppy or small dog and know a bad storm is coming, it may be a good idea to have pee pads on hand just in case.\nPotty training an adult dog is very similar to potty training a puppy. The only difference is that adult dogs can hold it for much longer. Adult dogs may have many years of pooping or peeing wherever they want so you will have to rewire this habit. You may be able to increase the time between potty breaks faster as your dog gets the idea. Start taking your adult dog outside to use the potty every hour, as well as after eating, playing, and sleeping.\nAs they get the idea of what to do continue to increase the time between potty breaks. Using a crate when you can not have your eyes on your dog is the key to success, a dog will typically pee where they sleep.\nReferences\nKalstone, Shirlee.How to Housebreak Your Dog in 7 Days (Revised).

    "page_content": "From an early age, we’re given choices: Do we want the red toy or the blue one? Do we want apple juice or orange?BlueyorPaw Patrol? Even when this leads to toddler tantrums — especially when we want the pink toy, and that wasn’t one of the offerings — it teaches us that we have autonomy. We are our own people. Guess what? We can give that same sense of independence to our pups.\nBeing able to make choices can benefit dogs in so many ways. This can be as simple as presenting them options: you can hold up two toys and see which one they take, or put a treat in each hand and whichever hand they sniff opens up to give them what they selected. Another way to give them a choice is to follow their lead without interrupting them — follow the way they go on a walk without encouraging them to go in a particular direction or let them sniff for as long as they want without hurrying them along. Other opportunities for choices can be given by having multiple options available (beds, couches, rooms, and people) and simply letting them be when they make a choice about where to spend their time.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHaving agency gives them a sense of control over their environment. When dogs interact with their surroundings in their own way, they are gathering knowledge and improving skills to use in the future. They become better-behaved dogs simply by having the ability tochoose. Here’s how.\nThey are more actively engaged with what’s around them.\nIf animals are given agency, they tend to approach the world with the excitement of possibilities about what they can do in each new place they visit. They tend to act in an exploratory and flexible way. If they aren’t given agency, they tend to be concerned about what will happen to them and aremore likely to be reactive,withdraw, and act in an inflexible way. Dogs who have control over their lives (to a degree; let’s not get wild!) are more actively engaged in what’s around them.\nThey are less stressed out.\nA major factor that causesstress in pupsis a lack of control. Dogs who have choices feel more power over their environment. In some ways, that may be obvious. If they are able to choose where to go on a walk, they canavoid things that bother them, such as lawnmowers or another dog barking in a neighbor’s yard.\nIn other cases, the advantage may be more subtle. They are free toinvestigate smellsthat their humans are totally unaware of or explore something new. Uncertainty leads to stress; control alleviates it, and that is good for their health.\nThey have better lives overall (and so will you).\nA dog who gets to make choices will be able to enjoy life more, because they get to do more of what they want, when they want. Making choices also adds mental stimulation andenrichment to their livesbecause of the work involved in actively choosing. They learn from their choices, and that can add to their confidence.\nThey are less likely to experience frustration because they are not constantly being prevented from doing what they want to do. For example, if you give them the choice between astuffed Kongor apuzzle toy, they get what they want, and you won’t have to hear their exasperated whines or barks. (Although, when it comes to that example, they may want both!) These dogs alsowon’t be bored, because they have the freedom to engage in activities that they find interesting, not just what youthinkthey might like.\nThey’ll have better relationships with their pet parents.\nGiving our dogs options gives them a way to tell us what they prefer. Then, we can respond by offering them what they want in the future. With responsive communication, they’ll be less frustrated.\nA more collaborative approach to adventures, as well as in daily life,improves relationships. It’s easier on us, too, to know that we are doing what appeals to our dogs. Understanding each other is always good for our relationship, so honoring their choices improves our bond.\nIf they prefer one type oftraining treatover another, we can offer them the one they like best, and that makes them happier and makes training more effective. If we learn which way they would like to go on a walk, we know their preferred route and can act accordingly. When we know where they want to sleep or which type ofdog bedthey choose, we can offer them the best, most comfortable options. This makes it easier for us to be better parents to them.\nIt comes down to this: When dogs have the opportunity to make choices, that freedom doesso muchfor them. They are likely to be more confident and to feel closer to their pet parents as a result. Most of all, they are going to enjoy their lives more, which is all most of us really want for our kids, erm, dogs.\nReferences\nAgency and the Calibration of Motivated Behavior\nAgency and the Calibration of Motivated Behavior",

The biggest pro of diaper use is that it contains the mess from pee, poop, ordogs in heat. In healthy dogs who can be potty trained, diapers should never be used as an alternative; they cause potential health complications. That said, there are cases where diapering is necessary and can be managed when pet parents are able to provide the necessary round-the-clock care and monitoring.\nIncontinence management:This is the primary reason dogs may need diapers long-term. Dogs with urinary or fecal incontinence have no control over their urine and poop and cannot be trained to hold it until their next walk. Without a diaper or other method to contain their urine and poop, they would otherwise have accidents in the house.\nIncontinence management:This is the primary reason dogs may need diapers long-term.

Without a diaper or other method to contain their urine and poop, they would otherwise have accidents in the house.\nNeurological problems,spinal injuries, severe joint disease:Dogs with injuries or congenital abnormalities in their spine or nerves may be unable to stand or walk. These injuries can sometimes damage the nerves connected to the bladder and rectum. Affected dogs may be incontinent as a result. Other times, they may have some control over their urine and poop but are unable to posture properly to push it out. This can also happen insenior dogswith advanced arthritis, other joint disease, orcognitive dysfunction.

Be sure you or another member of your family will be available to change the diaper frequently. Diapers need to be changed soon as pups pee or poop or at least six to eight times per day for dogs who continuously leak urine. You’ll also have to be prepared to do additional baths to protect your pup’s skin and hind end from infections and other complications. This may result in more frequent veterinary visits or expenses, so be sure toplan ahead for these complications. If you are prepared for the journey of managing your pup in diapers, here are some additional considerations for finding the proper diaper:\nDepending on your dog’s condition and needs, different kinds of diapers may be more suitable:\nDisposable diapers:Disposable diapers have the benefit of not needing to be cleaned and reused. This may be best for pet parents without easy access to a washer/dryer, as well as in situations where there is a large amount of urine or feces that may be difficult to fully clean out of a diaper. Of course, from a sustainability point of view, disposable diapers create more waste.\nDisposable diapers:Disposable diapers have the benefit of not needing to be cleaned and reused.

Cloth fabric may also be less irritating on the skin for some dogs.

Dogs who are paralyzed in their lower back or hind legs may not be able to feel the diaper at all, and that may make it a lot easier for them to accept it. In all cases, you’ll want to have an intentional approach to introducing the diaper.\nCreate a calm environment:When you initially test out the diaper, be sure to do so in a calm, quiet environment.

Diapers trap moisture, urine and fecal matter which are then in direct contact with the skin. This tends to lead to skin irritation at a minimum. With long-term use, these skin irritations can lead to more serious problems. Dogs who wear diapers need pet parents to be vigilant about changing the diapers frequently round the clock, promoting healthy skin and coats, and knowing when to see a vet at the first signs of a complication.\nDiaper changing frequency:Diapers need to be changed as soon as they become soiled as well as every few hours to reduce the chance for skin irritation.\nDiaper changing frequency:Diapers need to be changed as soon as they become soiled as well as every few hours to reduce the chance for skin irritation.\nPotential skin issues\nPotential skin issues\nRash and irritation:This is the most common complication for dogs wearing diapers and is almost inevitable with long-term use.

This can cause minor irritation and hair loss at first but can also put dogs at risk for additional skin infections or deeper pressure sores. Once this pattern sets in, it can be difficult for the skin to heal so long as the source of chafing (the diaper) is still in place. It may require you to take a break from diapering altogether or use a different style of diaper that does not rub in that area to allow the skin to heal.\nChafing: Even the best fitting diaper will rub against the skin repeatedly in certain areas, which can lead to chafing long-term.

The best option is to limit diaper use to only the most necessary times of day and to try to give your dog’s skin a break from the diaper for long stretches of time. Additionally, you’ll need to bathe your dog regularly, as well as every time they have a soiled diaper that results in feces or urine-soaked fur. If they do develop skin irritation, you may need to use additional topical products to protect their skin and keep them as clean and dry as possible. Always consult your vet before applying anything to your dog’s skin.\nSkin care routine:Protecting your dog’s skin will be crucial to minimizing these complications.

A dog-specific diaper will likely be the best option for longer term use.\nThis depends on your dog’s condition and why you feel they may need a diaper. Be sure to see a vet to discuss your concerns and possible alternatives. Some conditions like incontinence may be treated with medication, surgery, or other measures that will help you avoid diapers.\nDiapers are usually seen as a last resort since they have such a high rate of complications and can be very difficult for pet parents to manage long-term. Most vets will try to find other creative solutions.\nWhile it is possible for a dog to wear a diaper overnight, the longer the diaper is in place, the higher the risk of irritation from contact with urine or poop as well as pressure sores from the diaper itself. If your dog needs to wear a diaper, it is best to change the diaper multiple times overnight, especially any time it gets soiled.\nDiapers can collect poop and prevent messes in the home; however, when dogs poop in a diaper, it creates a lot of complications for them. First is that inevitably the poop gets into their fur, requiring a thorough bath nearly every time. Additionally, when poop is contact with the skin for any length of time, it can irritate the skin and lead to infections and wounds.\nPoop near the genitals also puts dogs at a high risk forurinary tract infections. In short, it is not an ideal situation for dogs by any means and requires a lot of round the clock care to manage complications. All other solutions should be considered first.\nReferences\nAmbar, Nita, et al. “Suspected hemolytic anemia secondary to acute zinc toxicity after ingestion of “max strength” (zinc oxide) diaper rash cream.”Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care, vol. 32, no. 1, 27 August 2021, pp. 125-128.\nAmbar, Nita, et al. “Suspected hemolytic anemia secondary to acute zinc toxicity after ingestion of “max strength” (zinc oxide) diaper rash cream.”Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care, vol. 32, no. 1, 27 August 2021, pp. 125-128.\nBubenik, Loretta. “Urinary Tract Infection in Dogs with Thoracolumbar Intervertebral Disc Herniation and Urinary Bladder Dysfunction Managed by Manual Expression, Indwelling Catheterization or Intermittent Catheterization.”Veterinary Surgery, vol. 37, no. 8, December 2008, pp. 791-800.\nBubenik, Loretta. “Urinary Tract Infection in Dogs with Thoracolumbar Intervertebral Disc Herniation and Urinary Bladder Dysfunction Managed by Manual Expression, Indwelling Catheterization or Intermittent Catheterization.”Veterinary Surgery, vol. 37, no. 8, December 2008, pp. 791-800.\nGranger, Nicolas, et al. “Bladder and Bowel Management in Dogs With Spinal Cord Injury.”Frontiers in Veterinary Science.

Yet, introducing these two famously feisty species can feel like refereeing a wrestling match.\nWill the cat claim their throne as the ruler of the house, or will the puppy with boundless energy win the day? Will the pair become best friends, or will they remain mortal enemies?\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nIntroducing anew dog into a cat’s domainis like setting up a blind date between an extreme introvert and an extrovert. These species are opposites, and cats are renowned for being territorial. In contrast, puppies are energetic, curious, and sometimes clueless. So introducing these two takes patience and preparation.\nRead on to learn how to introduce a puppy to a cat in your household. But also keep in mind that harmony is the end goal, but civility is what you’ll settle for — at least for now.\nUnderstanding the nature of dogs and cats\nCats and dogs are as different as night and day. While their personalities are unique to each pet, their overall natures, instincts, and behaviors are ingrained as a species.\nFor instance, cats are territorial, often valuing space, quiet, solitude, and routine. Their body language is subtle, like a flicking tail that indicates irritation or a slow blink to express affection. Puppies, on the other hand, are balls of energetic enthusiasm, especially when young. They barrel into new situations with wagging tails and boundless curiosity.\nThis dynamic can create confusion and frustration when your new puppy’s eagerness is met with your cat’s “stay away” glare. The good news is that cats and dogs aren’t doomed to misunderstand each other forever. You canbridge the gapbetween these feline and canine personalities with guidance and patience.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nPreparing for the introduction\nBefore you bring these two pets together, you’ll need to do some prep work. A little effort from the get-go can ensure a smoother meeting process.\nStart by evaluating your cat’s and pup’s personalities. For example, is your cat confident or skittish? Are they quick to swipe, growl, hiss, or run away when faced with something (or someone) new? Is your puppy playful or laidback? Do they bound from one thing to another, sniffing and snuffling recklessly? Or do they love napping and begging for belly rubs?\nSome personalities clash more than others. A shy cat may need extra time and space, while a rambunctious pup may need more training to curb excessive excitement. Knowing their temperaments will help you predict potential challenges and outcomes, and allow you to tailor your approach to make sure your pets are comfortable during this process.\nA clean, comfortable, well-prepared home is essential for a smooth introduction. Designate separate spaces for your cat and puppy which contain their food, water, toys, and bedding. Use baby gates or a strategically placed crate to establish boundaries, giving each pet time to adjust to new smells, sounds, and sights.\nYour cat should have access to elevated areas, like shelves or cat trees, where they can observe the puppy safely. Cats need time to acclimate, especially if your pup is already bigger and more rambunctious than your cat can handle. Elevation gives them an escape route if they feel overwhelmed.\nCreate separate spaces:Provide your cat with a quiet room containing their bed, toys, and litter box. Set up a crate for your puppy to give them a secure, cozy area.\nCreate separate spaces:Provide your cat with a quiet room containing their bed, toys, and litter box.

However, with patience and a step-by-step approach, you can tame this whirlwind before it becomes an issue. The goal is to create positive associations and peaceful interactions, reducing the risk of aggression or misunderstandings between your cat and pup.\nHere are a few tips to help your pets transition from wary acquaintances to comfortable companions who can peacefully share a home.\nCats and dogs have high-powered noses and use scent markers to make a space theirs. Start by swapping scents between pets. Place a blanket or toy from your puppy in your cat’s space, and vice versa. This allows each animal to familiarize themselves with the other’s scent in a non-threatening way and at their own pace.\nLet your cat and puppy explore each other’s spaces separately. This helps them acclimate to each other’s presence without direct contact. Keep doors closed, or use a baby gate to create a safe barrier.\nHave both pets become comfortable with each other’s scent and overall presence? Introduce them visually. Keep your puppy leashed, and let your cat approach at their own pace. Watch for aggressive body language, like raised fur, hissing, or growling from either animal. A relaxed cat will have soft ears, while a calm puppy will wag their tail.\nAllow them to be in the same room together while your puppy is leashed. Sit down, create a safe, calm space with your presence, and let them interact. Offer treats to both pets to develop positive associations with peaceful, friendly behavior.\nYou can allow supervised, off-leash interactions once your cat and puppy are comfortable. Keep sessions short and monitor their behavior. If either pet becomes stressed or aggravated, separate them immediately and try again later.\nThe goal is for interaction to become a nonissue, where you no longer have to worry about aggressive or anxious behaviors.\nHow to manage introduction issues\nEven the best-laid plans can have challenges when introducing a puppy to a cat. Cats and dogs communicate differently, and mismatched body language can lead to growls, hisses, loud barks, and chasing around the house. While these moments are stressful, they’re manageable.\nWith patience and strategic planning, you can address common introduction issues and set the stage for peaceful coexistence. Check out these examples of common problems and how to address them.\nPuppies are naturally curious and playful, so your cat’s movements may trigger their instinct to chase. Training is essential. To prevent chasing, teach your puppy commands like “stay” or “leave it.” Redirect their energy with plenty of mental stimulation and exercise. Ensure that your cat has access to elevated areas or safe rooms where your pup can’t reach them.\nCats often act out of fear or territoriality. Your cat may show aggression or hostility with hisses, swats, or avoidance. Respect your cat’s space by ensuring a safe zone where the pup is not allowed. Go back to scent swapping to reintroduce your puppy to your cat gradually. Reward your cat with praise and treats to create positive associations and reinforce calm behavior.\nPuppies may not understand that cats value personal space. Use a leash to control interactions, keeping your puppy from being too pushy. If the puppy continues pestering your cat, calmly remove them from the situation to signal that their behavior is unacceptable.\nIntroducing a new puppy to a cat can be overwhelming for both pets, especially if the cat is older or if either pet was adopted from a shelter. You never know the extent of trauma in an adopted pet’s past.\nAccording toPam Johnson Bennett, a certified cat behaviorist with more than 50 years of experience and expertise, you should “move at the pace of the most stressed-out pet and remember that nothing matters more than keeping everyone safe.” Slow down the process. There’s no rush. Repeat earlier steps, such as swapping scents and leashed interactions, to give both pets time to adjust. Offer soothing toys and treats to calm anxiety. If issues persist, consult a veterinarian or animal behaviorist for advice.\nFAQs\nThe time it takes for a cat to get used to a new puppy varies, but typically ranges from a few days to a few months. This depends on the cat’s temperament and the puppy’s behavior. Confident cats may warm up quickly, while shy ones may need more time to acclimate to a new puppy’s energy and presence. The key is to move gradually and respect your cat’s comfort level. Avoid rushing the process.\nCats accept new puppies more easily and readily when introductions are gradual, and their routines remain consistent. Starting with scent swapping and slow, supervised interactions can help ease this transition. Providing your cat with safe spaces and elevated areas ensures they feel secure and less threatened.\nCreating a bond between your cat and puppy involves calm, positive experiences where both pets feel safe, loved, and rewarded. Use treats, praise, and positive reinforcement to encourage peaceful behavior. Some cats may take longer to warm up to dogs, so give your cat plenty of patience and space. Never rush direct interactions.\nReferences\n“American Kennel Club.” American Kennel Club, 2017,www.akc.org/press-center/articles-resources/facts-and-stats/cats-dogs-together.\n“American Kennel Club.” American Kennel Club, 2017,www.akc.org/press-center/articles-resources/facts-and-stats/cats-dogs-together.\n‌“How to Introduce a Dog and Cat.” Animal Humane Society,www.animalhumanesociety.org/resource/how-introduce-dog-and-cat.\n‌“How to Introduce a Dog and Cat.” Animal Humane Society,www.animalhumanesociety.org/resource/how-introduce-dog-and-cat.\nJohnson-Bennett, Pam. “Pam’s Story.” Pam Johnson-Bennett Answers the Why, When & How of Cat Behavior Issues, 20 Jan. 2010,catbehaviorassociates.com/pams-story.\nJohnson-Bennett, Pam. “Pam’s Story.” Pam Johnson-Bennett Answers the Why, When & How of Cat Behavior Issues, 20 Jan. 2010,catbehaviorassociates.com/pams-story.\n‌“Making Friends: Introduction & Socialization Tips.”Aspcapetinsurance.com, 2015,www.aspcapetinsurance.com/resources/making-friends-introduction-socialization-tips.\n‌“Making Friends: Introduction & Socialization Tips.”Aspcapetinsurance.com, 2015,www.aspcapetinsurance.com/resources/making-friends-introduction-socialization-tips.",

    "page_content": "Bringing a new puppy home can be daunting and exhausting, but going into it prepared can help save you a lot of headaches. Potty training is specific to each puppy; each puppy you potty train will have their personality, schedule and things that work for them or don’t. There is no set number of times you should take your puppy out, but there are some rules to follow that will make potty training easier for you and your dog. Following these rules will prevent unwanted accidents and help potty training go smoothly.\nI grew up in a no-dog household, so as soon as I got my own home, I was determined to bring a puppy home. As someone who never had a pup, I didallthe research before bringing my puppy home. I made sure I knew everything I could know. I truly believe this is what helped make bringing home a puppy easier and less stressful for our family.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nI knew what to expect, how to prevent problems before they happened, and how to train my puppy in a positive manner. Jaxon, a tiny rescue mutt, helped mold the dog trainer that I am today. Jaxon was a perfect puppy in all aspects — except potty training. In fact, I thought he would never get potty trained, there were many tears over it. With all the information I now have potty training him could have been a little easier, and if you are prepared it can be easier for you as well.\nIf anything requires patience, it’s this.\nHow often should I take my puppy out?\nThe younger the puppy the more frequent they will need to go out. Potty training takes time to learn and understand. Dogs do not naturally understand the notion that we peed outside and not inside.\nWhen puppies are resting or home alone, you can follow the general rule that a puppy can hold pee for the number of months they are old, plus one (a three-month-old puppy can hold it for four hours). When beginning potty training, you will need to take your puppy out overnight you should set an alarm following the above rule to let your puppy out. If you hear your puppy stirring or whining before the alarm goes off, you may also want to get up and take them out to potty. Be sure to work on positive crate-training during the day so that your puppy happily sleeps in the crate through the night and you don’t have to try to decipher if they are whining just to get out of the crate or if they need to use the bathroom.\nThe size and breed of your puppy may also affect how easy or hard they are to potty train. It can affect how often they need to be taken out. Small dogs need to be taken out more frequently over the course of their lives. Small dogs will have a small bladder that can only hold so much.\nHere are some breeds that are more difficult to potty train: Beagles, Bichon Frisé, Chihuahuas, and Dachshunds to name a few. Patience, consistency, andpositive reinforcementwill help you get on the right track. Always be sure to do your research when adopting a dog to make sure they are the right fit for your family.\nChoosing a diet for your new puppy is hard to do. When picking a food, you want to look for quality ingredients, making sure a protein is listed as the first ingredient on the bag. Puppy digestive systems are new and take time to get use to new foods. When switching your puppy’s foods, it is important to go slowly. They can easily get an upset stomach from new foods and treats.\nDogswho eat raw foodmay need to use the bathroom more often since their food is filled with more moisture than just plain kibble.\nOnce you know there are no issues you can completely switch your puppy over to the new food. If you notice anything is bothering your puppy's stomach, stay on each step for a bit longer. If your puppy is having extended issues on a new food, reach out to your vet your puppy may have an intolerance to certain foods.\nAfter bringing your puppy home, you will want to bring them to the vet for a health evaluation and make sure they are up to dateon their vaccines. This will help you better understand your puppy in case there are any health issues you need to know about.\nTalk to your vet if: you notice your puppy going to the bathroom frequently or their urine is a darker color, has a bad smell, or they are drinking an excess amount of water.\nA training schedule is important especially if you have multiple people in the household who will be watching or taking care of your puppy. A schedule helps keep everyone in the know and will help prevent many predictable accidents. Taking your puppy out on schedule will help them understand what pottying is and where/when it should happen. The more times you catch your dog peeing or pooping in the right spot and reward them for it, the easier potty training will be.A schedulewill keep everyone in the loop to help keep potty training moving along smoothly.\nYour puppy should always go out right after eating, drinking (if it was a lot of water), playing, or sleeping. These activities get the bowels moving, and they will typically need to use the bathroom. To this day, both my adult dogs ring the bell to go out shortly after their meals.\nHow many times a day should a puppy pee?\nThere is no specific answer to how many times a day your puppy should pee. This answer will vary due to your puppy’s age, size, breed, and health status. When you begin potty training, you will be taking your puppy out every 30 minutes to an hour, and they may pee almost every time. As your puppy gets older, you can begin to increase the amount of time between bathroom breaks as long as your puppy is having minimal accidents.\nHow many times a day should a puppy poop?\nPuppies may poop twice a day, but it is not unusual for them to poop upwards of four to six times a day. Keep an eye on the type of poop your puppy is having. If they are pooping many times a day and having diarrhea, talk to your vet.\nAfter eating a meal, be sure to take your puppy out within a few minutes of finishing. Your puppy may be able to poop that soon after eating. If you know your puppy is due to poop but hasn’t yet, you will want to adjust your bathroom schedule to account for that.\nYou shouldn’t make them cross their legs for long!\nHow to create a puppy bathroom schedule\nWhen formatting a bathroom schedule for your new puppy, automatically start with every 30 minutes. On top of taking your puppy out right after eating, playing, and sleeping.\nKeep in mind the breed, age, and health of your puppy when building your schedule these will affect how often you take your puppy out. You will need to adjust this schedule as you get to know your puppy. Did they have a few accidents today? You will want to shorten the amount of time between potty breaks.\nDid your puppy have a perfect day today with no accidents? Do a second day at that time interval before increasing. Depending on the age of your dog increasing by five to 10 minutes should be enough. As your time intervals increase, continue to take your puppy out after eating, playing, and sleeping.\nThe key to successful potty training is rewarding your puppy for using the bathroom where you want them to. Select a treat that is easy for your dog to eat (you dont want something super crunchy that takes a long time to chew). If you find your dog is struggling with potty training pick a special treat that is only used during potty time. Freeze-dried liver; low-sodium turkey dogs; or freeze-dried, raw-food nibbles are good places to start.\nFAQs\nIf you have noticed your dog’s bathroom routine change, it is important to talk to your vet. Your dog may have a UTI or another health issue that is causing them to need to use the bathroom more often.\nWhen puppies are sleeping or relaxing, they should be able to hold their pee for the number of months they are, plus one. So, a three month old puppy can hold their pee for four hours. This does not apply when your puppy is playing, eating, or out and about. You will need to stick to your potty schedule and take them out as frequently as they need, beginning with 30 to 60 minute increments.\nPotty training a puppy is all about your schedule, staying consistent, and being patient. Begin by taking your puppy out every 30 to 60 minutes. Increase the time intervals as they become more successful at holding their pee and understanding they should pee outside.\nNeverpunish your puppyfor having an accident. If they do, calmly clean it up and get back on track with your schedule. When you punish a puppy for peeing or pooping where they shouldn’t, all they learn is that their pet parent acts scary when they go to the bathroom. This can cause your puppy to continue to have accidents and hide from you when they do. They may also stop going to the bathroom for you on a leash because they are scared.\nReferences\nDunbar, Ian.Before and After Getting Your Puppy : The Positive Approach to Raising a Happy, Healthy, and Well-Behaved Dog.

Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nMethods to help train your dog to sit\nOne of the most reliable techniques to train your dog to sit (or stay, or go to their mat, or even execute a fancy flip-finish trick) is the lure method. According toErin Whelan, founder ofLittle Wolf Dog Training, the lure method involves placing a small piece of food in your hand and moving it in such a way as to lure your dog to perform the desired behavior. In this case, sitting. Who doesn’t love some positive reinforcement? And snacks?\nAnother method uses a box clicker, a small noisemaker that makes a short, percussive click sound that sends a definite cue to your dog.  Trainer Robert Haussmann of Dogboy NYC, says, “The clicker is used to connect the desired behavior to the reward. Timing is important, and the clicker can be used to immediately mark when the dog completes the behavior and clarify why they are being rewarded.”\nLook behind the advertising language when picking a dog trainer.\nSupplies you’ll need before training\nAs for supplies, Haussmann says you can buy a clicker if you want to, (though you can also just use your voice) he also recommends that his clients purchase a pouch for holding treats, especially one that cango into the dishwasher.\nThen, of course, you’ll need the goodies themselves.Haussmann says, “Treats should be small so your dog can have multiple in a training session. They should vary in value, so the dog never knows what they’re gonna get and is eager to stay engaged. You should definitely have some very high value treats that are rare and special to your dog.”\nHow to train your dog to sit\nNow that you are stocked up, you and your dog are ready to get to work. Whelan recommends the following steps:\nHold a treat in your hand. She says, “I recommend placing the treat in-between your fingertips, so your hand makes a sort of tear drop shape.”\nHold a treat in your hand. She says, “I recommend placing the treat in-between your fingertips, so your hand makes a sort of tear drop shape.”\nMove the treat above your dog’s head.\nMove the treat above your dog’s head.\nHold your fingertips against your dog’s nose so they are aware of the treat.

You want to keep it interesting and turn your dog into a compulsive gambler.”\nYour senior dog might move slower these days, but that doesn’t mean they can’t learn new things.\nFAQs\n“This completely depends on the dog, the environment in which they're working, the level of distractions present, and the value of the reinforcer involved,” Whelan says. “I’ve seen dogs learn how to sit on cue fairly reliably in just a few minutes, and I once had a Frenchie in one of my group classes who finally got there after five to six weeks of both me AND his guardians working with him.”\nWhelan’s advice: “I always recommend working with your dog for up to one minute at a time when you’re just starting your training journey. Some dogs are born with incredible stamina, and for others it can take time to build the drive to work for longer periods of time. Set a timer for one minute, do a bit of work, then give them a quick break. You can play with them for a few minutes — if they enjoy that, toss a few treats into a snuffle mat.  When they're done, do another minute.  I always encourage my clients to keep their training sessions short, especially to start, and to stop while their dog is still enjoying themselves.”\nHaussmann says, “I recommend training any cue in a variety of voice tones, otherwise you'll have to say it the same way every time you give your dog the cue.”\n“It usually means you are in an environment that is too distracting, or you are working with an overly tired puppy. Change what you are doing or seek professional help,” Haussmann says.\nHe warns against frustration about what may seem like anti-social acting out by your dog during training saying, “People tend to feel the need to raise their voice or become stern when a dog is less compliant or able to listen. The dog’s compliance is usually dependent on the environment and external distraction. It is important to recognize what your dog is capable of before putting them in a situation that may be un-winnable for you and your dog. If you put your dog up above their grade level, then shout and get agitated until they comply, training becomes less fun for both you and your dog.”\n“Practice makes progress,” Hausmann says. “Just because your dog will do it doesn’t mean that they know it in all circumstances and situations. Training should be fun for you and for your dog. Think of it as a game you play together. If you’re patient and consistent, you should be able to have your dog sit in most situations and environments.”",

Training them to do tricks taps into their instincts and intelligence. Teaching your dog to roll over is a fun, rewarding experience, whether you’ve got a sprightly, springy pup or anolder dog learning new tricks.\nBut teaching your dog to roll over is also about more than tricks. It’s about when your dog looks at you with the “I got this!” gleam in their eyes. It’s about bonding, building trust, and sharing a few laughs when they accidentally turn their first-time roll into a wiggly belly flop.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nCan your pup pull off the classic “roll over” move? Absolutely, with time, patience, enthusiasm, and encouragement. Here’s a breakdown of how to teach your dog to roll over in four simple steps.\nThis simple dog training skill could save your dog’s life.\nUnderstanding the basics of dog training\nAccording to Alisha Kidwell, a veterinarian in North Carolina, “Consistency and positivity are must-haves in creating a strong foundation for training.”\nDog training is like teaching toddlers their ABCs: It requires patience, repetition, and encouragement. Keep your training sessions short (five to 10 minutes). Choose a distraction-free space where your dog can focus. Timing is everything. Trytraining your dogwhen your pup is relaxed but alert, not when they’re “bouncing off the walls” with energy or needing a nap.\nEqually important is using clear, consistent commands and positive reinforcement, such as treats, praise, and their favorite toys. Dogs thrive on routines, patterns, and schedules, so sticking to the same verbal cues, hand signals, and timing will help associate your requests with actions. If you mix up words or gestures, you may confuse your pup, making progress slower and more frustrating for both of you.\nStep-by-step guide to teaching roll over\nThe foundation for rolling over is the “lie down” command. Your dog must master lying on their belly before fully rolling over.\nHold a treat and slowly lower your hand to the ground, holding your dog’s attention while saying, “Lie down.” The command should be clear and firm but positive. Their nose will follow the treat, naturally sinking into position. Once their belly touches the floor, shower them with praise and a treat.\nShow them love and don’t rush into another trick. Praise and positive reinforcement will build their confidence.\nOnce your dog is lying down, it’s time to introduce the side roll. Use a treat again to guide their nose toward their shoulder. Their head will follow, causing their body to shift to the side. When they complete the move, give them a treat and encouragement.\nThis step helps them feel more comfortable with a rolling motion.\nNow for the finale: the roll.\nWith your dog lying on their side, hold the treat near their nose and slowly guide it in an arc over their body. Their head, torso, and hips will naturally follow. Voila! Your pup has rolled over successfully. Celebrate with treats, pets, praise, and excitement.\nRepetition is the secret tosuccessful dog training. Practice the roll-over trick several times daily; keep sessions short to avoid overwhelming your dog. Introduce verbal cues like “roll over” as they get the hang of it. Gradually reduce your reliance on treats once they’ve mastered the move.\nOffering fewer treats can actually be agoodthing.\nTraining tips\nLike people, dogs have good and bad days. Some days, pups are more open to learning; other days, they prefer to be left alone.\nPay attention to their body language — if their tail wags and their eyes are bright, they’re in a good mood and ready to learn. If they seem bored, grumpy, or distracted, call it quits for now.\nTraining shouldn’t feel like a chore for you or your pup — it should be a fun bonding experience. Keep the energy light-hearted and positive by using an enthusiastic, encouraging tone, praise, and playful interactions.\nIf your dog associates training with enjoyment, they’ll look forward to sessions with excitement and a willingness to learn. Incorporate play and rest breaks to keep their spirits high, especially if your dog is starting to lose focus.\nA happy dog learns faster and retains more, making the process smoother and more enjoyable.\nTreats are the ultimate motivator for most dogs. Choose high-value snacks they usually don’t get, like small pieces of rotisserie chicken, cheese cubes, or specialized training sausages. Treats should be small enough to avoid overfeeding but enticing (and delicious) enough to hold their full attention.\nDogs can sense your emotions, so avoid training if you’re having a bad day. Impatience, annoyance, or anxiety can derail their progress. Training should be a positive experience, so focus on celebrating small victories. Patience and a calm demeanor will help build trust and confidence.\nWhenteaching your dog new tricks, think of small steps, not giant leaps. Break the trick into manageable pieces and work one step at a time.\nFor example, if your dog struggles to complete a side roll, focus on building their confidence to encourage a full roll. Build up to the entire motion with positive reinforcements for steps they complete, like lying down.\nHow you end one training session will set the tone for the next. Always finish on a positive note. Pat your pup on the head and make them feel accomplished with praise and a treat. This will get them excited for the next round of training. The goal is to associate training with positivity and fun.\nReferences\nUdell, Monique A. R., and Clive D. L.

This week, Jones pled guilty to over 150-plus charges of theft and animal cruelty, bringing the affected dog parents one step closer to justice for themselves and their pups.\nDuring last year’s investigation, the Miamisburg PD found that 65 different people had been charged a combined total of $200,000, reported2 News. After Jones’s charges became public, more people came forward, and authorities identified a total of 133 different victims. Altogether, Jones is accused of taking $370,000.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nThe charges against Jones\nJones pled guilty to scamming his victims out of thousands of dollars for training services; his criminal charges include theft from the elderly or disabled. He conducted the training on his own property. Instead of returning home well-trained, the dogs would show signs of neglect and malnourishment, with their behavior often worse than before they encountered Jones. Someshowed signs of trauma, including distrust of people, shaking, and hiding.\nOne person who had handed over their dog to Jonestold WHIOthat their pup came back malnourished. “He’d lost a good 15, almost 20 pounds,” she said. Another toldDayton Daily Newsthat he had visited Jones’s property and found his dog staked in a field with a rash; others had their dogs returned to them covered in feces and filth with patches of missing hair.\n“The stories we have heard from victims are maddening and often heartbreaking. The defendant failed to train the dogs, and they were often returned to the owners injured, neglected, and frequently worse in the behaviors the defendant said he could address,” Prosecuting Attorney Mat Hecksaid in a statement.“This defendant should never be allowed to be in the same room as a dog.”\nJones is scheduled to be sentenced on March 14. He is facing thousands of dollars in fines, as well as potential time in prison.\nHow to find a dog trainer you can trust\nJones’s case highlights the importance of thoroughly researching trainers before placing dogs into their care. One way to start a trainer search is by asking for recommendations; you can reach out to friends who have employed trainers, local shelters, or even your veterinarian. Once you’ve found a trainer, you should also ask them for references.\nDog trainer Melissa Dallier advisesseeking out trainers with certain credentials; CPDT-KA, KPA-CTP, CTC, CPDT-KA, CBCC-KA, CDBC, and VSA-CDT are all certifications she recommends looking for.\nBut even if a trainer is certified, Dallier adds that you should ask your trainer questions and look out for red flags. Questions you can ask include:\n“What method of training do you use?”\n“What method of training do you use?”\n“What equipment will you use on/with my dog?”\n“What equipment will you use on/with my dog?”\n“What happens if my dog makes a mistake?”\n“What happens if my dog makes a mistake?”\nLook for a trainer who uses positive reinforcement methods and doesnotuse negative tools, including choke collars and shock collars. Dallier adds that red flags to look for include promising quick changes and guarantees, using language like “alpha” or “dominance,” or focusing on punishment. She notes searching their social media may give you further insight into their methods.\nIf any of their behaviors or answers leave you feeling uneasy, Dallier recommends looking elsewhere.

So manysenior dogs get overlookedat shelters just because they aren’t cuddly little pups anymore. But any dog parent to a senior pup will tell you: Older dogs are awesome.\nBut your dog is unique and has a unique past to match. They come to you with their own set of challenges, triggers, and needs. So, it’s not out of the ordinary that your older pup may come to you needing potty training. Here’s what you need to know.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nCan you train an older dog potty training?\nYes. You can potty train an older dog using similar techniques to how you would potty train a puppy.\nThis is one of my favorite topics. I have first-hand experience of this with my own dog. I adopted an Australian Cattle Dog, a failed farm dog named Boss. Boss spent his first six years of life going to the bathroom wherever he pleased. Not knowing the warmth of a house or a cozy bed, he slept in the stable each night. It took time, patience, and a lot of paper towels, but we did it and so can you.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for helping an adult dog learn to go outside in a new environment.\nChallenges of potty training older dogs\nDepending on the age of your dog, they may have certain cognitive difficulties which could potentially make potty training difficult. Very old dogs maysuffer from doggy dementia, which may limit their ability to learn to be potty trained. If you are adopting a dog from a rescue, they may be able to inform you of this before adoption. It is always a good idea to bring your new dog to the vet as soon as possible to have a full physical to help you determine any possible complications on top of the information you received from the rescue.\nOlder dogs are set in their ways and have developed certain habits, which may not fit your lifestyle that will have to be changed or broken to fit in. Depending on where your adult dog is coming from, they may have never experienced living in a home, or a comfy bed, being on a leash, or using the bathroom at designated times. These are all things you will need to introduce your dog to. Habits can be hard to break, but in most cases this can happen withpositive reinforcement, consistency, and patience.\nHealth issues can be a reason a dog has accidents.  If you bring home a new dog, it is important to bring them to the vet within two weeks of having them home to get a full physical done. This will help you understand any possible health issues and how to help them or if you need to make the difficult decision to return them. If you notice your dog having accidents that are out of the blue, it is best to take them to the vet to see if they have an illness.\nAdult dog potty training steps\nWhen bringing home a new dog, you will want to have a vet picked out prior to bringing them home. It is a good idea to get your new dog seen by your vet within two weeks. This way, your vet has a baseline of the health status for your dog and can rule out any possible illnesses.\nYou willwant to secure an area in your home where your dog can be when you are not home or able to give them your full attention. I recommend anX-penorcrate as a great place for this. Accidents may happen while you are not around, but this will help limit any mess to one confined area. Most dogs will not go poop or pee in a small area that is made for sleeping.\nBegin by building a positive association with the area. Feed your dog their meals, treats, and bones here. After a walk or when you know they are tired put them in the crate or X-pen while you hang out close by. The more comfortable you make this area for them, the better. Be sure to place your dog in here any time you go out or can not watch them even for just a few minutes.\nNext, pick a designated potty area, and make sure you inform anyone who will be walking your dog for pee breaks. Stand in one place and only allow them to walk to the end of the six-foot leash and do a circle around you. Having a tree in the area may help your dog use the bathroom quicker, especially an older dog who likes to mark things. Allowing your dog to sniff everything and pull you when trying to get them to go to the bathroom will create a dog who wants to find the perfect spot to go to the bathroom which can take time. Designating an area teaches your dog to go out to the bathroom right away to get their business done.\nNow, it is time to figure out a schedule that works for you and your dog. Always remember that when potty training an adult dog, you want to take them out shortly after eating, playing, or sleeping. If your dog has frequent accidents, start by taking them out every 45 minutes. Continue to increase the time between potty breaks as you get to know your dog and observe what they do before they need to go.\nBe sure to reward your dog heavily as soon as they finish their business. Use a treat that is easy for them to chew.  You don’t want to use something that is crunchy and takes a long time for them to munch on. It can be helpful to use something extra special that your dog only gets on potty breaks (a piece of a low-sodium turkey dog, freeze-dried raw kibble, liver). This  helps them associate the yummy treat with going pee or poop and hopefully helps speed up the process. Be sure to reward your dog as soon as they finish.\nHow long does it take to potty train an older dog?\nThere is no magic timeline for potty training a dog, especially an older dog. Your dog’s past will also play a role in the timeline, as well as the level of consistency you are willing to give.\nGive your dog four to six months to learn the ropes and get an understanding of using the bathroom outside. It may take up to a year to fully potty train your dog.\nOlder dog training tips\nIf you have a home with more than one exit:Always go out one door for potty breaks. Your dog may begin to stand by the door when they need to go out.\nIf you have a home with more than one exit:Always go out one door for potty breaks.

Allow them to have acomfy bed on the floor, in case jumping on the couch is difficult for them. Senior dogs may take shorter walks than younger dogs, they may tire out sooner or need shorter walks to help protect their joints from hurting.

They will be able to help you understand if the accidents are a medical issue or a potty training issue. If your new dog is peeing in the house it may just be because they are not potty trained. If that is the case, you will want to begin a potty training protocol to help train your dog to go outside.\nReferences\nKelly, Michelle H. “How to Teach an Old Dog New Tricks: Training Techniques for the Adult Learner.”OnePetro, 11 June 2006,onepetro.org/ASSPPDCE/proceedings-abstract/ASSE06/All-ASSE06/32840.

    "page_content": "My dog, Covid, is very protective of me, which is good to an extent. But he won’t even allow my 16-year-old and 20-year-old kids to hug me without getting defensive toward them. I’m not sure if he is just intimidating them or if he will really attack them, but I don’t want to find out. What can I do to prevent this from happening? - Amanda\nThis is a scary problem to have, especially when kids are involved. The truth is, it’s also a hard question to give a straightforward answer to. A lot depends on your dog’s motivation. Is your dog protecting you? Is he resource guarding? Is he in fear of the kids? Observe your dog’s body language while going toward your kids — ishe barking and growling? Is hishair standing on end?\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nIn general, focus on utilizing a “stay” cue in this case, ideally through a barrier like a baby gate — but not something as obstructing as, say, a tall fence. Have the dog do a “stay” cue, then have your kids approach. Give them a hug, move away, and give Covid ahigh-value reward. Repeat this many times. What you’re trying to do is change the dog’s emotional association to people approaching and hugging you. You might want to start with actions smaller than a hug, such as a handshake, or just talking in close proximity.\nAs far as Covid’s behavior toward your children, if it seems truly scary and aggressive, you’ll need to expose him to increasingly challenging versions of the things that stress him out. It seems like this isn’t the only thing that makes Covid wig out. There’s something called a “relaxation protocol” — theKaren Overall Relaxation Protocol— that you can find online. Start with that and have some of the last things you do involve family members approaching for a hug. If there’s true danger, make sure there is space between the family and the dog while doing this.\nSometimes, people train a dog to do a “stay” cue through a barrier, and the dog still reacts when they’re right next to their mom, even if they don’t have a problem from five feet away. In this case, you would have to practice in closer and closer proximity.\nAt that point, while practicing, you might want toconsider a muzzleto make sure we’re keeping everybody safe. Keep in mind that muzzle training is its own separate task — you shouldn’t just slap a muzzle on a dog. You would need to go through muzzle desensitization.The Muzzle Projectis great if you need help doing this. Work on training — the “stay” command and counter conditioning toward family members — while doing muzzle desensitization. Then, as you’re getting closer and closer, you can combine the muzzle and the training protocol.\nIn addition to training your dog out of overprotective behaviors, it can help to understand where this behavior comes from and why your dog may feel so strongly about keeping you safe.\nLearning about dogs’ protective instinct\nMany people love dogs for their loyal behaviors, which go all the way back to their wolf ancestors. Dogs are pack animals, and they consider their human parents part of their pack and will protect you from any perceived threats. While some dogs are more protective than others, all canines have some level of protective instinct and want to keep you safe.\nJust as you consider your dog a part of your family, they consider you a part of their pack. That means your dog won’t stand for anyone who seems to threaten you. Many dogs were bred over time to guard homes and land by alerting owners to anything that seemed out of place, like a stranger or a wild animal.\nThese days, your dog likely doesn’t need to guard your home as intensely, but they will likely still bark to let you know about anything unusual. This is a natural behavior, but your dog should also stay calm and settle down once they understand there’s no real threat.\nUnfortunately, there’s a rather thin line between protection and aggression, and it can be hard to identify the difference. While your dog’s protective instincts come from a place of love, aggression is a result of fear or insecurity and can quickly turn dangerous.\nAn overprotective dog becomes aggressive even when the situation doesn’t call for it and may even try to harm a person or animal who gets near their human. It’s critical that you discourage this behavior if it happens; otherwise, your dog may end up biting or attacking someone.\nSigns that your dog is protecting you\nStudies show that dogsgenuinely care about their human parents and wish to protect them. Your dog’s instinct to keep you safe is natural and even beneficial. Pay attention to your dog’s body language to understand if they’re trying to protect you. Look for signs such as:\nBlocking you from a perceived threat with their body\nBlocking you from a perceived threat with their body\nBarking (at strangers, noises, other animals, or anything they consider out of the ordinary)\nBarking (at strangers, noises, other animals, or anything they consider out of the ordinary)\nGrowling in warning\nGrowling in warning\nStaying vigilant and watching for danger\nStaying vigilant and watching for danger\nWhat causes the overprotection behavior?\nYour dog wants to protect your pack (yes, that meansyou) because a pack is stronger together. Dogs tend to be more watchful over members of the family that they perceive as less able to care for themselves, such as babies and small children.\nHow to fix your dog’s overprotection\nIf your dog shows any overprotective behavior, such as growling or snarling at anyone who approaches you, make sure to address the behavior immediately. These actions can quickly escalate to more aggressive behavior, which can quickly turn dangerous for your family and those around you. Overprotectiveness may manifest differently in different dogs, but look out for aggressivebehavior that is unprovoked, such as showing teeth, barking, snapping, or even biting.\nThe best thing you can do to prevent overly reactive dog behavior is establish a clear daily routine. Dogs thrive on regular schedules, so make sure to stay consistent with training and slowly expose your dog to new people, animals, and situations.\nDogs pick up on their human parents’ moods, so even if your dog acts overly protective, it’s important to stay calm yourself. Even if you feel nervous, do your best not to show it and encourage your dog to approach new situations with calm curiosity.\nWhen out walking your dog or meeting new people, always keep your distance at first. If your dog has a history of aggressive or overprotective behavior, make sure to stay well away from other people and animals to avoid an incident.\nAlways use a leash when introducing your dog to someone new. A leash provides you with control and allows you to pull the dog away if things become testy.\nMost aggressive or overprotective behavior can be prevented with proper socialization and training. Your dog should be socialized with a variety of people, animals, and situations early in their life to help avoid later behavioral issues. And even if you adopt an adult dog, you can still work on socialization and training to help them feel more secure and less likely to lash out.\nA vet’s response to a common overprotective dog question\nKinshipCollective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a stubborn pup to listen up.\nWhile working with a dog behaviorist is key to reducing overprotective behaviors, it’s also important to consult your veterinarian to determine what’s causing these reactions — and what you can do to reduce and prevent the behavior.\nDr. Leslie Sinn, a veterinary behaviorist in Ashburn, Virginia, notes that overprotective behavior in dogs may stem from fear or resource guarding. “If a dog is showing signs of overt/forward aggression, it is serious. For example, stiffing, staring, moving between the owner and the approaching person or dog, growling, barking, and/org lunging are all signs that the dog is struggling.”\nAs with any unwanted behavior,neverpunish your dog for being overly protective. Work on training to ensure that your dog listens to commands like sit and stay. Once your dog has calmed down, reward them with a high-value treat. If your dog continues to act aggressively, keep them away from other people and animals until you have control.\n“Ask for an alternative behavior, such as sit or move behind me, and reward [the dog for their good behavior,” Dr. Sinn says. She also emphasizes the importance of reading your dog’s body language and warning others if your dog is worried or anxious. “Remove the dog from the situation or prevent the situation from occurring in the first place, meaning, if your dog is not social, then don’t take him to the brewery with you!”\nWith patience and consistency, as well as the efforts of a vet and behaviorist, you can work on reducing your dog’s overprotective behaviors and helping them feel more secure with new situations and people.\n“Aggression in Dogs - Territorial.”VCA_corporate, 2012,vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/aggression-in-dogs-territorial.\n“Aggression in Dogs - Territorial.”VCA_corporate, 2012,vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/aggression-in-dogs-territorial.\nHow to Stop Territorial Barking | Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. 15 Apr. 2020,vet.tufts.edu/news-events/news/how-stop-territorial-barking.\nHow to Stop Territorial Barking | Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. 15 Apr. 2020,vet.tufts.edu/news-events/news/how-stop-territorial-barking.\nYes, Your Dog Wants to Rescue You | ASU News.28 May 2020,news.asu.edu/20200528-discoveries-yes-your-dog-wants-rescue-you.\nYes, Your Dog Wants to Rescue You | ASU News.28 May 2020,news.asu.edu/20200528-discoveries-yes-your-dog-wants-rescue-you.",

All dogs have to undergo basic obedience training where they learn commands such as sit, stay, come, and heelwhich costsan average of $1,000-$2,500. Task-specific training can be amore costly endeavor— with basic mobility assistance training ranging from $15,000-$30,000, specialized task training from $25,000 to $40,000, and guide dogs or medical alert dogs up to $50,000.\nThere are options for funding this training, likenonprofit organizations,veterans programs, andscholarships.\nHere’s everything you need to know about ESAs.\nHow to train your own service dog\nFor those who choose to train their own service dogs with professional help, hourly rates typicallyrangefrom $150 to $250, which can add up to several thousand dollars over the course of training.

Unlike service dogs, ESAs are not trained to perform specific tasks related to a disability and do not have the same public access rights as service dogs. However, ESAs are covered under the Fair Housing Act (FHA), allowing them to live with their owners in housing that typically has a \"no pets\" policy.\nAn emotional support animal is a pet prescribed by a licensed mental health professional to provide comfort, companionship, and emotional support to individuals who are dealing with mental health conditions, such as anxiety, depression, or other psychological issues.

While many service dogs wear vests for identification, the vest alone does not signify that a dog is a service dog. Some dogs - like my dog Lucy - wear a vest that says “pet me!” because they are therapy dogs meant to be engaged with. Many service dogs are on the job when they are in a vest, and you arenot supposed to pet themor engage with them. Proper training and task performance are required to qualify a dog as a service dog.\nDefinitely something worth looking into.\nReferences\nWinkle, M., Crowe, T. K., & Hendrix, I. (2012).

This behavior can arise due to many reasons, ranging from attention-seeking, playing, or even separation anxiety.

Why is your pup into socks? From being able to smell your scent, teething, or being bored — we examine all the possibly reasons why.\nThe main reason that dogs steal socks is because they are looking for attention. Shir Limazati, a dog trainer and owner ofAnother Chance Training, explains: “Most often, if a dog steals your socks, it is attention-seeking behavior. The dog wants you to play with them, wants you to stop what you’re doing, and put all focus on them.”\nShe suggests that you schedule time each day to hang out with your pup. “You want to make sure to give your dog plenty of exercise and mental stimulation throughout the day to tire them out and satisfy their needs for attention,” Limazati says. However, do not chase them or say their name and accidentally reinforce the behavior by giving them attention once you’ve discovered them with a sock.\nDogs may see socks as toys. The colors and textures may seem similar to other toys they have, so it can be confusing for a pup. But trying to take a sock away from a pup who is trying to play with it could accidentally reinforce that it’s OK to play with socks. Either wait until they lose interest in the sock and move it elsewhere, or try to redirect your pup to an actual toy.\nDogs have agreat sense of smell, so showing interest in your socks, which are filled to the brim with your signature scent, makes sense. Although it might be an annoying behavior, for your dog it’s a sign that they want to bond with you and that your scent comforts them. Since there’s no way to fully get your scent out of your socks, the best way to keep your dog from getting to them is by putting them in a place (like a drawer) where they can’t reach them.\nIf you have a young puppy who keeps going for your socks, it might be because it’s soothing for themwhile they’re teething. The texture of socks or shoes is perfect for chewing. To help curb this, put socks and shoes where your puppy can’t access them, and make sure they have lots of safe options for teething toys and chews.\nSimply put, yourpup might just be bored, and socks are something that has captured their attention. That’s why it’s important to have a daily routine that’s filled with mental and physical stimulation, walks, and playtime — all of which prevent boredom in puppies.\nIf yourpup misses you, your socks, which are filled with your scent, are the perfect comfort for them while you’re away.\nSock stealing actually harkens back to a dog’s ancestral instincts to collect. Undomesticated dogs would hunt prey and scavenge to collect objects, bringing them back home as trophies. Your pup just might see your socks as a trophy.\nStreetwear brand SparkPaws designs matching hoodies for dogs and dog parents.\nHow do you prevent your dog from stealing your socks?\nOne of the first things to do is make sure your socks are in a place where they can’t be accessed by your pup. That could mean putting them in a drawer, a closed container, a closet, or any other space that your dog can’t access. If they still find a way to access your socks, here are some strategies to discourage your pup from taking them.\nUse positive reinforcement training. Reward good behavior (ie leaving your socks alone and playing with a proper toy), and ignore the naughty behavior.\nUse positive reinforcement training.

If this happens, immediately call your vet. If it’s after hours and your vet is closed, call the nearest 24-hour emergency vet,” Limazati says. “Eating a sock can lead to obstruction. The sooner you call the vet, the better chance there is for them to induce vomiting and avoid potential surgery.”\nWhen to contact a vet for this problem\nContact a vet if your dog too frequently steals socks, especially if they keep eating them. Eating socks can cause all kinds of health issues for dogs, including bowel obstruction, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.",

A puppy can hold their bladder for one hour for every month of their age. So that can give you a good sense of timing when it comes totaking your puppy outsideto relieve themselves. It’s important to watch your puppy to avoid accidents, consider a dog gate to keep them contained, and crate-train them for any time you are out of the apartment.\nIf anything requires patience, it’s this.\nSteps to potty train your puppy in an apartment\nDog trainer Shir Limazati, owner ofAnother Chance Training, knows that it is challenging to potty train a puppy in an apartment, but not impossible. “The quickest way to potty train your puppy is to stick to a consistent schedule. Even if you have limited space in your apartment,” she says, “crate training your puppy can help limit accidents when you can’t pay attention to your puppy.”\nStart by creating a puppy-safe potty spot. Find a spot in your apartment where you can place pee or potty pads, then praise your puppy when they successfully use the pad. If you see that your puppy needs to go to the bathroom, moving them to the pad is another way to establish this as a designated spot for them to go.\nKeeping a routineis very important for both feeding and potty training, since the two are linked. “The best way to potty train is to take your puppy out every two hours — plus within 30 minutes after meals and after heavy play,” Limazati says. “I also recommend staying outside for another five to 10 minutes after your puppy goes, so they don’t [think], ‘The fun is over once I pee or poo.’ This can cause them to hold it, and then have accidents inside.”\nReinforcing where your puppy goes to the bathroom is important for them to understand what “good” behavior is. Give them praise and treats when they successfully go in the correct location. But don’t give them treats until after they go, so they fully empty themself. Limazati adds, “It’s best to reward them right away, rather than when they come back inside, to make sure they understand they are being rewarded for going potty outside — so make sure you take treats with you on your walks.”\nLimazati shares some signs to look for. “When you see signs your puppy has to go — sniffing the floor, circling, squatting — immediately scoop your puppy up and take them outside.  Remember to reward them with a treat once they go outside,” she says. If it’s too late to take them outside, bring them to a pee pad or patio, if you have one.\nIn an apartment, especially if you live in a high rise, getting your puppy outside might take more time than expected. So there’s a chance they may have an accident, either on the way outside or in the apartment. Avoid scolding them, because that will instill fear and mistrust.\n“Accidents during potty training are bound to happen in the beginning. If you come across an accident that has already happened, there’s nothing for you to do besides thoroughly clean and sanitize the sight of the accident,” Limazati says. “Punishing your dog for having that accident does not teach them not to go there. In fact, if the accident already happened, you missed the window of opportunity for any correction to be understood by your puppy.” Be sure to use an enzyme cleaner for indoor accidents, so your pup won’t continue to go in the same spot.\nIf your indoor potty spot isn’t ready yet, or you are trying to focus on outdoor-only training, carry your puppy all the way outside until they are more equipped to hold their bladder.\nYou shouldn’t make them cross their legs for long!\nShould you use pee pads for your puppy?\nPee pads can be helpful for potty training, especially in an apartment. You want to put the pee pad in one place, so your pup will know where to go. If it seems like an accident might be happening, move your puppy to the pee pad so they recognize where they should be going.\nLimazati mentions that, if you have the option, training outdoors is always best. “It’s best to train your puppy to go outside…unless there is a reason you can’t take your puppy out on a schedule — severe weather, your dog (or you) has a medical condition, etc.”\nShould you use puppy litter boxes or grass patches?\nThere are options other than pee pads, such as puppy litter boxes or grass patches that mimic the outdoors. Using either of these is a personal choice, depending on your space, needs, and what your puppy might prefer. However, Limazati says to be sure to know the limitations of these options. “Potty pads and litter boxes can make it tough to travel with your dog. If your dog knows to go outside for their potty needs, you can take them anywhere.”\nFAQs\nPlacing a pee pad near the door might be the best place (depending on your space) to train a puppy to use the bathroom. Your pup will associate going to the bathroom with the front door and going outside, even as they grow older.\nThe fastest way to potty train a puppy is through the following process. Establish a strict routine. Take them outside often (especially after eating or playing). And after they go to the bathroom in a preferred spot, positively reinforce the behavior with praise and treats.",

    },
    "page_content": "You finally did it. After months of scrolling through rescue Instagrams and humane society websites, you’ve adopted the perfect shelter dog. But, uh… now, what?\nWhenbringing home a rescue, it’s crucial to meet them where they’re at and to know that their demeanor might change over time. To learn what behaviors to expect from shelter dogs, we spoke with two experts who offered their best tips to set new pet parents up for success.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nDo shelter dogs have behavior problems?\nIn some circles, shelter dogs have gotten a bad rap for being unruly or even aggressive. While this may be the case for some dogs, rescue or otherwise, it’s often the result of a slow escalation. With the right behavior modification training, we can interrupt these behaviors before they become solidified habits.\nDogs rarely become aggressive, lunge, or bite out of nowhere.  Instead, they usually show theirstress through body languagebefore acting out. No matter where your dog came from, understanding how they communicate will help you better understand their needs and prevent aggressive behavior toward yourself, strangers, and other dogs.\n“As a guardian, knowing how to read your dog’s body language, understanding what aggression escalation looks like, and the various states of canine maturity and what they entail, is so important,” says certified dog behavior consultant andShelter Behavior Integrationsowner Laurie Lawless .\nCertified dog behavior consultant and accredited dog trainerEmily Scottagrees that body language is a crucial “barometer” for gauging your dog’s comfort zone.\nSigns your dog is stressed or scared can include:\nLow, stiff posture\nLow, stiff posture\nShaking or jumpiness\nShaking or jumpiness\nGrowling or snarling\nGrowling or snarling\nExcessivelip-licking\nExcessivelip-licking\nRaised hackles\nRaised hackles\nEars pinned downor pointed forward\nEars pinned downor pointed forward\nTailbetween legs\nTailbetween legs\nWide “whale eyes” or rapid eye movement\nWide “whale eyes” or rapid eye movement\nIf your dog seems anxious, stop whatever you’re doing, and let them retreat to a place that feels safe. Don’t force them to continue the activity that makes them uncomfortable without consulting a professional; that’ll only make things worse.\nEvery dog is different, so their reactions to a new home will naturally vary as well. That said, there are some shared themes.\nScott says it’s common for shelter dogs to be warm and loving toward onlysomemembers of the family. Based on their prior history, they might be skittish around small children, men, or another group. If you notice this, avoid having that family shower your dog with unwanted attention, hugs, and interactions. Instead, let the dog adjust to their presence slowly andinteract when they feel confident.\nYour new dog might also run into some potty issues. “They don’t know where they’re supposed to go in this new setting, so they have accidents,” Scott says.\nThis is especially common during the first day or two, even forpotty trained dogs, Lawless says. “Transition can be challenging, so even simple behaviors can be totally upended.” If your new dog is having accidents, be patient, and remember that these problems are temporary.\nBoundaries, right? But if they end up sleeping in bed, that’s cool, too.\nIt can take months for a dog to begin feeling comfortable, Scott says, and up to a year before they feel truly acclimated to their new routines. However your dog acts when they first come home, there’s a good chance their full personality won’t emerge until after they’ve settled.\n“Some dogs act out right away and then settle in with routine and consistency, and other dogs will suppress behaviors under initial stress and then show more behaviors once they are comfortable,” Lawless says.\nEven dogs that are quiet upon arrival might grow territorial over time, once they realize that your home is also their home. “When they first come into the home, they don’t know it's their property,” Scott says. “...But as they get accustomed to being in this environment and realize,This is my territory, it’s very common tosee the barking come out.”\nIf your dog becomes territorial, try giving them treats when the doorbell rings tocurb their fear and build a positive association. You might also put them in another room to deduce the stress of involving them in the greeting process. If that doesn’t work, consider hiring a trained professional to help.\nIf you notice your dog reacting to a particular situation in a new way more than once — especially if they display fear, anxiety, or aggression — Lawless suggests journaling to track both the behavior and any attempts you make to mitigate it. “If it gets to a point in which you need to reach out for help,” she says, “ trainers will first want to look at behavioral patterns and initial interventions so their training plan can be most effective and efficient from the get go.”\nFour tips for bringing home a shelter dog\nWhen adopting a rescue dog, take these steps for a smoother transition.\nWhenever bringing home a new pet, it’s tempting to start having fun right away. But flooding your dog with new experiences could overwhelm them and make the adjustment period that much harder. “All dogs need time to decompress,” Scott says.\nWhen they first arrive, “most dogs are still kind of traumatized from being in the shelter and foster care, and/or on the streets,” Scott says. “They're still just trying to navigate living in the human world, let alone going to games and concerts and restaurants and dog parks.” That’s why it’s best to “go a lot slower than you think.”\nEarly on, let your new dog negotiate their new environment gradually. Don’t force them to interact with you if they’re not ready, and don’t invite the whole family over to greet them. Once youareable to receive guests, invite one or two at a time. Dissuade visitors from forcing social interactions and let the dog come to them instead.\nIf your dog is scared of the leash, don’t drag them outside anyway; speak with a trainer who can help them overcome that fear. Whatever happens, be compassionate and remember how much new information your dog is processing at once — right down to learning their own name. This is a learning process for both of you.\nBefore you bring your shelter dog home, identify some places where they can safely sleep, sit, and eat.\nPlanning is important, and so is paying attention to how your dog responds to their new set-up. “You may set up a crate, a bed, and a feeding area where you envision the dog would use those items,” Lawless says, “but allowing the dog to choose their preferences as much as possible is very important in allowing them to settle in.”\nIf you’ve set up anew crateon one side of the bed, but your dog actually seems to prefer the other side, consider shifting items around. If you set up your dog’s eating station in the kitchen only to find out that the area intimidates them, try moving the bowl somewhere quieter. The goal is to be both considerateandreceptive to new information as your pet gives it to you.\nLawless and Scott agree that following predictable routines is key. Feed and walk your dog at the same time each day to help them get the lay of the land and build confidence.\nWhatever your dog’sexercise needs might be, find ways to build that activity into your day as well. As Lawless notes, “Dogs who don’t have their physiological needs met will figure out how to do so on their own, and it's definitely not going to be in the way most households will find constructive.”\nIt can also help to limit your dog’s access to certain items and areas in your home while they explore — particularly those that could inspire unwanted behaviors. For example, Lawless notes that many dogs will try to get into garbage cans or steal snacks stored on the kitchen counter. Consider securing those items and using boundaries, like baby gates, to keep your dog at bay. That way, they can learn the house rulesafterthey’ve started feeling safe.\nIf you already have another dog in your home (or a cat, or a bird, or anything else), foster healthy relationships between them by establishing boundaries.\n“If you have a multi-dog household, it’s important to prepare your current dog for both dogs to have their routines changed,” Lawless says. “If you need to make adjustments to furniture or the household, doing that a few days to a week ahead of time can be helpful.”\nSet up a barrier for the first introduction, like a baby gate, to help your dogs get acquainted from a safe distance. Once they seem used to each other and express friendly interest, remove the barrier and let them greet one another up close.\nEven after your dogs start sharing space, keep their eating areas separate to dissuade competition andfood aggression. Similarly, put away any toys or treats that could inspire rivalry; let the dogs get used to one another before slowly reintroducing the toys.\nFor starters:No, they’re not all traumatized andyes, youcanfind a purebred puppy at a shelter.\nHow do I make a behavior modification plan for my shelter dog?\nIf your dog is exhibiting new, unwanted behaviors, a trained specialist can help you overcome them with gentle techniquesbased in positive reinforcement.\nAs defined by theAmerican Animal Hospital Association, behavior modification uses techniques, like rewarding good behavior, to encourage repetition and desensitizing dogs to their triggers through gradual, carefully calculated exposure. Typically, this approach avoids using fear- and punishment-based techniques.\n“Training should start right away,” Scott says. The sooner you start, the smoother the results will be, because habits have had less time to solidify. Lawless agrees: “Don’t wait until something bad happens to get in touch with an expert.”\nReferences\n“Changing Behaviors.”AAHA, 5 Aug. 2024,www.aaha.org/resources/2015-aaha-canine-and-feline-behavior-management-guidelines/changing-behaviors/.",

Puppies bark for a number of reasons, and with a little troubleshooting and some training techniques, you’ll be able to raise a pup with healthy barking habits. Start now because, as many dog parents will tell you,non-stop barkingis one of the hardest behaviors to overcome.\nMain takeaways\nDogs have evolved to bark for a number of reasons.\nDogs have evolved to bark for a number of reasons.\nBoredom, overstimulation, territoriality, and attention-seeking are triggers for barking.\nBoredom, overstimulation, territoriality, and attention-seeking are triggers for barking.\nWith patience and consistency, you can train your puppy not to bark.\nWith patience and consistency, you can train your puppy not to bark.\nThe top five reasons dogs bark—and how to get them to relax a bit.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nUnderstanding why puppies bark\n“Dogs bark at strangers due to their evolutionary roots,” says Colby Julien, an animal behaviorist and dog trainer atGeo-Sniffing, an outdoor scent pod discovery game for dogs. “Wolves howled to establish territory and avoid conflict.”\nIt makes sense then if you’re part of the wolf pack, your puppy will bark to defend you. Keep in mind that some breeds bark more than others. Unfortunately, smaller breeds favored for living in close quarters, such as Corgis, Chihuahuas, and terriers, tend to bark the most.\nUnderstanding triggers for barking\nJulien says puppies will often bark when they’re bored. “First, check if your dog has enough to do,” she says.\nOverstimulation is another reason puppies bark. If puppies get too excited or their environment is over-stimulating, they’ll express their distress — loudly.\n“This is why it’s important to teach puppies to relax and not overwork them,” Julien says. “Have your puppy sit next to you while watching TV or working on a computer. Reward them any time they lie down and relax.”\nPuppies will also bark to get your attention. Because they’re so cute, their parents will unintentionally reward that barking with a cuddle; therefore, attention barking is usually a pet parent’s fault, Julien says. Eye contact, vocalization, or, worse, yelling, ‘rewards’ the barking with attention.\n“Another common mistake is ignoring the barking at first but then giving in out of frustration. This teaches the dog that barking longer works, so they’ll keep at it even more next time. The more you do this, the harder it will be to break it,” Julien says.\nDogs are territorial and have evolved to bark when someone approaches ‘their’ house. Called ‘stranger barking,’ Julien says this behavior is determined by the size of a dog’s ‘bubble,’ or territory. Different dogs have different-sized bubbles. “So this could be someone walking on the sidewalk on their way to school,” she says. “The worst part is this behavior becomes self-reinforcing when barking ‘works’ by making people continue walking away.”\nHow to train your puppy not to bark\nPositive reinforcement trainingcan be used if barking or other unwanted behaviors arise at any age. When your pup is barking, take a deep breath and wait for the barking to stop. This may take a while, so be patient. As agonizing as it is to ignore a barking puppy, try to wait for even a short pause in the barking. When your pup exhibits the desired behavior — in this case, they stop barking — immediately reward them with a treat. Eventually, they learn that notbarking brings good things.\nWhen they’ve mastered this skill, lengthen the time between when they stop barking and when you give them a treat. As they get better at recognizing the benefits of positive reinforcement, make it fun by varying the amount of time before you give them the treat.\nWhen your pup enters adolescence at around six months, they may startgetting sassyand barking more. Like adolescents of another species, they’re testing boundaries. They might begin noticing people walking by the window or even the sound of a neighbor’s footfalls in the apartment next door.\nTake advantage of your puppy’s energy and capacity for learning to teach the quiet command (your neighbors will thank you). When your puppy starts barking, say “Quiet!” once in a strong, friendly voice. Then, without repeating the command, wait until they stop barking and immediately shower them with praise and treats.\nAs with positive reinforcement, once your pup understands the quiet command, gradually lengthen the amount of time from when they stop barking to when you reward them. Initially this should be just a few seconds. Eventually, issue the rewards intermittently but consistently so they understand that they’ll be rewarded every other time or every third time, but not all the time.\nTime-outs remove your puppy from what they want most: you. Your timing is essential to effective time-outs. The second your puppy starts barking, remove yourself from the room and close the door, or remove your puppy to a crate or confined space. Be consistent and do this every time they start barking. If not, you’ll confuse your pup. You may need to set aside a day to enact numerous time-outs, but eventually, your puppy will learn that barking leads you to withdraw your attention.\nStart by leaving your dog alone for a short time, maybe 30 seconds. Increase the time gradually by increments. Continue using positive reinforcement techniques; as soon as you hear the barking stop, return to your puppy and reward them. If you don’t, they won’t learn the cause and effect of time-outs.\nWhile your puppy is in time-out, stay nearby but out of sight. If the barking continues for several minutes, you can step into sight, which may precipitate a surprised pause in the barking. Immediately reward your puppy by releasing them from the room or the crate. If the barking resumes (and it will at first), repeat the process.\nIf your puppy starts barking while confined to a crate or a room, try not to let them out until they’ve stopped barking, even for a second, then reward them with a treat or a puzzle toy. The best strategy for keeping your pup quiet during downtime is to tire them out before you put them in the crate.\nJulien says redirecting your puppy while they’re barking is difficult because they’ll most likely ignore what you offer. Managing the environment is key: Block the view with curtains and move the chair or couch they’re climbing on to look out the window. Julien also suggests playing background noise, such as YouTube videos of kids playing, to desensitize your puppy to common sounds in their environment.\nWhat’s more, a tired puppy is a quiet puppy. Exercise is one of the most effective methods for keeping your pup quiet. A tiring walk or long-lasting treats such a Kong stuffed with peanut butter or a puzzle toy will occupy your pup and keep them from barking at times when you need quiet.\nWhen should you seek professional help from a trainer?\nOften, when your puppy barks, they’re too excited to pay attention to you. In this case, Julien says to schedule a training session to work on impulse control games so your dog learns the necessary skills to calm down after they get triggered.\nA trainer can also help you design a program of games, obedience training, tricks, and agility exercises to keep boredom barking from turning into destructive behavior. “Working dogs like Border Collies will become anxious from lack of stimulation and will find any way to fulfill the need for stimulation. Barking is the least of your problems with a bored dog. Destructive behaviors are sure to follow,” Julien says.\nYoucanlive in a quiet house again.\nWhat Is the three-bark rule?\nBarking is a communication tool puppies use to convey how they’re feeling and get our attention. We don’t want to communicate to them that what they’re feeling isn’t important, which is where the “three-bark rule” comes in. This dog-training method allows the dog to bark up to three times to alert their parents about someone at the door, for example. After three barks, apply the quiet command or reward them when they stop barking.\nReferences\n“How to Stop Territorial Barking | Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine.”Vet.tufts.edu,vet.tufts.edu/news-events/news/how-stop-territorial-barking.\n“How to Stop Territorial Barking | Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine.”Vet.tufts.edu,vet.tufts.edu/news-events/news/how-stop-territorial-barking.",

    "page_content": "Think of the things you do for that perfect cup of coffee — like walking entirely out of your way on your morning commute to the one barista who has mastered your latte. So just imagine what tricks you can inspire your puppy to learn with just the right reward. There’s a reason why “food motivated” is a term you’ve probably heard vets and trainers use. Praise and belly rubs are great, to be sure, butnothing beats treats. That said, it’s not as simple as dangling a carrot. Certified dog behavioristLauren Novackbreaks down how to pick the perfect dog training treat. Shop our top picks below.\nWhat makes a good treat for dog training?\nThe point of a training treat is to motivate your puppy to give you their undivided attention, so it makes sense that the treat should be more desirable to your dog than any other stimuli (squirrels, shoes, other puppies). If your pup is very food motivated, then this is an easy one. But some can be picky eaters, in which case you’ll need to up the ante. Novack suggests categorizing treats into three categories: low, medium, and high value.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhen working on a dog-training skill that your dog knows pretty well, go for low-value treats. Low-value treats can be your dog’s kibble. “They eat it a lot already, and while it tastes good, it’s only going to be motivating in reinforcing behaviors they’ve already got down pretty well,” Novack says. Because treats should make upno more than 10 percentof your dog’s daily calories, this option is best for dogs who will eatanythingand dogs who are watching their weight because kibble is lower in calories than most treats.\nThe key to curbing mindless snacking — this is for your dog.\nMedium-value treats are a step up. From classic crunchy dog biscuits to healthy snacks, such as apple slices and baby carrots, medium-value treats are great for training when your dog needs a little extra encouragement, or just to mix it up. You’d be hard-pressed to find a dog who would turn one down; they just may not do backflips for it.\nBut when training your dog to perform a new skill, you need to pull out all the stops. Small, strong-smelling, easily-servable high-value rewards are the best dog training treats. High-value treats are generally meaty…and stinky. They should make your dog drool. Dogs experience the world through their noses — 33 percent of a dog’s brain is dedicated to interpreting odors — so the smellier the treat, the better.\nFlavors like bacon and venison are particularly pungent and covetable. As a rule, dog training treats should be pea-sized and easily portable, so they don’t take your dog ages to chew (or crumble up in your pocket). But if your dog is prone to distraction, you’ll have better luck with human snacks like hot dogs or cheese.\n“Dog parents and trainers need to find a balance between high value treats while also being conscious of the dog’s health,” says Sean Prichard, canine fitness coach and president ofPant & Wag. “Many treats are void of nutrition and loaded with calories and sugar, which is detrimental to a dog's fitness level.” In some cases, however, it’s OK to reward your dog with a salty, delicious and calorie-laden human treat, like a hot dog.\nHere’s your guide to how treats can help as your new pup is learning all the things.\n“If you have a dog that’s overly excited, wants to greeteveryone, and you’re fighting to get their attention, then yeah, you should try hot dogs — break them up before a training session so you’ve got small pieces on hand,” Novack says. “And remember, just like us, dogs tire of the same treats if they’re given often enough. The more variety you can provide your pup, the more interested they will be in learning new things.”\nWhile pea-sized pieces of hot dogs, cheese, liver and dried chicken hearts (a fave of dog behavior consultant Ali Smith, founder ofRebarkable) make good high-value treats, you can also order a supply of ready-made, mouth-watering (for your pup, that is) treats to save yourself some prepping and chopping time. Below, you’ll find some of the best dog-training treats with proven results.\nBtw, our editors (and their pets) picked out these products. They’re always in stock at the time we publish, but there’s a chance they’ll sell out. If you do buy through our links, we may earn a commission. (We’ve got a lot of toys to buy over here, you know?)\nThe best dog training treats\nBocce’s Bakery treats are a great training option for all pups because they are a low-calorie choice (only four calories!) and are made of 100 percent natural ingredients. They are small and easy to fit in a pocket or treat pouch. You can always have these on the go for anytraining opportunity(you never know when one will pop up).\nThis brand started in a tiny kitchen in New York City’s West Village with, you guessed it, a pup named Bocce, whose mom baked him homemade treats when her vet said he needed to lose weight. Rude! Turns out she was onto something, and the brand quickly gained popularity for its limited ingredient recipes like Beef Bourguignon, Burgers and Fries, and Pumpk’n Spice. No, it’s not weird that your mouth is watering. Imagine how well it will motivate your pup!\nWomen Owned\nGives Back\nBest training treats for puppies\nWelcoming a new puppy into your home is an exciting — and often exhausting — time. The last thing you want to be doing is boiling and chopping hot dogs. Besides, you’ll likely beputting in a lot of training hours, so it’s a good idea to go easy on the high-value human treats. Try these store-bought snacks that are perfect for puppies.\nThese bite-sized treats are chewy and low in calories, so they especially come in handy when you’re teaching your dog a trick that requires near-constant treating, such as “heel.”  Real meat (lamb, salmon, or pork) is the first ingredient, plus DHA and EPA are added to support your pup’s brain development so they retain what you teach them. They’re also not just for puppies — they’re perfect for training adult dogs, too, without worrying that they’ll pack on the pounds in a single training session.\nThese grain-free treats are very meaty (stinky), which is perfect for training a puppy who is easily distracted — they won’t be able to resist them and will have your undivided attention. They also boast superfoods, likeblueberriesandsweet potato. They’re pretty small but can be broken into even smaller pieces for tiny pups. They also have 30,000 five-star reviews on Amazon.\nSustainable\nBest training treats for small dogs\nA training treat should always be small, so your dog can gulp it down quickly and get on with training time. But when you’ve got a pint-sized pup, you want to make sure their training treats are tiny, too. Try these small, soft treats when you’re teaching your friend the ways of the world — and don’t forget to teach themhow to take treats gently, while you’re at it.\nChicken liver is the first ingredient in these treats, which are specifically made for small dogs. They’re soft and chewy — and only three calories each, so you don’t need to worry about going overboard with thepositive reinforcementwhen your pup isthe very bestpup. They’re also free of gluten, soy, and added rendered fat.\nGives Back\nBest training treats for medium dogs\nWhen your dog is not too small, not too big, butjust-rightsized, they can do well with pretty much any type of treat. Like a middle child, a medium-sized pup is generally easy to please and goes with the flow (at least when it comes to treats). A freeze-dried raw meat treat makes a nice high-value reward for medium dogs (or for any dog, really).\nThese treats are made from 100 percent raw, freeze-dried meat, with nothing artificial added. Not only does that make them delicious for your dog, it means they’re safe for sensitive stomachs. They also come in beef and lamb varieties, if you feel like mixing it up.\nSustainable\nBest training treats for large dogs\nJust because your dog is big doesn’t mean they need a bigger training treat. (Sorry, Beethoven.) Pea-size is still the way to go, no matter how hearty your large dog’s appetite. That said, a big dog can probably handle a treat that’s on the crunchier or chewier side, as long as theyhave any dental issuesthat make it difficult to chew.\n“My dog goes nuts for these, really nuts,” writes one Amazon reviewer of these treats, which look like mini grilled steaks. Beef is the first ingredient and potatoes are the second, so your big dog gets a hearty meat-and-potatoes experience when they do what you’re asking them to do (like the classic, “leave it!”).\nGives Back\nBest healthy training treats for dogs\nSure, you want your dog to learn how to sit, stay, heel and all the rest — but not at the expense of their health. A healthy training treat can still be a yummy, high-value training treat. In fact, you might find your pup prefers a treat that’s made without fillers and artificial flavors. “Lots of people believe dogs prefer highly processed treats, but usually that’s not the case,” Smith says.\nMade from 100 percent freeze-dried, grass-fed beef liver, these treats are packed with vitamin D and calcium, as well as essential fatty acids that keep your pup’s skin and coat positively gleaming. They’re grain-free, gluten-free, do not contain GMOs and are a great choice if yourpup is on a raw diet(or even if they’re not).\nSmall Business\nBest low-calorie training treats for dogs\nIf your pup is watching their weight — or rather, you’re watching it for them — they can still have treats. Plenty of training treats are low in calories, so you can reward all your dog’s good behavior withoutgetting a stern talking-toat your next vet visit.\nAvailable in a range of flavors, from apple bacon to watermelon (you read that right), these dog treats are just three calories per treat and do not contain gluten, corn, soy, or artificial flavors or colors. They’re packed with antioxidants, vitamins, and fiber and are made in a certified organic facility. And while not every dog will be a fan of every low-calorie treat (or every treat, period), great customer reviews from pet parents — especially for the apple bacon flavor — make this a good one to try.\nBest soft training treats for dogs\nWhether you’ve got a senior dog who can’t chew as well as they once could or a teething puppy who hasn’t quite mastered crunching yet, soft training treats come in a plethora of flavors that will delight your dog without causing dental distress. Here’s one to try.\nThese treats look like littlegingerbread people, which are pretty cute even if your dog couldn’t care less. They come in a variety of flavors, all of which are free of artificial flavors, fillers, and colors. They’ve been baked in the US for over 20 years and are Amazon’s Choice for soft dog treats, favored by puppies and senior dogs (who may have sensitive teeth) alike.\nWomen Owned\nFAQs (People also ask):\nDoes your pup have tummy trouble? Not to worry. There are many training treats for dogs with sensitive stomachs. Look for treats that are free of grains, gluten, and other ingredients likely to upset your dog’s digestive tract. Read the label to make sure the treats don’t contain anything you know spells trouble for your dog — just because a product is labeled as being suitable for sensitive stomachs doesn’t mean it will work for every pup (though it’s a good start).\nThese extra tiny treats are grain free, gluten free, and less than four calories each, so they’re safe for dogs with sensitive stomachs. Flavors like bacon, chicken, and peanut butter will get your pup sitting and shaking and rolling over in no time.\nSustainable\nWhile treats are certainly a huge help with training, they’re best used in combination with other methods. “Treats should be just one tool in your training toolbox,” Prichard says. “A well-rounded training approach includes a mix of positive reinforcement including treats and verbal praise, exercise, and socialization.”\n“For food motivated dogs, the easiest and best reward is usually a treat,” Prichard says. If you don’t want to use store-bought treats, that’s fine of course — you can chop up hot dogs, cheese, or other meats into pea-sized portions, or try your hand at making homemade dog treats for training.\nHeaded to the park with your pup for a training session and don’t want to put dog treats directly in your pocket? Instead of using a sandwich bag or hauling the whole container of treats along with you, pick up a treat pouch for dog training. Designed specifically for this purpose, some will also hold poop bags, making them a must-bring on all your dog walks.\nThis affordable pouch makes life as a dog parent easier for multiple reasons. Not only does it hold treats, it has a built-in poop bag dispenser and pockets for a clicker (another training essential) and your keys or other small essentials. The lining is easy to clean and the exterior is weatherproof, so you can take it out in any weather. Wear it over your shoulder, fasten it around your waist or clip it to your belt loop and you’re in business.\nSmall Business\nAbsolutely. There are plenty of recipes for homemade dog treats,including this onefrom chef Dan Churchill that calls for just three ingredients: dates, oats, and peanut butter.",

    "page_content": "Bringing home a puppy is one of the most exciting things you’ll ever do, but it does come withfewresponsibilities from the start. One of those big hurdles is potty training. It seems like a big task, but it’s one that you will need to take day by day, which only makes things easier.\nHere’s everything you need to know about potty training your new puppy.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nTips you’ll want to pay attention to.\nAverage time to potty train a puppy\nPotty training a puppy typically takes between four to six months, though some puppies may take up to a year to be fully trained. Consistency, positive reinforcement, and patience are key factors in the training process.\nPotty training a puppy can be a daunting task, and you must be ready for the challenge. To potty train a puppy be prepared to be consistent and patient. Just like every human is different, so is every puppy, so there is no set “amount of time” it will take you to potty train your puppy. You can do a few things to ensure potty training goes off without a hitch and is as stress-free as possible for you and your puppy.\nFactors that affect how long potty training takes\nIt’s important to know that the younger the puppy you have, the more frequently you will need to take them out. You may also need to start with frequent potty breaks. Typically, a puppy can hold their bladder for the number of months they are plus one (a three-month-old dog should be able to hold it for four hours, if sleeping or during a time of low stimulation).\nThis rule does not apply when your puppy is up and about moving and grooving. While your dog is learning the rules of potty training, be sure to take them out immediately after they have eaten, played, or have woken from a nap. If you do that, you will easily prevent several accidents over the day.\nWhen beginning your training journey, be sure to pick a pee spot; this is important because it builds consistency and helps your dog understand when you go to this spot outside, they pee. If you take your puppy out to go to the bathroom and allow them to pick their own spot, you will create a bad habit. Your puppy will have to find the “perfect spot” to do their thing.\nAt times, this can cause your puppy to take a long time to actually go, and this causes a problem when you are in a rush to leave. By selecting a specific potty spot, your puppy will learn:When my parents bring me here I need to pee.\nHere’s a schedule you can follow, depending on the situation (if you’re at home or leaving the puppy on their own):\nHow to train a puppy fast\nOnce you have your potty spot picked, it is helpful to get on a schedule (on top of taking your puppy out every time they eat, wake up, and play, etc.). Depending on the age of your puppy, you will want to start by taking them out every 30 minutes to an hour. When your puppy pees in their designated potty spot, reward them with a yummy treat.\nSet a timer each time you go back inside; this will help keep consistency with your schedule. Puppies learn best when they fall into a successful loop: The more potty breaks you catch outside and reward for, the faster your puppy will begin to understand. As your puppy becomes more successful you can increase the time between each potty break. The fewer accidents your dog has the faster potty training will go for you and your pup.\nYou shouldn’t make them cross their legs for long!\nPotty training techniques and tools\nDid you know you can teach your dog to use the bathroom on cue? Each time your puppy pees, say, “Go potty.” Repeat this cue as soon as your puppy starts peeing, and repeat it a few times while they are going, do this for a few weeks. As you get to know your puppy, you will get familiar with what they do right before they pee. Once you know the precursor you can say, “Go potty” before they start. Over time, you will be able to walk to the potty spot, say, “Go potty,” and your dog will automatically go.\nSo, what should you do if your puppy has an accident? Accidents are bound to happen. How you handle them will make or break potty training for your puppy.  Never scold your puppy for having an accident. When you yell or get angry with your puppy if they have an accident, you are not teaching them to not pee in the house. When you yell at your puppy for an accident, they think you are yelling at them for peeing or pooping in general.\nThis will result in a puppy who still has accidents in the house but hides them from you. When your dog has an accident, don’t make a big deal about it; just nonchalantly go over and clean it up. It can be helpful to crate your puppy when you can’t watch them; puppies do not typically like to soil the area they sleep in. So, if you need a minute, just put your puppy in their crate. That way, an accident won’t happen when you are busy. If you catch your dog mid-urination in the house, try to calmly interrupt them and get them outside ASAP to finish their business, remembering not to get frustrated with them.\nThe size of your dog can also play a part in how quickly your puppy potty trains.  The smaller the dog, the smaller the bladder. If a small dog is drinking a lot of water, they may need to use the bathroom more often which could cause more accidents when they are first learning.\nNow that you have all of this information, it is time to put it to the test. Remember the key to easy potty training is: more successful attempts than accidents, yummy treats, timing, and consistency.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nFAQs\nYou should start unofficially potty training your puppy as soon as you bring them home. Puppies under 10 weeks old can’t typically hold their bladder for longer than 30 minutes, so they need to go outside when they wake up, when they eat, after they drink, after they play, etc.\nWhile pee pads are a good idea to have around an apartment in case of an accident, it’s still best to take your pup out as often as possible to get them used to the fact that they pee outside. While this may be annoying in a walk-up, remember these frequent trips won’t be forever.\nA helpful trick to teach your dog when potty training is ringing a bell. You can train your dog to ring a bell when they need to use the bathroom. This is very helpful as you and dog will be able to “communicate.” Just be sure not to let your dog abuse the privilege of ringing the bell to go outside and play.",

Cats and dogs are both very different and have their own unique body language and methods of communication. By understanding these, you can start to support them in having relationships with each other.\nLeeAnna Buis, a certified feline behavior specialist, says it’s important to use safety precautions. “You can't be sure your dog's prey drive won't be triggered by a cat. And a scared cat can get very intense and aggressive with your dog. This can put your dog in a position to defend themselves,” she says. “It can be dangerous on both sides. Until you have a clear picture of how they're reacting to each other, use things like gates and harnesses for added safety.”\nThis is a very complicated topic with a lot of nuance, but we can offer a basic overview of dog and cat body language, and what you should look out for when introducing dogs and cats.\nIf a dog is happy, they tend to stand in a relaxed stance and wag their tail.

If a cat is stressed, they may arch their back and have a stiff posture.\nThere’s a reason why we say that people are “fighting like cats and dogs” – cats and dogs not getting along is a major stereotype. However, most dogs actually can live peacefully with cats.\n“When introduced slowly and positively, with both feeling safe and secure, dogs and cats can have a wonderful relationship, or at least learn to peacefully co-exist,” Buis says. Both cats and dogs are very territorial, but once you bypass those territorial instincts and get them to trust each other, they can actually get along and live peacefully together.\nHow to introduce a dog and cat successfully\nIf you’re looking to introduce a dog and a cat, either to live together or just for a brief period, there are many things you can do to make it an easier process. “A slow, positive introduction that avoids pushing either pet past their comfort zone is best,” Buis says. Here’s our guide for introducing dogs and cats.\nDon’t bring a cat and dog together immediately, and expect them to get along. Keep them separate at first, in different parts of the house that they feel comfortable in. You can do this for several days, or at least until both pets have had their health check ups and you can be certain that they aren’t going to give each other any diseases.\nAfter keeping them separate for a while, the next step is rotating a cat and dog through the house and allowing them to get used to new sounds and scents. You can do this while they’re still separated by keeping them in different spaces in the house and cycling them around to get familiar with the sounds and scents of the other animal.\nNext, you need to get the pets to see each other. You can try showing them the other animal from a distance or through a glass door, allowing them to figure each other out and start desensitizing them both. You can also try feeding them on either side of a closed door to get them used to the smell and sound of the other one eating and to make them feel more comfortable.\nOne of the last steps in introducing a dog and a cat is making leashed introductions. Cats are rarely a threat to a dog, but they may be aggressive or lash out if they feel cornered or harassed. Try introducing your cat and dog with the dog on a leash in a space with enough room for your cat to run away and hide if that is what they want to do.\nKeep an eye on that all-important body language. If your dog lunges at the cat or seems obsessively interested in the cat, you need to distract the dog and try to desensitize them to the cat’s presence.\nIf both the dog and cat have good, calm, happy body language, after a few sessions of leashed introductions you can start to decrease supervision and transition to leaving them alone together. First, try letting your dog off the leash in the same space as the cat, working up to leaving them truly alone for a longer amount of time. This may be a longer process than the other steps.\nIf you are leaving the house, you should still separate the animals in different rooms, possibly indefinitely.\nFAQs\nHow long it takes a cat to get used to a dog in their space varies wildly depending on many factors, including “the cat's history with dogs and vice versa, how they're introduced, the stress level of each pet, their natural state of nervousness or confidence,” Buis says. A cat could accept a dog in their home immediately, or it could take as long as several months.\nBuis adds that, even if things seem like they’re not going well, it is possible to make things work out. “Luckily, with the help of a certified feline training and behavior consultant or certified dog trainer, these don't have to be obstacles. There are ways to work on cat and dog relationships,” she says. Don’t give up, and if you’re struggling to get them used to each other, you should bring a trainer or other expert into the mix for extra support.\nIf you’re trying to get a cat and a dog to accept each other in their space, there are lots of things you shouldn’t do. Don’t rush the introduction, don’t force them into each other’s personal bubble, don’t introduce them in an unfamiliar environment, anddoalways consider the cat and dog’s unique personalities. Every animal is different, and you should always bear this in mind when introducing any animals.\nIf you’re trying to introduce a cat into the home and get your dog to accept a new cat, just follow our guide, and with some time and patience, they should start to accept and understand each other.",

      "source": "https://www.kinship.com/pet-behavior/air-jail"
    },
    "page_content": "Have you ever picked up your dog or cat and held them in the air to stop them from doing something you don’t want them to do?  If so, you may have put them in “air jail” without knowing it. “Air jail” is a cute term for something that many pet parents will recognize: just grabbing your pet and holding them.\nWe tend to do it more often when we get worried about our pets’ behavior, like when they’re interacting with another animal and don’t seem happy. As you can see from thisReddit thread, there is no size limit for pets in air jail. While it seems harmless, there may be some issues with resorting to air jail.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nSo, does air jailwork?\nAs many pet owners know, if you grab your pet while they’re doing something naughty like humping your leg or chewing the sofa, they do kinda freeze and stop what they’re doing.Certified Dog Behavior ConsultantKellie Stevens says that whether or not it “works” depends on what your definition of “working” is. “Can it stop or prevent a dog from doing something in the moment? Yes. Does it teach them a different behavior to do instead? No. Can it cause worse issues in the long run? Big yes,” Stevens warns.\nWhat are some of the issues with air jail?\nMost of all, Stevens says, air jail doesn’t actually teach your pet anything other than “this behavior leads to being picked up.” Your pet may even like being picked up, which hardly discourages them from the behavior. “Most people want the behavior to stop for the long run, and air jail is really just a momentary pause,” she adds. She goes on to add that, depending on the situation, a dog could even find it punishing. “They associate you picking them up with the fun ending, which can lead to them avoiding you or refusing to come back when called next time, or being picked up in other situations, including emergencies,” Stevens says.This can even lead to your pet becoming defensive over time. “This behavior could look like hiding, growling, snapping or even biting when you attempt to pick them up,” Stevens says. “If you're using ‘air jail’ when a dog is reacting to something they're afraid of, reaching out to pick them up could also lead to a redirected bite while they're in an overstimulated headspace.”\nAre there any more serious problems that can be caused by air jail?\nOverall, air jail doesn’t tend to hurt your dog. They may even like to be picked up generally, so it might seem to you like a reassuring or even enjoyable action. However, per Stevens, there are many potential serious concerns caused by relying on air jail. “One issue most people aren’t aware of when picking their dogs up during a situation like an off-leash dog running over is that picking the dog up can actually just raise the target, so now you have a dog jumping up on you to try to get to the dog in your hands,” she says. “If that turns into a fight, now the fight is literally in yourarms and face. It can be dangerous.”\nWe tend to pick up very small dogs more often, which Stevens says can lead to them feeling defensive about being handled or picked up. By taking away their agency and freedom of choice, it can make them feel embarrassed, too: “By picking them up in any situation that makes us uncomfortable or embarrassed. Rather than teaching a behavior we’d rather see, we end up teaching them that being picked up sucks and to avoid it by any means, even using their teeth.”\nAre there any situations where you should pick your pet up?\nWhile air jail isn’t the best thing to fall back on, Stevens says that there are some situations where there is literally no choice but to pick up your dog: “If you’re in an emergency situation, and you can pick your dog up to protect them, that's understandable, and something that doesn’t happen often.” However, especially when it comes to dog-dog interactions, you need to make sure it’s a true emergency, and that you aren’t just being fearful or reactive. The more twitchy you are, the more your dog will pick up on it.\nBut what about cats?\nPeople primarily think about dogs when it comes to “air jail,” but there are some cat owners who will choose this method to control their behavior. Dogs and cats have very different personalities overall, and cats tend to be more resistant to being held at all.\nAccordingto experts, it’s not a great idea–least of all because you don’t want to get scratched. One vet toldNewsweek:“Most cats don’t like it. All cats are individuals, and there may be the occasional goofy kitten who tolerates or even likes being held up in the air; however, while it may seem harmless to us, this is not a safe or comfortable position for most cats.” She went on to say that it could even harm your bond with your cat.\nWhat are some alternatives to air jail?\nIf you tend to fall back on air jail for your pets in the moment, you might need to revisit your training regimen overall. Stevens says that the best thing to do is teach your pet to walk away from scary or exciting things on cue. “This is a great alternative that doesn’t involve having to touch them, and it gets them space from that thing so their brains can cool off and return to thinking/learning state rather than a reacting/surviving state,” she says.\nTaking it one step further, Stevens adds that “you can play pattern games with them to create predictability in an unpredictable situation if they’re reacting to something that makes them anxious. You can teach them more appropriate social behavior if it’s a situation like dog-dog greetings or interactions.”\nIf you really need to pick your dog up for some reason, says Stevens, you can teach them in advance how to opt into behavior on cue and practice in the situations that you tend to find yourself picking your dog up. All pets are different, but while your dog might seem to tolerate air jail, overall it’s not the most effective way to stop them from engaging in unwanted behaviors.\nReferences\nVolpe, Maria Azzurra. “Cat Owner Claps Back at Criticism of How He Holds Orange Boy: “Air Jail.””Newsweek, 14 Oct. 2024,www.newsweek.com/cat-owner-claps-back-criticism-how-he-holds-orange-boy-air-jail-1968489.

    "page_content": "If you have a pet of any kind, it’s likely that you turn to them every day for different kinds of emotional support. However, there is a difference between an officialemotional support animal(ESA) and your very understanding Labrador. Here’s everything you need to know about ESAs.\nMain takeaways\nAny animal can be an ESA, but dogs are the most common ESAs.\nAny animal can be an ESA, but dogs are the most common ESAs.\nESAs are not the same as service animals.\nESAs are not the same as service animals.\nESAs can support their pet parents through any number of different mental health issues and crises.\nESAs can support their pet parents through any number of different mental health issues and crises.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat exactly are emotional support animals?\nAn emotional support animal is a pet that provides comfort, companionship, and emotional support to individuals who are dealing with mental health conditions, such as anxiety, depression, or other psychological issues.\nAn ESA is a pet that is prescribedby a licensed mental health professional to a person with debilitating mental illness. They may also receive special training to ensure that they can provide support. Animal-assisted Psychotherapist Braquelle Murphy puts it simply: “An ESA comforts someone with a mental health disorder and can provide support during a crisis.”\nAn ESA has many purposes that extend beyond the usual expectations of a pet. If their pet parent has anxiety, for example, an ESA may have ways of distracting their parent from an impending panic attack. They may also be able to alleviate the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, and more.\nConfused about ESA rules? Here’s a comprehensive guide that explains everything.\nHistory of support animals\nThe path to recognition for ESAs has a long, complicated history. Even today, many people struggle to get their need for their ESA recognized and may be denied entry to certain places with their ESA.\nWhile animals have beenused in therapyfor a long time, it is only relatively recently that ESAs have been recognized as a separate category.\nESAs still do not have much recognition under the law.\nLegal definition\nThe definition of an ESA is simple: an animal who provides emotional support to a person with a mental health difficulty or disorder. However, as they are not protected under theAmericans with Disabilities Act(ADA), there is no set legal definition of an ESA. The only requirement is that they are prescribed by a mental health professional.\nRights and protections under the law\nEven today, ESAs are not protected under the ADA or theAir Carrier Access Act(ACAA). However, an ESA is protected under the Fair Housing Act (FHA), granting the parent the ability to have the ESA in their home, even where they otherwise would not be allowed.\nDocumentation and certification\nIf you have an ESA, you should have paperwork from your mental health professional proving they are essential to your mental health. You will only need to produce this in situations such as applying for housing, as you cannot take an ESA everywhere that you could take a service animal. Your animal does not need to wear any particular tags or clothing to identify them as an ESA.\nDifference between emotional support animals and other types of animals\nThere are many differences between ESAs and other service animals, but the main differences regard the legal protections and requirements of these animals.\n“Service dogs are protected under the ADA and the ACAA to enter certain public spaces, private residences, and public transportation,” Murphy says. “Service dogs help someone with a disability accomplish a task, while an ESA solely comforts someone with a mental health disorder.”\nAdditionally, there are no federal laws that require ESAs to complete any training. “To become an ESA, a licensed mental health professional needs to write an ESA letter that states that the handler would benefit from an ESA,” Murphy says. On the other hand, service animals go through rigorous training to support a person with a disability, and they require extensive documentation.\nWhile it may seem like an ESA and a therapy animal are the same, there are some differences. While an ESA is trained to live with and support a specific person, therapy dogs volunteer in clinical settings. This may include mental health institutions, hospices, hospitals, nursing homes, and other places where people need additional comfort and emotional nourishment. Therapy dogs tend to be calm and remain unbothered in stressful situations.\nWhile all of our pets provide emotional support through the nature of their existence, Emotional Support Animals are very different from pets. Instead of providing general reassurance, they are trained to reassure a specific person through the symptoms of their emotional distress.\nBenefits of emotional support animals\nThere aremany benefitsto having an ESA beyond emotional support.\nESAs are, of course, particularly beneficial for people who have serious mental health conditions, but also have other psychological benefits. “ESAs can provide companionship, support in social situations, comfort during times of distress, and add a sense of purpose and meaning in the person’s life,” Murphy says.\nESAs can also support their parent’s physical health, particularly if they have a mental health condition that makes it difficult to get outside. If their parent is anxious or agoraphobic, the ESA can provide a reason for them to get out and exercise while providing emotional support.\nAdditionally, ESAs can help with people’s social and emotional health. They can provide support in one-on-one or social settings, making a person feel more confident and helping them to better tolerate the situation.\nChoosing an emotional support animal\nWhile service animals tend to be dogs, any domesticated animal can be an ESA.\nESAs can be “dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, mice, ferrets,” Murphy says. In fact, there have been instances of people having peacocks, reptiles, and other exotic animals as ESAs. Generally, however, cats and dogs are the most popular choice.\nDogs are the most popular ESA due to their temperament, flexibility, and how possible it is to train them. However, all dogs are different, and some breeds are better suited to being ESAs than others. “Some popular ESA dog breeds are Golden Retrievers, Labradors, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Poodles, and Yorkshire Terriers,” Murphy says. One deciding factor is how easy it is to take smaller breeds to different places.\nChoosing the right companion to be your ESA isn’t that different from choosing a pet. You need a calm, loving animal with a good temperament who can learn how to support you in the ways you need. Some breeds learn things faster than others, but all animals can make good ESAs.\nHow to legally obtain an emotional support animal\nAny animal can be an Emotional Support Animal, but they do need to be prescribed by a mental health professional.\nVisit a therapist, a psychiatrist, or another person trained to recognize your need for an ESA. All you need is for them to sign a letter declaring your need for an ESA. You canalso registeryouranimal online.\nWhere can you bring your emotional support dog or animal?\nYou can bring your ESA anywhere you can bring a pet. You may be able to bring them to other other places based on their policies, including:\nUnfortunately, ESAs are not covered under the ACAA, so you cannot bring your ESA on a flight that you wouldn’t otherwise be able to bring a pet onto.\nAs your right to an ESA is not protected in the same way that service animals are, they have the same rights under the law as a pet. This means that while your college may allow an ESA with documentation, they don’t have to.\nSimilarly, while you may be able to bring your ESA into a workplace that would otherwise allow you to bring any other pet, there are no legal regulations that require your workplace to allow you to bring an ESA.\nLearn who can write one for you.\nChallenges and criticisms of ESAs\nSadly, there are still challenges to having an ESA.\nMany people have fraudulently called their pets ESAs just so that they can bring them everywhere, which has damaged the reputation of ESAs. “Some providers do not write ESA letters due to lack of clear guidelines and ethical concerns,” Murphy says.\n“Some people feel that people are misusing the system,” Murphy says. “Some people are trying to pass their animal off as a service animal to gain access to some public spaces or gain other benefits of being a service animal, and this can be dangerous. Additionally, Murphy says, “a number of people are also gaining their ESA letters through commercial sites that are fraudulent. This also underlines the ESA system and poses risk to the handler, animal, and landlord.”\nFAQs\nThere are a number of mental health struggles that may lead to a person getting an ESA letter, including bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and many more.\nESAs are not required to complete any training, so any animal can theoretically be an ESA. However, you may run into some difficulty with larger or more exotic animals. A landlord may not accept an ESA that is too large for the property.\nThere are many reasons why people are against ESAs, most of which stem from people not completely understanding what they are. Additionally, some people have made fraudulent claims just because they want to have their pet in their apartment, which makes others skeptical even when people have legitimate ESAs.\nReferences\nFerrell, J., & Crowley, S.

    "page_content": "Dog training is an ongoing process that requires patience, time, and ongoing commitment, whether you are training a new puppy or an older dog who has developed some less-than-ideal habits. Leash-training is an important part of this process, because you need to be able to take your dog on walks and out in public. Training collars can be a useful tool to support you during the training process, but it is important to note that there is no training collar that will solve all of your dog’s behavior challenges.\nThere are a lot of factors that go into choosing the right collar for your dog, depending on their size, temperament, and specific training needs. The ideal training collar is safe, effective, and comfortable for your pup.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nExperts pick the best harnesses for every kind of dog—from flat-faced breeds to tiny teacups to escape artists.\nTypes of training collars for dogs\nThere are a few different types of training collars for dogs. While each has the basic purpose of allowing you to safely maintain control of your dog, different variations offer different benefits that can support you on your training journey. To understand these different uses and benefits, we spoke with certified professional dog trainer and co-founder of Dogboy NYC,Robert Haussmann. “There’s no one-size-fits-all collar option for training a puppy or a dog,” Haussmann says. “There’s a lot of things that come into the picture and the puzzle.”\nA flat collar is a basic dog collar with a buckle. Flat collars work well for everyday wear and are often a great place to attach leash and identification tags with your dog’s name and your contact information. However, a flat collar might not be the best option for training a dog who pulls, lunges, or is otherwise excitable on a leash; the collar around their neck can put pressure on their trachea.\nSimilar to a traditional flat collar,martingale collarssecure around a dog’s neck. It has a larger loop that goes around the dog’s neck and a smaller loop that attaches to the lead and tightens when a dog pulls. When the tension releases, the smaller loop loosens, encouraging dog’s not to pull. Martingale collars can only tighten to a certain point, unlike a slip collar, and are designed to be a safe option that prevents choking.\nHead collars are collars that loop around a dog’s neck and their snout. When a dog pulls, the collar directs the dog’s attention back to the walker. Head collars are also called gentle leaders, also called “head haltis” or “gentle leaders.” Sometrainers are not fansof head collars, largely because they are formatted to fit like a horse halter.\n“Dogs’ necks are not built like a horse’s and can easily be damaged by an owner pulling too hard in one direction,” trainer Charlie DiBono told us. DiBono also noted that dogs have many nerves that run through their noses, so putting pressure on that part of their body could potentially create damage. “Through these nerves that lead from their nose to their eyes, dogs can literally see things that they smell,” DiBono says. We should not be placing any pressure in such a sensitive location and applying force to their heads causing trauma to their neck.”Again, the head halti is a popular tool with many trainers, so please consult with your positive reinforcement trainer about what they prefer (and consult with your vet as well if you have safety concerns).\nSometimes, the question is not “What type of collar is best for my dog?” but rather “Is a collar the best option for my dog?” For some dogs,harnesses may be a more effectiveand comfortable tool. There are different types of harness, but most attach around a dog’s head and torso, reducing some of the pressure that a collar can put on their neck. For dog’s who pull, a no-pull, front-clip harness allows walkers to use leverage to interrupt the dog’s ability to pull forward.\n“I like harnesses a lot, whether it’s no-pull or not, just because it keeps the pressure off of a very gentle structure, their trachea, and doesn’t put a lot of wear and tear on their spine and neck,” Haussmann says. He emphasizes that if you choose to use a harness, you should still keep a collar on your dog with identification tags (and always make sure theirmicrochip informationis up to date, too).\nAn online search for “training collars” will likely turn up a lot of mentions of e-collars, or collars that make sounds, vibrations, or shocks. Kinship strongly advises that pet parents use only humane collar options and never use those that are fear- or pain-based, like shock collars. An e-collar that makes a sound or vibration may be appropriate in specific scenarios, for example, on hunting dogs who work off leash and require a cue to return to their parents or a deaf dog who needs to feel the vibration to look at their parent for training cues. Kinship, nor any of the trainers we consult, never recommends using the shock function on a collar.\nStyle and safety don’t have to be mutually exclusive (phew).\nBest collars for dog training and specific needs\nThe best collar for your dog will depend on your training goals or dog’s behavioral challenges.  “There’s not one ‘best collar’ necessarily,” Haussmann says. “I think a lot of it has to do with the dog that you have and how early you start.”\nPuppies are little balls of energy, and they usually aren’t the best listeners when they’re young. That combination typically results in them not walking well on a leash — at least in the beginning. When choosing a collar, it’s important to find the right balance of one that won’t slip off their head and won’t choke them when they take off running. Because of this combination, Haussmann usually recommends a harness for puppies who are going to be on a leash. He advises using a collar in addition for identification.\nWhentraining puppies, getting them comfortable with collars, leashes, and harnesses early and using positive reinforcement can prevent discomfort and bad habits later.\n“You want to make sure your dog is comfortable wearing a collar [or] harness. You gotta get them used to that, and not just wearing it, but having it put on and off,” Haussmann says. “A lot of times, dogs can get squirrely or uncomfortable with that kind of handling. … Pairing the experience with something pleasant and teaching the dog how you’re going to be manipulating its body can make it so that they’re not trying to escape every time you pull the collar or harness out.”\nMany dogs get in the habit ofpulling on a leash, which can be unpleasant for the person trying to walk them and potentially dangerous for the dog if they are pulling hard enough to put a lot of pressure on their necks. Certain collars can reduce pulling and protect your dog’s neck.\nFor moderate pullers, Haussmann recommends a martingale collar, since the tightening pressure can train dogs not to pull. On extreme pullers, however, a martingale might put too much pressure on the neck. For these dogs, Haussmann recommends a no-pull harness or head collar, since both can be effective options for redirecting a dog’s ability to pull forward.\nRather than pulling, some dogs tend to drag behind when on a leash. This may be a result of their opposition reflex–a natural instinct where dogs pull or lean in the opposite direction that the leash holder wants them to go. For these dragging pups, a harness that clips on their back may be effective, because it will interrupt a dog’s inclination to move backwards without straining their neck.\nCollars can be challenging for certain breeds with small, narrow heads, such as greyhounds, whippets, and sighthounds. With heads that are the same size or smaller than their necks, these breeds can easily slip out of traditional collars. Martingale collars can be effective, since they would tighten rather than slipping over the dog’s head. Harnesses would also be effective, since they usually connect underneath a dog’s armpits.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nAre shock collars bad for dogs?\nShock collars can have negative effects on dogs and not a form of positive reinforcement training.  Kinship only recommends positive reinforcement training tactics for dogs and never recommends punishment-based collars, including shock and prong collars. Haussman advises against them, saying that in most cases, behavioral issues that someone may try to solve with a shock collar can be resolved more humanely with training and positive reinforcement. This 2020study foundpositive reinforcement to be more effective than an e-collar.\nHow to leash-train a dog who pulls\nPulling is a relatively common dog habit that can be difficult to break once it has started, since dogs can become conditioned to need to feel pressure in order to move forward.Leash-trainingusing positive reinforcement can be an effective tool to prevent and correct the behavior. Haussmann recommends starting in an area with no distractions, like your living room or apartment hallway, and gradually work up to more challenging environments, like a dog park or busy sidewalk.\n“You would want to make sure you are adding value to walking beside you by using treats, praise, maybe toys, whatever works for your dog,” Haussmann says. “Food is usually the low hanging fruit … It’s a great place to start training and show your dog that walking by your side with no pressure on a leash has intrinsic value.”\nOver time, as your dog develops positive habits on a leash, you shouldn’t need to depend on food as a reward as often. It may be more difficult to correct pulling in adopted dogs who have already made a habit of it, but with consistent training and the right tools, like a no-pull harness or head collar, you can be successful.\nFAQs\nThe best harness for training depends on your dog, their habits, and your lifestyle. When choosing a harness, you should make sure that it is safe and comfortable for your dog. Check out ourexpert picksfor the best harness for every dog, from heavy pullers to swimmers.\nDog sizing can be tricky, especially when breeds vary so drastically in size. The basic rule of thumb for a well-fitting collar is being able to comfortably place two fingers underneath.

    "page_content": "Does yourdog get distressedwhen you leave them alone? Do they cry or shake or act out in destructive orself-harming ways? Do they start engaging in these behaviors before you even approach the door? Like when you are brushing your teeth, putting on your shoes, turning off the TV, or rummaging in your bag?\nDogs are extremely observant creatures and their favorite thing to observe is you. Makes sense given that you control every aspect of their lives — from when they eat to when they go outside and for how long. In the course of their observations, they may come to notice that you engage in certain behaviors before you leave the house. These behaviors become what are known as pre-departure cues, or PDQs. And if your dog experiences separation anxiety or distress, they may act out whenever you engage in these behaviors, whether you actually separate from them or not.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nAlmost anything can be a PDQ if it is repeatedly performed leading up to your departure. “Routine gestures, like organizing items or gathering things to take with you, can hint to a dog that you’re preparing to leave,” says Qiai Chong, chief behaviorist atPet Coach SG. “Dogs notice PDQs because they are fully present in the moment. And this heightened awareness allows them to pick up on specific activities — including those we may perform subconsciously — and associate them with our departure.”\nPDQs only become a problem when they cause stress behavior — salivating, panting, pacing, crying, barking, shivering, etc. These behaviors might seem minor when you first observe them, but think of your dog like a wind-up toy, and the longer they engage in these stress behaviors before you leave, the more wound up they get. Then, when you’re finally gone, their wind-up key is released and they explode that anxiety all over your house by barking non-stop or tearing up the sofa.\nIf your dog has one PDQ, they’ll get wound up a little, but since you likely engage in multiple pre-departure behaviors your dog may have five or even 10. Each PDQ adds to their anxiety and makes the actual act of you leaving all the more distressing. ”Some dogs may go to great lengths to escape these feelings,” Chong says. “Sometimes, resulting in self-harming behaviors, like chewing on doors or even attempting to jump through windows.”\nHow to get PDQs under control\nFirst, you need to figure out exactly what your dog’s PDQs are. Jessica Jacobson, a dog behavior expert and certified dog trainer atDapper Dog Trainingin New York City, suggests making a list of all the things you do before leaving the house. Then you want to go through this list and see which ones actually elicit a response in your dog. “Be sure to test them separately, not in sequence,” Jacobson says. “Otherwise, you won’t know which individual actions actually trigger your dog.”\nKeep in mind that tasks may need to be broken down into smaller component parts in order for you to figure out exactly where and when your dog is being triggered and help them through it. For instance, putting on your shoes might seem like a simple task, but it actually involves a number of smaller steps: sitting down, reaching for your shoes, actually touching your shoes, putting your feet inside your shoes, lacing your shoes up, etc. And any one of these steps could be the one that triggers your dog. In order to know for sure, you need to watch your dog at every step of this process. When you notice them reacting to what you’re doing, stop. Give them time to recover, then reset and repeat the action up to that specific point until they no longer react.\n“To be effective, this action needs to be repeated multiple times during the day,” Jacobson adds. “If done correctly, your dog should become desensitized to this portion of the action within a couple of days, then you can continue to move forward with the action until you get to another point of reactivity.”\n“Repeating these actions without leaving will gradually help your dog disconnect these cues from your departure,” says Divij Gupta, a canine behaviorist and trainer atSploot. “Over time, they will feel less anxious when you truly need to go, as these cues will no longer trigger immediate stress.”\nOnce you manage to fully desensitize one action on your list, you can move on to another and another, until you’ve worked your way through all your dog’s PDQs. You will need to revisit each trigger from time to time, though, incorporating it into your daily routine with your dog at random intervals to make sure they do not become resensitized.\nAddressing your dog’s separation anxiety\nThe reason PDQs have power over your dog in the first place is because your dog has negative feelings about being left alone. So if you really want to help your dog, you have to address these feelings head on.\nFortunately, you can train your dog to be alone the same way you desensitize them to their PDQs. Chong suggests walking toward the door, then returning to your dog. If your dog doesn’t react, try putting your hand on the doorknob, turning the doorknob, opening the door, etc. At any point, if your dog begins to react, stop, allow your dog to calm down, then reset and try again. Eventually, you should get to the point where you can step outside, then close the door behind you. Stay on the other side for 10 seconds, then 20, then 30. You want to make sure that you return before your dog starts reacting. If you are gone for too long and your dog gets upset, you may have to go back a step or two to regain your progress.\nUnderstand that you may only get five minutes of focus out of them before the process itself becomes stressful. This is not a process you can rush. So, instead of dedicating half an hour to this training once a day, do three to five minutes of training three or four times a day.\n“Once your dog can comfortably manage alone time for approximately 30 minutes, you can begin to re-introduce one PDQ at a time,” Chong says. “It’s normal for there to be some regression in duration during this phase, as the intensity of the perceived separation increases. The key is to introduce each PDQ slowly, allowing your dog to adjust, and then gradually build back their alone time.”\nWhatnotto do\nDealing with PDQs and separation issues can be extremely frustrating, but do your best to remain calm, even if your dog does something upsetting like chewing on your shoes or ripping a hole in the couch. “Punishment can intensify the aversive emotions your dog is already experiencing,” Chong says. “Instead of helping, it can lead to increased anxiety and fear, making the situation worse.”\nDon’t just put them in a crate, either. “While crate training can help dogs feel secure in a confined space, the goal here is to help your dog feel comfortable being left alone, not just in a crate,” Chong says. “These are two different processes and trying to accomplish too much at once can set your dog up for failure and increase their anxiety.”\n“Don’t make a big fuss when leaving or returning home,” Gupta adds. “That could also end up heightening your dog’s anxiety.” Remember that the goal of this training is to calm your dog when you are preparing to leave them. This may require that you allow yourself more time in the morning so you can slow down a little and leave peacefully instead of rushing around in a last-minute tornado of your own anxiety, which will only rile your dog up, too.\nJacobson also suggests that you not take your dog for a walk or cuddle them right before you leave. That might seem counterintuitive, but walks and affection can be very stimulating for a dog and if you leave them alone right after you’ve gotten them excited, you could be supercharging their anxiety. Better to wait a bit until they have calmed down before you head out.\n“Don’t give them food before leaving either,” Chong says. “While some people may think counterconditioning through treats can help,research showsthat this approach is not actually effective for separation-related behaviors. In fact, giving your dog food right before you leave can heighten their anticipation of your departure, potentially increasing their anxiety when you go.”\nWhen should you seek professional help?\n“Separation anxiety and PDQs are really complicated issues,” Jacobson says. ”And dealing with them can leave people feeling trapped in their own homes.” If that’s how you’re feeling, seek help immediately. You don’t have to do this alone, and as helpful as the tips above may be, each dog is different and dog trainers and behaviorists are able to observe your dogs in a way you can’t. They can also offer suggestions tailored to your dog that you might never even have thought of.\n“Sometimes, what looks like separation anxiety to a dog parent is actually something completely different,” says Jacobson, who often finds that adjustments to a dog’s environment are enough to alleviate behaviors otherwise attributed to separation. So, don’t assume you can diagnose the problem. And don’t feel bad if you can’t seem to help your dog on your own. Training can be a financial hardship, but it is an investment in your dog’s wellbeing and your relationship that will pay big dividends.",

    },
    "page_content": "Proper training is as important for your dog’s wellbeing as food, rest, and exercise. Training helps them understand the world around them and their place in it and opens up essential lines of communication between you. It’s also a much-needed form of mental stimulation and, when done properly and positively, can be as fun for your dog asplay time.\nIdeally,training should begin early, when your dog is still a puppy, and be reinforced through daily repetition, but it is never too late to train your dog. The old saying that “you can’t teach an old dog new tricks,” is just flat-out wrong. With compassion and dedication and the right treats, you can teach an old dog just about anything. And if there’s one command dogs of all ages need to know, it’s “drop it.”\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nWhy you should teach your dog to “drop it”\n“In my opinion, ‘drop it’ is one of those lifesaving commands every dog should know,” says Annie-Mae Levy, a professional dog trainer atWoofz. “It’s important because it helps you take control in situations where your dog picks up something dangerous like a piece of food they shouldn’t eat, a toxic plant, or even something sharp.”\n“Drop it” is also handy during playtime. As anyone who has ever tried toplay fetchcan attest, fetch with a dog who doesn’t know how to drop what is in their mouth can turn from fun to frustrating pretty quick.\nThe questions to ask and credentials to look out for to find the right trainer foryourdog, according to a pro.\nWhat you will need\nWhen teaching your dog to “drop it,” Levy suggests having some treats, a toy they enjoy playing with, and a clicker if you use clicker training. “The treats act as a reward for giving up the item, and the toy makes it fun for them to engage with you,” Levy says. “The key is making the trade worth it for the dog, so you need to have something better than what they’re holding.”\nIf you’re struggling to find a properly motivating treat, try theviral muffin-tin trickto figure out which treats are of the highest value to your dog. The results might surprise you.\nSteps to teach your dog to “drop it”\nWhen training a new skill, it is best to limit any additional stimuli that might make it difficult for your dog to focus. So, if your yard is full of squirrels your dog likes to chase, train new skills inside. If the living room is too rowdy, move your training session into the bedroom and close the door. The easier you can make it for your dog to focus, the faster they will learn and the easier it will be for you to retrain the skill in new and more hectic environments.\nMake sure you have everything (treats, toy, and clicker) set up and ready to go before you bring your dog into the training space. Doing so should help you feel more calm and focused, which, in turn, should help your dog feel more calm and focused.\n“Use a toy your dog likes but isn’t obsessed with,” Levy adds. You want it to be something appealing, but notas appealingas the treat you’re going to give them when they drop it.\nLet them hold the toy for a few seconds, then offer them a treat while saying “drop it.”\nWhen they release the toy,give them the treatand whatever verbal or physical praise to which they respond best.\nMake a fist, and point it toward your dog, then, while saying “drop it,” open your hand as if dropping something. When your dog obeys, reward them like before. Over time, you can even phase out the words “drop it” all together.\nStop them before a stare turns into a fight.\nNow your dog will have a verbal and non-verbal cue for the same command, which will help reinforce the command in their mind and give you options when you’re out in the world.\nOnce they are obeying properly, begin phasing out the treats, but keep giving them verbal or physical praise like before. Over time, they will associate obedience with feeling good and should need little to no additional reward for following your commands.\nThe keys to training any dog are regularity and repetition. Ideally, you should practice your dog’s obedience skills every day, and not just at home. Commands like “drop it” are often most useful outside the home anyway — when you’re on a walk or at the park — so it is essential that you retrain these skills in all the different environments where your dog spends time. Just because they can “drop it” at home, when no one is around, doesn’t mean they can do the same thing at a busy park or in the vet’s office. That’s not how a dog’s brain works. Keep treats on you at all times and try to view every new space you enter with your dog as an opportunity to reinforce their training.\nWhen to get help from a trainer\nTraining a dog can be tough, so if you are struggling, seek professional help. “I’d suggest seeking help from a trainer if your dog consistently refuses to drop items, shows signs ofresource guarding, or if you’re feeling frustrated with the training process,” Levy says. “A professional can assesswhyyour dog isn’t responding and give you tailored advice.”\nProfessional help is also essential if your dog is acting aggressive towards you during the training process. Do your best not to respond to their aggression with anger or violence and instead seek professional help sooner rather than later. “It’s better to address those kinds of issues early before they become more serious,” Levy warns.\nIt’s also important to communicate your dog’straining needs to the people around you— friends, family, dog walkers, etc. — so they can help, rather than hinder, you in your efforts. Dog training is important and it’s hard work and the people in your and your dog’s life should support what you’re doing, even if it means they can’t necessarily interact with your dog in the way they want to.\nAnd they’ll thank you for it.\nFAQs:\nIf your dog grabs something dangerous, like chocolate or a sharp object, and won’t drop it, first and foremost, you must remain calm. “Avoid turning it into a chase or tug-of-war,” Levy says. “In my experience, sometimes offering a higher-value treat or toy can entice them to release it. If that doesn’t work, gently restraining them and carefully removing the object might be necessary, but it’s best to try to avoid panicking and escalating the situation.”\n“Honestly, it always depends on the dog,” Levy says. “But with consistent practice, most dogs can get the hang of it within a couple of weeks.”\nThat said, it could take longer to fully master this skill if your dog is more stubborn or attached to certain toys or other items in your home. “The key is patience and making the training sessions short and fun so they stay engaged,” Levy says.\n“Try switching up your approach,” Levy says. “Maybe the treats you’re using aren’t enticing enough, or the item they’re holding is too high-value. You could also practice more in low-distraction environments until they get more consistent.”\nDon’t make it a battle of wills: Just calmly reset and try again later with something easier for them to let go of.\n“Making training fun is all about keeping it light and rewarding,” Levy says. “Use toys your dog loves and plenty of treats, and don’t be afraid to add in play breaks during the session. Dogs love games, so if you can turn “drop it” into part of a fetch or tug game, it keeps them engaged.”\nAnd remember that dogs pick up on your energy: so praise and excitement can go a long way too.\n“If your dog gets aggressive, it’s important to back off and assess the situation,” Levy says. “Resource guarding is a common issue, and pushing the dog too hard in those moments can make things worse.”\nInstead of forcing the issue, try working on trading up and offering them something even better than what they’re holding. If your dog shows consistent aggression, it’s a good idea to consult with a trainer who specializes in behavior issues. “Aggression can be tricky to handle on your own and you might face repercussions for uncareful actions,” Levy warns.\nWhatever you do, don’t give up. The harder your dog is to train, the more important training is. Remember that dog’s don’t misbehave out of spite. They are confused and scared and desperate to communicate and it is up to you to put in the work required to help them.",

    },
    "page_content": "Training a puppy to pee outside requires consistency, patience, and positive reinforcement to establish good habits early on. You can effectively train your pup by creating a regular schedule, closely monitoring their behavior, and rewarding successful outdoor bathroom trips.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHow to train your puppy to pee outside\nWhen training a puppy, it’s helpful touse positive reinforcement. Positive reinforcement allows you to reward your dog for doing the correct behavior over and over. When using positive reinforcement, you are rewarding your dog before they have the chance to do something wrong. This helps you establish a great routine with your dog. The more they do the correct thing and are rewarded, the more this behavior will become a habit and will help avoid behaviors you do not want.\nReward your pup as soon as they pee or poop. You will want to use a yummy treat. If your puppy is prone to accidents, it may be a good idea to get a high-value treat to use only during potty training. Puppies are easily distracted, so remember to wait until they are done going to crinkle the treat bag to reward them.\nAn accident is just that, an accident your puppy is learning all about the world and is learning what is right and wrong. When you scold your dog for having an accident, you are only teaching them not use the bathroom in front of you. Since a puppy doesn't understand human language if you yell or get upset with your puppy they don’t understand ‘no don't pee here’. They are only learning that you got mad that they peed not that you are mad about where they had the accident. This may cause your puppy to continue to have accidents and instead begin to hide them from you.\nEstablishing a routine is the best way to avoid accidents. When potty training you should always take your puppy outside right away after eating, playing, or waking from a nap. If you live in an apartment or have a long walk to get outside, it may be best to pick up your pup on the way out. This will help prevent an accident if your puppy can’t hold it en route.  A timer is your best friend when potty training. As soon as your puppy goes, restart your timer again.\nTeaching your puppy to ring a bell when they need to pee or poop is a great way to help dogs communicate the need to go outside. Choosing the correct bell that a dog can ring is important. Your dog will either nudge the bell with their nose or swat the bell with their paw. So, keep that in mind when choosing the bell to buy and where to keep it in the house.\nAt first, you will need to teach your puppy to ring the bell separately from using the bathroom. When introducing the bell to your dog, start by ringing the bell right before you open the door to take your puppy out. As you ring the bell each time you take your puppy to the bathroom, you are creating an association with that sound and the door opening for potty time.\nRemember, potty time is not play time, so if your puppy is trying to play, ignore them by standing in one spot, holding the leash. When you beginning training, it’s best to always go to the same spot to let your puppy use the bathroom. This will help you train your dog to go to the bathroom right when they come outside, rather than sniffing and sniffing, looking for the perfect spot to go.\nNow that your puppy is empty, has played a little, and is ready to learn, it’s time to train your puppy to ring the bell.\nStart by allowing them to examine the bell. New things can be scary to a puppy, so let them sniff and engage with it (don’t let them play tug with it). Once you have your puppy engaging with the bell, you can reward them with a treat each time they touch the bell (if you have a more timid dog you may need to start by just rewarding them when they look over at the bell, then move to touch). Once your puppy is willingly touching the bell, you will then stop rewarding for just touching and reward it when they nudge it harder so it makes a sound.\nContinue to reward them for making the bell sound until they are able to do it consistently and that it is loud enough to hear in another room. When your pup is comfortable with ringing the bell you can add it into your potty routine. Remember, if you think your puppy may have an accident, you should continue to ring the bell yourself. Otherwise, you can let your pup ring the bell and immediately take them outside.\nAs you begin to consistently do this, your dog will build an association with ringing the bell and going outside. Over time, your puppy will ring the bell to go outside without your help when this happens, you must take your puppy outside right away, and remember to keep them on the leash. Puppies are very smart, so you want to make sure you are training your puppy to ring the bell only to go to the bathroom not to go outside and play.\nFirst step: patience.\nHow to potty train puppy from a pee pad to outside\nYay —  it’s finally time to move your puppyaway from the pee padand get them to go outside, but how do you do this? Some puppies may be easy. You may be able to take them right outside after they eat, play, or wake from a nap. If you do this, they will go because you have created a routine with these behaviors. But some puppies may have a harder time; there can be a lot of new distractions outside.\nIf they have trouble, you can take a used pee pad outside to start. Place it on the floor by a tree or in an area you think looks inviting for a puppy to go to the bathroom place it there and wait (with your puppy on the leash). Allow your puppy to sniff the area and when they use the bathroom reward them. Remember to be consistent, and use the same area to go to the bathroom throughout the duration of training your puppy.\nContinue to do this a few times. Then, you can use a clean pee pad. Once your puppy is going consistently with the non-soiled pad, try and have them go with no pee pad at all. Remember to give your puppy a few minutes to figure it out before giving up. Puppies take time to generalize skills. Each time you add a new piece to the puzzle (or take it away in this case) it is like a new skill to your puppy.\nIf anything requires patience, it’s this.\nPuppy potty training schedule\nHere is a sample schedule to follow as you begin your potty training journey with your puppy. These are just general guidelines; always adjust your puppy’s schedule to meet their needs. Also, the size of your puppy may affect how often they need to go out. The amount of food or water your puppy has consumed may affect the frequency needed for bathroom breaks. Has your puppy just: woken up, played, eaten? Go right outside.\nFollow this if your puppy is out and about during free time, after they have played, eaten, or slept.\nNew to potty training or two to three months old: Take them out 30 minutes; maximum hold time: one hour\nNew to potty training or two to three months old: Take them out 30 minutes; maximum hold time: one hour\nThree to four months old: Take them out 45 minutes to one hour; maximum hold time: two hours\nThree to four months old: Take them out 45 minutes to one hour; maximum hold time: two hours\nFour to five months: Take them out every two hours; maximum hold time: three to four hours\nFour to five months: Take them out every two hours; maximum hold time: three to four hours\nFive to six months: Take them out every three hours; maximum hold time: five to six hours\nFive to six months: Take them out every three hours; maximum hold time: five to six hours\nFollow these guidelines when your puppy is home alone and crated.

Are you sticking to it consistently? If you aren’t, then you may need to shorten the time between potty breaks. Are there any new or added stressors or anxiety for your puppy? This can be a cause of accidents.\nAs always, be sure that the entire family is on board with the potty training rules and schedules, it must be followed by everyone who is home with the puppy. Always go to the same area that way your dog can smell their urine from last time, and it will remind them of what they need to do outside. Have a treat party after they go: Give them a few treats, and use a lot of praise and petting.\nTypically, if you are taking your puppy outside only for them to come back inside and pee, they are not properly potty trained yet. Always go to the same place when taking your puppy outside do not take them on a walk to use the bathroom just stand in one area and allow them to sniff in a circle around you. This will create consistency. Once your puppy goes to the bathroom reward them with a few treats and a lot of praise.\nCould something outside be scaring your puppy or giving them anxiety? This may prevent them from using the bathroom in a certain area. Keep an eye on their behavior when they are outside. Do they look stiff, crouch down, have their ears perked up, or are they quickly looking from spot to spot? There may be something outside that is causing them to be afraid, which may prevent them from going.\nPotty training regression can happen. Change in your puppy’s environment or routine can be a cause for a potty training regression. If your puppy starts a new food or something upsets their stomach they may have unusual accidents. Sometimes, construction outside or extra noise can lead to anxiety, which can also cause regression.\nGo back a few steps in your training to help your puppy be successful. Shorten the time between potty breaks and go back to rewarding your puppy if you have stopped.\nAccidents are going to happen during potty training, it is not a perfect science, even with all of the consistency and treats. When an accident happens, stay calm. If you just found the accident on the floor do not bring it to your dog’s attention, just quietly clean it up.\nYou can not scold a dog for something they did in the past. If you catch your puppy mid-accident, calmly say, “Oops,” and redirect them to outside as fast as you can. When they finish going potty in the correct area, be sure to heavily reward them. Only give your puppy free time in the house when you know they are “empty.” This will help prevent accidents and give you more control when it comes to successful pee breaks outside.\nWhen cleaning up an accident, use an enzymatic cleaning product and try your best to get everything. Do not use a cleaner that is ammonia-based; urine has ammonia in it. If you are use a cleaner with ammonia the area will still smell like urine and your dog may continue to pee in that area.\nTraining your puppy to pee outside when it’s cold or snowing is the same as training them to go outside when it is not. Depending on your dog’s breed and temperament, they may adjust to the colder weather easier than others. If your dog is affected by the cold,try a jacket. If you have a very small short-hair breed, and it’s extremely cold, you may need to enlist the help of pee pads until it gets a bit warmer. Your vet will be able to help you decide if it would be best to keep your small puppy inside for a bit during the colder months.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nAll puppies are different, and it’s hard to give an exact timeline of when a specific puppy will be potty trained. Your consistency also plays a huge factor in how fast it takes for your puppy to get potty trained. With consistent training, it can take between four to six months for your puppy to be potty trained, but some puppies may take a year.\nPlace your puppy on a pee pad after they have eaten, played, or just woke up, this will make it easy for you to catch your puppy in the act. Reward them for using the bathroom on the pee pad. After your puppy has used the bathroom start your timer, when it goes off place your puppy on the mat. It may be helpful to use a leash to assist with keeping them on the mat while you wait for them to go.\nPuppies can generallyhold their peefor the number of months they are old plus one. So, a four month old puppy can typically hold his pee for about five hours. This timeline does not include when your puppy has just woken up, played or eaten. You should always take a puppy right out to the bathroom after those three activities.\nYes, it’s important to learn your puppies “tells” when potty training. Look out for what your puppy does right before peeing. This will help you learn when they are just about ready to go so you can better have a handle on when they need to go out. They may walk around in a circle, start barking, become restless, or start sniffing around.",

One-thousand percent correct.\nChoosing the right trainer to give the honor of working with you and your dog can seem like an overwhelming, daunting leap of faith. Don’t worry. We got you. Here’s our insider/trainer’s eye view to help take the mystery out of your search and make sure you and your dog have a safe, positive experience.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThis first part isunfortunate but true: There are zero regulations in the dog-training industry. That means anyone and their neighbor can say they’re a dog trainer with no professional experience or education and charge money to train dogs. This not only leads to serious harm to dogs with dangerous and outdated methods, but wasting your valuable time and money with ineffective training. All the more reason to ask all the right questions and know the red flags to look out for.\nWhat’s the trainer’s M.O.?\nThe most important thing to find out about a trainer ishowthey will train your dog. Science and experience over the years have made it clear that “positive reinforcement” or “reward-based” training is the most effective and humane way to train dogs. Positive methods focus on the use of rewards, usually food, to make the behavior you want to happen happen and the withholding of rewards to make unwanted behaviors less likely. Your dog will be the happiest student ever.\nYour puppy training schedule, from eight weeks to six months. Let’s do this.\nPositive trainers avoid the use of any negative techniques and tools, such as electronic collars (shock collars), prong collars, choke collars, leash corrections, and other forms of punishment. These methods often only suppress undesirable behaviors and have been proven to cause additional behavior problems, like fearfulness, aggression, and learned helplessness. These are all problems that usually take longer to fix than the initial training issue.\nSome trainers use a mix of rewards and punishment — a key watch-out is for the term “balanced trainer.” Balance is great in every other part of your life except training, where it’s a euphemism for the ambiguity of rewardingandpunishing your dog for behaviors.\nWhat credentials should a trainer have?\nIn an unregulated industry, there are many paths to a quality education as a professional trainer, but  “loves dogs,” “have had dogs all my life,” or “have worked with dogs for 10 years” don’t qualify. While experience is important, dog training and behavior modification is a science. Understanding how dogs learn, how to effect and change behavior humanely, and how to read dog body language are skills that require study. Some respected dog training certifications to look for in your trainer search (list is not exhaustive):\nKPA-CTP\nKPA-CTP\nCTC\nCTC\nCPDT-KA\nCPDT-KA\nCBCC-KA\nCBCC-KA\nCDBC\nCDBC\nVSA-CDT\nVSA-CDT\nEach of these organizations has a search to find one of their certified trainers by location. But certifications aren’t a full-proof guarantee. Just because a trainer has letters after their name, doesn’t mean they uphold the standards of the certifying organization or they will be a good match for you. Do your research, ask questions, and make sure you know what’s going to happen during your training sessions.\nA dog behaviorist schools us on why puppy classes are more about socializing than getting straight As.\nAnd just because a dog trainer has a laundry list of education, doesn’t mean they have experience or are a good teacher. Dog training is often 75 percent training people and 25 percent training dogs, so your person should be able to speak to you just as well as they can speak to your dog.\nQuestions to ask before hiring a trainer:\nWhat method of training do you use?\nWhat method of training do you use?\nWhat is your education? Do you have any certifications/belong to any professional organizations?\nWhat is your education? Do you have any certifications/belong to any professional organizations?\nWhat equipment will you use on/with my dog?\nWhat equipment will you use on/with my dog?\nWhat happens if my dog makes a mistake / gets it wrong?\nWhat happens if my dog makes a mistake / gets it wrong?\nCan you provide references?\nCan you provide references?\nIf any of the answers to these questions leave you feeling uneasy, uncomfortable, or the dog trainer asks you to do things to/with your dog you feel are wrong, don’t hire them. It’s that easy. Just because they’re the “professional” doesn’t mean they’re right for your dog. And take a look around a potential trainer’s social media — sometimes you’ll get a more revealing sense of their vibe, good or bad, than you might from a direct answer.\nRed flags and clues you can use\nNo one is going to say their methods are outdated, dangerous, and unsupported by science, but if you know how to spot the red flags and what’s behind them, you’ll have all the clues you need to know when to steer clear. Here are some widely agreed-upon red flags to identify trainers using old school and harmful methods:\nThey use language like “alpha/dominance/pack leader.” These theories and methods have been long debunked in the current dog training world and don’t meet the standards of science-based training.\nThey use language like “alpha/dominance/pack leader.” These theories and methods have been long debunked in the current dog training world and don’t meet the standards of science-based training.\nThey won’t or don’t use food.\nThey won’t or don’t use food.\nThey focus on punishing behaviors rather than rewarding behaviors.\nThey focus on punishing behaviors rather than rewarding behaviors.\nThey offer guarantees or quick behavior changes.

      "title": "Does Your Dog Fixate on Other Dogs? Here’s How to Get Them to Walk Away",
      "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/dog-fixating-on-another-dog"
    },
    "page_content": "Every dog owner has experienced this: you’re walking your dog and as you approach another person walking their dog, your pup stops. Their body goes rigid and they stare at the other dog with an intensity that only a dog can muster. It's as if everything around them has melted away and all that exists in the universe is the two of them. Sometimes a word from you is all it takes to break their focus and move them along, but other times, especially when the other dog is staring back, getting your pup to disengage can be a real challenge. And failing to do so can have disastrous consequences.\n“Intense eye contact for dogs is very confrontational and can lead to aggression,” says Annie-Mae Levy, adog trainer at Woofzwith a BS in animal behavior. “That’s why it is so important to have a plan in place, because once your dog fixates, things can escalate quickly — from barking, to lunging, to a full-blown fight.”\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nWhy do dogs fixate on each other?\nDogs fixate on each other for a number of reasons, many of them completely benign. They might want to play or find themselves with a lot of pent-up energy they don’t know what to do with. They could be curious about this other dog, or anticipating a greeting or some other form of interaction.\nYounger dogs might not yet know how to read the body language of other dogs, so they might fixate while trying to figure a new dog out.\n“The breed also plays a role,” says Levy. “Herding or hunting dogs, for example, may ‘lock on’ to things more easily.”\nTwo animal behavior experts agree it’s usuallyplay fighting. Here’s how you can tell.\n“Dogs also fixate when they are getting ready to defend themselves,” says Sally Grotini, a certified trainer of service and therapy dogs and dog behavior expert atJustAnswer. “They may also have a possessive aggressive temperament or be possessive of their human.” It’s also possible they have a naturally fearful temperament, which causes them to fixate more easily. These fear-based fixations are the ones most likely to lead to a fight, because even if your dog isn’t particularly aggressive or possessive, the dog they are fixating on might be. And it only takes one dog to start a fight.\nWhat should you do if you notice your dog fixating?\nFirst and foremost, don’t yank the leash. “Yanking the leash can actually cause the dog to act out faster,” says Grottini. “If a dog is fixed on a fight, yanking on the dog can put them in motion to do so.”\nLevy agrees. “Yanking on the leash might seem like a quick fix, but it can actually make things worse. It can even lead to the dog associating the discomfort they feel at being yanked with the other dog, which could make them even more reactive next time.”\nYanking on your dog’s leash can also hurt your dog’s neck, and saving your dog from getting hurt is the whole point of breaking their fixation in the first place.\nInstead, try blocking your dog’s view of the other dog. This can be as simple as slowly walking in front of your dog and then leading them away, as shown inthis Instagram reel from South End Dog Training. If that doesn’t work, try getting down on the dog’s level and fully blocking their view of the other dog. This should be enough to distract them to the point where you can redirect them away from the object of their fixation. If all else fails, you can use gentle pressure to move them along, but, again, don’t yank them. Use your hands to gently direct them where you want to go.\nGrottini also recommends keeping a favorite toy or high-value treat like chicken slivers in your pocket that you can pull out if your dog doesn’t want to give you their attention.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nAlternately, you may just need to walk your dog in a less crowded area, where there are fewer dogs for them to fixate on.\nCan you train your dog not to fixate in the first place?\nWhile you can’t train fixation behavior out of your dog entirely, you can train them to drop their fixation and return their attention to you.\nLevy recommends starting with a “look at me” command. Teach your dog the command at home, away from other dogs. Once the command is perfected, take them to a location where other dogs are present, but far away, and train the command again. Over time, you can move closer to the other dogs. Reinforce their behavior by rewarding them every time they glance at another dog and then return their attention to you. “It’s like building a habit,” says Levy. “They need to learn that it is rewarding to glance at things and then back at you.”\nGrottini recommends a similar command: “leave it,” which, when properly trained, can be used to get a dog to drop any fixation, whether it is another dog, a person, a car, or a piece of food on the sidewalk. “Many people do not train this command long enough as it should be trained for at least six months and trained with all sorts of items, people, other dogs, cars, etc. Anything you think the dog will encounter; this command should be taught around,” says Grottini.\nWhat if you notice another dog fixating on your dog?\nThere is no predicting or controlling what another person’s dog will do. Try to stop your own dog from staring back — using treats, a clicker, or well-trained commands like the ones discussed above — and then put some distance between both dogs.\n“It’s also important to stay calm and not overreact,” says Levy. “Because your dog is going to take cues from your behavior.”\nAt what point should you seek help from a trainer?\nTraining dogs is hard. Especially when you are trying to train them out of a reactive behavior like fixation. For this reason, both Grottini and Levy recommend seeking professional help sooner, rather than later. “If your dog’s fixations are constant and it’s leading to reactive or aggressive behavior, it’s time to get help from a professional trainer,” says Levy. “They can figure out if your dog is acting out of fear or excitement, or something else, and give you a solid idea on how to manage it.” They can help you practice commands and make sure you have all the tools you need to keep your dog and yourself safe.",

    },
    "page_content": "For even the most health-conscious human willing to bypass an elevator to get their steps in, stairs are an annoying but innocuous fact of life. But for some dogs, a flight of stairs might as well be Mount Everest. They come, they stare, and they do not conquer. This can become very frustrating for those of us who live, say, on the fourth floor of an apartment building that doesn’t even offer theoptionof an elevator. What’s a pet parent to do when that Great Dane puppy grows into a 150-pound statue who refuses to leave the ground floor?\nWhether you’retraining a new puppyor helping a reluctant adult dog overcome their fear, the right techniques will have your dog scaling those steps in no time. As with most training, the key is to be patient, methodical, and keepplenty of treatson-hand. Whowouldn’tlearn to love the stairs if there’s a free snack at the top? Here, some training tips from two certified experts to help your dog master the ultimate vertical trial.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nYour puppy training schedule, from eight weeks to six months. Let’s do this.\nWhy are some dogs afraid of stairs?\nFear of stairs is not overly common in adult dogs who’ve lived inside homes before, says Laurie Lawless, certified dog behavior consultant and owner ofShelter Behavior Integrations. Most often, she says, “I see it when dogs just have not been overly socialized, have not lived inside previously, or are just sensitive and fearful to a new environment.”\nSometimes, dogs’ anxiety might stem from thekindsof stairs you have in your home. Older houses, in particular, tend to have narrow or steep staircases, which can create stress or vision challenges. If the floor texture on your stairs differs from the rest of your home, that can factor in as well; some harder floors can leave dogs feeling unstable, which is less than ideal when they’re trying to climb.\nFloating stairs, which have gaps in between each step, can also scare dogs off, says Claren Mulhall, co-owner and head trainer atCloud K-9 Dog Training. From a dog’s angle, she points out, those sleek, modern steps will look like they’re full of holes. If your dog is cowering at the top or bottom, try throwing a blanket over them so that they appear solid.\n“Another consideration, and always my first consideration if I work with a dog who is afraid of stairs, is to rule out any medical causes,” Mulhall says. “A dog with knee or hip issues may be very uncomfortable or find it painful to use stairs, so they avoid them as much as possible.”\nIf your dog seems vehemently opposed to stairs, it’s worth checking with their veterinarian to make sure that their resistance is not a sign of bigger issues. The last thing you want is to make the condition worse by forcing them to push through it.\nHow can we help adult dogs who are afraid of stairs overcome their fears?\nJust like most people wouldn’t love to learn how to swim by being thrown into a freezing cold swimming pool, it’s important to be gradual and deliberate when training your dog to deal with stairs. Both Lawless and Mulhall emphasize the importance of starting small. (Think: starting with just one stair.) For many dogs, Mulhall adds, it might be easier to try going down the stairs first, rather than up.\n“Sit on the stairs with some yummy treats and encourage the dog to put a single paw on the step, then treat, then two paws and treat, etc.,” Mulhall says. “Don’t pull the dog up or down the stairs. Reward them with treats along the way.”\nLawless recommends throwing a treat away from the stairs after completing that same process. That little extra step can turn the exercise into a fun cat-and-mouse game while also creating an opportunity to seek consent from your dog to continue the training.\n“If you go back towards the first step and the dog doesn’t follow you, that’s a sign, to me, that the dog was a little overwhelmed, versus a dog who is like, ‘Oh, I’ll jump back on those stairs for another cookie,’” Lawless says.\nIf you don’t have stairs in your home but want to teach your dog how to handle them in other environments, you can use obstacles like blocks, large books, exercise platforms, and even your legs to get them used to the movement of picking up all their legs. Claren says that wherever you’re training, the most important thing you can do is to make sure that whatever your dog does at the end of the stairs is going to be a good time — a play session or some treats, perhaps. In other words, save theveterinarian’s front stepsfor another time.\nItispowerful enough, even for the tough cases, and itisthe best choice—here’s why.\nHow can we help puppies become comfortable around stairs?\nPuppies tend to be better at adjusting to new people, places, and things than older dogs, so if you have the chance to introduce your puppy to stairs, be sure to take advantage. If your puppy is still working on coordination and balance, Lawless recommends covering the stairs with something like a bath mat, a yoga mat, or even a roll of stair carpeting. This will ensure they don’t lose their footing. As always,treats will be your best friend.\nFrom there, Lawless recommends gently guiding your puppy up the first step or two, allowing them to take their time getting familiar with the surface. Don’t worry about the rest of the staircase just yet — wait until your puppy seems confident navigating that first step. And just like with adult dogs, let their interest be your guide. If your puppy seems reluctant to get back on, that’s probably a sign that it’s time to hit pause.\n“What we don’t want to do is force them up or down,” Lawless says. “We can definitely [overwhelm] them and then make them more fearful of the stairs. So it’s really important to not rush it.”\nToo often, Mulhall agrees, pet parents can try too much too soon. Her suggestion? “Work with what your dog can handle. Don’t try practicing with stairs when you’re in a hurry.” With young puppies especially, be mindful of theirphysical developmentto avoid overdoing things.\nDid you get a dog for emotional support and now they are the one who needs it?\nHow can I tell if training is overwhelming my dog?\nIt’s helpful to get to know all of the usual body language dogs use to convey stress, like stiff posture, darting eyes, andexcessive lip-licking. That said, there are a few specific behaviors that you might want to watch for while working with stairs.\nFirst, watch how your dog distributes their weight at the foot of the stairs. If they’re taking a step up but keep their back legs weighed to avoid putting too much weight on the step, it means that they’re not comfortable enough yet to ascend to the next step.\nStress panting is another sign to watch for. “Especially if they pant and look away from the stairs or look up at you, it means that they’re probably struggling with making that next step in a confident way,” Lawless says. “At that point, I would probably practice just teaching them to go up and down that first one or two sets of stairs with lots of treats, and doing that in very short sessions.”\nIf your home has stairs, Lawless recommends carrying your puppy up and down as needed, while they’re still in training. Don’t force your puppy to “sink or swim” by taking them all at once. The same goes for adult dogs. Avoid getting impatient and instead, focus on positively reinforcing the progress they’re making while taking things slow. If you have an extra-large dog who can’t be alone, consider sleeping downstairs with them overnight for a while as they build their skills.\n“This is a lifelong commitment,” Lawless says, “and it’s best to set yourself up for long-term success, versus forcing an issue — because that might end up putting you backwards.”\nOffering fewer treats can actually be agoodthing.\nWhen is it time to seek professional help?\nIt may be helpful to involve expert from the beginning. In addition to checking with your vet to rule out medical problems, Mulhall recommends seeking out acertified Fear Free trainerto help navigate the training process. Lawless, meanwhile, notes that for those who live on higher floors in apartment buildings with stairs, a professional can expedite the training progress and help your dog make faster progress than you might achieve on your own.\nWherever you are in your training journey, never fear. This kind of work takes time, and at times, it might feel like an uphill battle. But as the great Miley Cyrus once  said, it ain’t about how fast [your dog] gets there, ain’t about what’s waiting on the other side — it’s the climb.",

    "page_content": "Leaving your new puppy alone for the very first time will no doubt pull at your heart strings and have you searching for remote work opportunities. But it’s important to remember you can do hard things, and so can your puppy. The key is to be well-prepared and plan ahead so that your first few separations are successful and feel comfortable for you both.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nAt what age can you leave a puppy home alone?\nThere is no specific age when it is completely OK or not OK to leave a puppy home alone, and there are a number of factors to consider before leaving your pup solo. The first consideration is their age andstage of development. The more you understand about your puppy’s development, the better you can tailor your training and expectations to what is age-appropriate.\nBased on your puppy’s age and weight, you can estimate how often they need to eat, go poop and pee, and exercise. You should not leave your puppy alone long enough to interfere with these needs; this can be both distressing and unhealthy. For example, puppies that are only a few days or weeks old have very specific needs including feedings every few hours, maintaining proper body temperature with heat support, and stimulation to pee and poop.\nThey really cannot be left alone; they require nearly constant monitoring and care. As puppies get older, they can go longer stretches between meals and slowly learn to hold their pee and poop for longer periods of time. This can serve as a rough guide for when you can start to leave your puppy alone and for how long. Typically, this means waiting until your puppy is at least three months old to start some short, gradual separations. How youactuallydo that involves some planning and preparation.\nNot that you want to be away from them anyway.\nHow to leave a puppy home alone\nIntroducing the idea of being alone is an important part oftraining your puppy. You will want your puppy to develop a healthy independence and comfort in being alone, whether you are physically leaving the house, sleeping in separate rooms, or even just simply using the bathroom without a spectator. Here are some ways you can prepare your pup for these experiences:\nIt is very important to get in the habit of giving your puppy alone time even when you are home and not constantly carrying them around or smothering them with love (easier said than done, I know). This is a technique you can work on with younger puppies too well before you are ready to leave them home alone.\nThis may include giving them a safe toy or treat and setting them up to eat it in their own space like a playpen or crate while you leave the room for a few minutes. Encourage your puppy to have their own space and feel comfortable with you stepping away from them. This is a great first step to helping them feel confident when you’re out of sight.\nWhile you don’t have to have a completely house-trained puppy before leaving them alone, it is another important step toward their independence. Potty trainingcan take a whilefor puppies to master, and it’s important to keep in mind the limitations of their age and bladder control.\nVery young puppies simply cannot hold their urine for very long, so even if they manage to grasp the concept of house training, they have to be physically large enough to hold it for long periods of time. Knowing this can also help you set a realistic expectation for how long you can leave your puppy alone; you’ll want to be sure to stick to their potty training schedule and not miss a walk.\nWhenever your puppy is unsupervised, it’s important that they are confined to a safe and comfortable space. This is true even when you are home with them but preoccupied with other tasks, as well as when you plan to be out of the house. This is for their safety to ensure they cannot accessdangers like toxinsor situations that will lead to injury. It is also for their comfort so that they have a reliable routine and a familiar place that feels safe to them.\nPuppies are notorious for their ability to get into mischief in record time. If you have ever turned around momentarily just to find your puppy doing the unthinkable, you know how quickly it can happen. This is whypuppy-proofingis so important. Your puppy needs to have an area that is safe for them to explore and rest when you are not directly supervising them. This may be a crate, playpen, or a specific room that you can close off to keep your puppy safe.\nWhatever you decide to use as your puppy’s safe space, be sure to also make an effort to make it feel welcoming and safe to your puppy. Allow them to explore the space on their own and try to do fun things in that space daily, including playtime, treats, or meals. This will help them create a positive association with that space. Never lock them in this space as a punishment as this will create a negative association and can result in fear and anxiety when confined.\nSeparation anxietyis a specific condition in dogs characterized by high levels of fear and anxiety when they are left alone. It is not just an occasional problem but a chronic issue for the affected dogs. They have extreme reactions to being left alone that can lead to destructive behaviors, barking or whining nonstop, or peeing or pooping indoors, despite being fully potty trained.\nThese behaviors are not usually seen in young puppies but develop over time. Often, there is some sort of trauma that leads to this condition, such as moving to a new home, loss of a trusted person, or a major change in their routine and the amount of time they are left alone. However, other times the condition develops without a clear inciting cause. The best ways to prevent separation anxiety are to utilize tools to help your pup be confident, well-socialized, and well-trained. Gradually exposing your puppy to time alone and making it a positive experience is one way to do that. Additionally, having a predictable routine so your dog gets to know when to expect meals, playtime, and their walk schedule can reduce their anxiety.\nFinally, ensuring your pup getsplenty of exerciseand mental enrichment daily are well-known ways to reduce anxiety. Be sure to build that into your daily routine. For dogs that are already showing signs of separation anxiety, it is important to get professional help right away. This may involve a combination of training techniques, behavior modification, medications, and other solutions aimed at alleviating the most severe symptoms for your pup.\nDoes your dog freak out when you head for the door? Here’s some advice.\nCan I leave my puppy home alone for eight hours?\nThe short answer is no. Puppies should not be alone for eight hours. From a biological standpoint,they cannot hold their peeor poop that long and they need to eat frequently while they are growing rapidly. Even adult dogs really need a pee break every six hours. From a social-emotional point of view, this is also a very long time for puppies to go without social interactions, exercise, and mental enrichment.\nThere is a fairly shortsocialization window in puppy developmentwhen they are most amenable to new experiences, animals, and people. In order to be a well-adjusted puppy, they need to maximize exposure to those opportunities every day. A puppy who is alone for many hours is not able to experience the world around them and will be more at risk for behavioral problems as a result. Of course, life happens, and you probably need to work to afford all those new puppy supplies, so there may be days when you have to be out of the house for eight hours or more. This is where all of that crucial prepping and planning comes into play.\nIf you are planning to adopt a puppy in the near future, try to schedule as much vacation time as you can for those first critical weeks together and minimize your time out of the house. For the days you can’t be home, try to find a friend or family member to hang with your puppy and help them stick to their routine. Depending on where you live, you may also find options likedog walking services or doggie daycareswho can walk them, feed them, and even help with basic training.\nIt was a trick question. A study shows that the pandemic has made us all codependent.\nHow to crate train a puppy during the day\nCrate training is one common technique used to provide a safe and secure space for puppies to be left alone. Whencrate training your puppy, it’s important to create a positive association with the crate as a safe space and a place where good things happen. You can do this by encouraging your puppy to play with toys in the crate and by offering treats and food in the crate.\nYou’ll need to very gradually introduce times where your dog is confined in the crate and use lots of praise and treats when your puppy is calm and quiet in there. At first, you’ll want to have your pup adjust the crate while you are present. Over time, you can gradually move further and further away from the crate and even out of the room. It is important to keep these sessions short.\nTry to stop on a positive note when your dog is calm and quiet, as opposed to letting them out when they are barking or whining, which can unintentionally reinforce those behaviors. Eventually, you can start leaving the house for short periods of time while your dog is crated. It may help to set up a camera so you can observe how your dog reacts to being in the crate and to try to return before your dog gets too restless.\nCrates are intentionally designed to be on the smaller side, allowing a dog to turn around, stand up, and lay down comfortably but not to be able to do much more than that. This helps to discourage them from peeing and pooping in the crate, because they don’t have enough space to separate from it. For this reason, it is also not meant to be used for very long periods of time.\nMany puppies are not able to hold their pee and poop for hours so if they are crated for long periods of time, they will inevitably have an accident. The crate does not allow them to move around or exercise in the ways that puppies need to, so keep their periods of confinement short and set aside plenty of time for play and exercise before and after being crated.\nDon’t hit pause on your pet’s playtime – these solo activities will help 9-5 fly by for them.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nThis variesbased on their age and needsbut in general, puppies should not be left alone for more than a few hours, and they will need to be gradually acclimated to being left alone.\nIt is very important to have a safe, puppy-proof space prepared for your puppy when they are left alone. This protects them from dangers like toxins and injuries and provides a space where they feel safe and secure.\nReferences:\nAnimals: Impact of Changes in Time Left Alone on Separation-Related Behaviour in UK Dogs\nAnimals: Impact of Changes in Time Left Alone on Separation-Related Behaviour in UK Dogs\nTime: How Science is Revolutionizing the World of Dog Training\nTime: How Science is Revolutionizing the World of Dog Training\nVeterinary Partner: Separation Anxiety\nVeterinary Partner: Separation Anxiety",

    "page_content": "Just as the three most important factors in the value of a house are “location, location, location,” the three most important factors in dog training are “patience, patience, patience.” Teaching dogs to perform certain behaviors (and not to perform certain other behaviors) takes a lot of patience.\nSometimes, the progress is slow, and you will need to wait for it. Nobody said it better than writer Leo Tolstoy, “Patience is waiting. Not passively waiting. That is laziness. But to keep going when the going is hard and slow — that is patience. The two most powerful warriors are patience and time.”\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nOffering fewer treats can actually be agoodthing.\nTraining is a long-term project.\nTraining a dog is a lifelong endeavor; there are always new skills to teach them or to fine-tune. It helps them manage their emotions and their environment so they will succeed in training. Plus, this is not fully accomplished in an eight-week-long training class and certainly not in a one-day seminar. A long-term course of study is needed to train any dog — especially those with behavioral challenges,such as reactivity.\nSuccess takes a lot of time and practice. When I talk with clients about working with their dogs to teach them new skills — how to behave appropriately around the house, to help them overcome their fear of strangers, to be able to take a walk without becoming unhinged at the sight of another dog, or to learn to respond to cues in distracting environments — I often say, “Think in terms of weeks and months, not days or hours.” This is to convey the importance of thinking long-term.\nWhat to do when your best-laid training plans are sabotaged.\nSetbacks are inevitable.\nAlthough progress may be consistent, it will not likely be steady throughout the process. It’s not easy to be patient, especially when you experience a setback, but that’s just how training is. Sometimes, you are working with a dog who is reactive to other dogs, and anoff-leashpup comes out of nowhere.\nOr, another scenario: A dog who has a hard time meeting people might be receiving treats from a person with whom they have recently become comfortable. Suddenly, a car alarm goes off, frightening your dog who now fears this person as much as they used to.\nOr maybe your dog is not feeling well or is sleepy, causing a decline in their performance that you can’t explain at the moment. It takes your own fortitude to accept that progress will be uneven and that there may be times when the dog regresses, either for obvious reasons or for reasons you don’t understand.\nThere may be a need to change strategies or try new ways to help the dog.\nWhen working with reactive dogs, some do best by learning to “watch” or do a “u-turn” to keep them from seeing their trigger. Other dogs respond best by learning that the trigger is a cue to run for fun or to play tug, meaning they actually become happy upon seeing what used to upset them. Sometimes, it takes some trial and error to figure out what will be most effective, and that can be exhausting.\nSwitching up the reinforcement can be a powerful strategy, but some dogs prefer the predictability of the same reinforcement in a tough situation. Not every strategy works or works best for every dog. Flexibility is key, but it will be a challenge to abandon one method and start anew with another, even if it is the right thing to do. It’s analogous to people trying multiple techniques or even multiple therapists to improve their emotional state, behavior, and quality of life.\nIt’s like your 30-day yoga challenge — except with way more training treats.\nPatience is a relationship enhancer.\nPracticing patience is good for the relationship, preventing frustration and unreasonable expectations. It’s imperative that you work at the speed your dog can go, not the speed youwishyour dog could go. Give them the gift of as much patience as they need. Accepting them for who they are includes accepting the pace at which they can go. I used to have a dog who was rarely quick to learn anything new. Bugsy often took weeks to learn what I could teach most dogs in one or two sessions.\nIt took patience and somuch repetitionto teach him any new tricks or skills. It was a wonderful lesson in the importance of patiently accepting a dog for who he is because if I had lacked the ability to keep trying, our training journey together would have been pointless. With patience, it was successful, enjoyable, and educational for both of us. I am grateful to him every day, though it’s been years since his passing.Even for dogs who learn at a more typical rate or those who learn especially quickly, repetition is just a part of training.\nMany dogs need lots of experiences meeting new people to be able to handle introductions calmly and politely. It’s common for dogs to need to practice skills in new situations and contexts. Just because adog can come when calledat home doesn’t mean they can do it at the park. It takes a lot of patience to practice the same skill in a variety of increasingly difficult contexts until the dog can respond appropriately to a cue in a whole bunch of places and not just in a few.\nIt takes a long time to change how a dog feels, especially about something scary.\nSo much of working with dogs with behavioral issues involves addressing how they feel. Many behavioral issues are not training issues, meaning that the dog is not acting the way they are (barking out the windowat trucks,lunging at other dogs, growling at strangers, etc.) because they lack training but rather because they are afraid or too highly aroused.\nYes, training will be apartof changing their behavior, but the issue is how they feel, and that’s what any work to change their behavior must focus on. Intuitively, we can understand that changing the way the dog feels is not something that can happen overnight in most cases, and that makes it easier to be patient.\nBehavioral change takes time.\nNot every session or every day will feel successful, at least not to the degree you might have hoped when you began the day. It’s important to let the satisfaction and pride come from your efforts and the process, even if the results don’t always look as you’d like. The daily work and effort lead to improvements over the long haul.\nBetter behavior and more success for your dog happen slowly most of the time. Although the occasional big breakthrough should be celebrated, most progress is incremental. It takes patience to wait for it and to be at peace with the fact that behavioral change takes time.\nBe patient with yourself.\nIt’s emotionally exhausting and hard work to change a dog’s behavior and teach them new skills. You may make mistakes and feel regret. Offer yourself the same gift of patience you give your dogs. They deserve your patience, andyoudeserve it, too.\nThe importance of patience is a timeless idea. It was long ago in the 13thcentury that the Persian poet Saadi so simply and beautifully stated, “Have patience. All things are difficult before they are easy.” I wonder, could he also have been a dog trainer?",

    },
    "page_content": "The first week of October means it’s definitely officially fall and not too early to pull out those Halloween decorations. It also means, depending on where you live, that you can start crunching through the fall leaves while taking your pup for a walk. What better week to do that then National Walk Your Dog Week?\nOf course, this isn’t the only week you and your pal should pound the pavement of your neighborhood or hit a nearby trail. You’ll want to create a routine that you both can depend on. Consider these factors to establish an ideal walking schedule catered to your dog’s fitness needs.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nStep one: Consider your dog’s age, activity level, and breed traits.\nHigher-energy breeds, like herding and sporting dog, require 30 to 60 minutes of vigorous exercise daily, including longer jogs or runs. In contrast, lower-energy or senior dogs may only need one or two shorter 15-minute walks.\nStep two: Assess their physical condition.\nNote your dog’s physical condition and fitness, which are visible in muscle tone, ideal body condition score, endurance, and mobility. Make walking a priority for overweight dogs or those losing strength from arthritis. Remember, active, athletic dogs need more challenging walks to stay fit.\nStep three: Gauge their enthusiasm and engagement on walks.\nDogs who pull persistently near the end or fixate on chasing things need a bigger outlet for pent-up energy. If ignored, this can turn into destructive behavior.\nThere’s such a thing as too much of a good thing.\nStep four: Change it up.\nRotate different locations and routes to provide mental stimulation with the new territory, sights, and smells. Dogs who walk frequently benefit mentally from visiting novel areas.\nStep five: Monitor your dog’s energy levels.\nWatch for signs your dog tuckers out on walks, like lagging far behind, seeking shade, heavy uncontrolled panting, or refusing to move on. End walks before exhaustion sets in.\nStep six: Watch for signs of heat stroke.\nAvoidheat strokeby walking early or late in the day when the pavement is cooler. Provide your pup with ample shade and water breaks.\nBlue is a good name for a dog—not a good mood.\nHow often should you walk your dog?\nFirst, let’s be clear: There’s a difference between letting your dog out to pee and going for a walk. When it comes to pee breaks, “adult dogs need to be let out for bathroom breaks a minimum of three times a day,” says Dr. Ashley Rossman, a veterinarian atGlen Oak Dog and Cat Hospital. “Puppies need even more than that, especially when they’re not yethousebroken.” Beyond that, how much time your dog needs to burn off energy will depend on their age and breed.\nIt can feel tricky to figure out exactly how much to walk a dog, because there are no hard-and-fast rules. You’ll have to consider a few different factors, including age and breed. “Younger dogs have more energy than older dogs, obviously, and will need more time to walk or run around,” Dr. Rossman says. “Older dogs, especially ones dealing with issues like arthritis, may need shorter walks to avoid causing additional pain.\nWorking dogs — think Retrievers and Sheepdogs — need at least 30 minutes of significant exercise.” (Those of you with working-group puppies: hope you’ve got good running shoes.) In general, larger dogs arerecommended to get more exercisethan smaller dogs.\nHow often you walk your dog will also depend on whether you have a yard, per Lauren Novack, a certified dog behavior consultant atBehavior Vetsin NYC. If a dog has free run of the yard, they’re not going to need as formal an exercise routine as a pet whose idea of open space is the hallway from the bedroom to the front door. Still, Novack says people tend to under-exercise their dogs — especially small ones.\nTips you’ll want to pay attention to.\nOn top of age and breed, there’s another factor that can affect the length and quality of your dog’s walk:heat. “Walks in the summer are tricky,” Dr. Rossman admits. While you can bundle a dog up in the winter, there’s less you can do to manage the temperature on a warm day. So if it’s hot and sunny (temps above 80 degrees Farhrenheit), don’t keep your dog out for too long.” During the summer, early morning or evening walks are your safest options to keep your pet from burning their paw pads or overheating.\n“Heat exhaustionis very real, and the emergency rooms see many cases,” Dr. Rossman adds. Some breeds are more prone to overheating, like Malamutes or Huskies, because they’re bred for colder weather. Older dogs and sick pets can struggle in the heat, too, as canbrachycephalic breeds, such as Pugs, Bulldogs, and Boxers.\n“Always remember to bring drinking water for your pet,” she says. “And don’t go hiking midday — if you do, make sure you’re seeking out trails that have plenty of shade so your dog has a way to stay cool.” But a hot day isn’t an excuse to veg out: Keep your dog moving indoors with an old-school tug-of-war session or interactivedog puzzle toys.\nIt’s good for you both — promise.\n“An hour-long walk every day is generally a good recommendation — preferably all in one session,” Novack says. “A long walk benefits a dog’s physical body as well as their mental health. The problem with a 15-minute walk is that you’re not going anywhere new.” If you can’t time block your calendar for an hour-long walk a day, consider hiring adog walkerto ensure your dog gets the exercise they need — even if you’re working from home.\nWhat are the benefits of dog walking?\nStudies findthat most dogs aren’t getting the recommended amount of exercise, which is a big problem. Walking a dog is a great source of exercise and can have enormous impacts on a dog’s quality of life — and their pet parent’s. Below are a few of the benefits of walking a dog.\nDog-walking is great for the physical health ofboth you and your pup. Regular walking is associated with alower risk of cardiovascular disease in humans, and lack of exercise is associated withobesity in dogs, which can lead to a handful of health concerns.\nDogs thrive on variety just like we do, so if they’re stuck in the same loop, they’ll eventually find it uninspiring. And dogs who aren’t getting enough exercise become something worse than couch potatoes.\n“If you’re not walking your dog enough or providing them with enough playtime, they can becomeanxiousordestructive,” says Dr. Sara Ochoa, a veterinarian atWhitehouse Veterinary Hospital. “They might tear up the house or start licking their paws obsessively.” That energy has to go somewhere, and sometimes it’s going to go into chewing all the wires behind the TV.\nSocialization is incredibly important for dogs —especially puppies— and dog walking is a great opportunity to introduce your pup to the dogs and people of the world. For puppies, going for walks can help them learn how tointeract with other dogs and peopleand readdog body language, plus prevent them from developingphobias.\nWalking a dog is a great opportunity for humans to socialize, too; many peoplesee a dog as a conversational “icebreaker”when meeting people in public. Given thatloneliness has been declared a public health crisisby the US Surgeon General, meeting new human friends at the dog park is a welcome side-effect of some puppy bonding time.\nWalking with your dog gives the two of you plenty of quality time together, andthis helps you strengthen your bond. When the time you spend together is fun, it sends a message to your pup that they can trust you. Animal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London recommends taking your dog on a “sniffari” to take the fun up a notch.\nPhysical activity should be fun.\nThat said, not all dogs like walking. It makes sense — you may prefer a bike over a treadmill, right? Novack suggests finding a form of activity that excites your dog, like playing fetchor swimming. Your dog may even master anagility course. Researching what your dog’s breed traditionally enjoys can help, too.\nDon’t let your new dogwalk you.\nOr maybe it’s you who doesn’t like walks because your dogpulls on their leashor is aggressive toward other animals. “In that case, trytraining techniquesandwalking geartohelp your dog heel, or walk them when you’re less likely to see other dogs, like late at night,” Dr. Ochoa says. (Peak dog-walking hours tend to be right after rush hour, when people get home from work.)\nThe next time they try to kiss your face while you’re in corpse pose, let them.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nAccording to certified dog trainer Lauren Novack, an hour-long walk every day is generally a good recommendation. Specific needs depend on the breed and age of your dog.\nIdeally, you should walk your dog every day.\nThere’s not one ideal walking schedule for dogs; the best time to walk your dog is whenever fits in best with your and your pup’s day. In hot weather, you may want to walk your dog in the early morning or late evening, when the temperature is lower and the ground is not too hot.\nYou can feed a dog before or after exercise, but it’simportant to wait about an hour before or after the walk. Feeding too soon before or after physical activity can be bad for your pup’s digestion — and it can even be dangerous, since eating soon after exercise may cause them to inhale more air when eating, which canlead to bloat.\nThere are several factors to consider to keep your walk safe. It’s important for you, your pup’s, and your community’s safety that your dog isleash trained. Always use properexercise equipment. Keep your pup hydrated and safe fromany harsh weather.\nWalking a dog is important for your dog’s emotional and physical health. It also promotes bonding and provides an opportunity for you and your dog to socialize.\nReferences:\nVariation in Activity Levels Amongst Dogs of Different Breeds\nVariation in Activity Levels Amongst Dogs of Different Breeds\nFactors Associated With Daily Walking of Dogs\nFactors Associated With Daily Walking of Dogs\nI Walk My Dog Because It Makes Me Happy: A Qualitative Study to Understand Why Dogs Motivate Walking and Improved Health\nI Walk My Dog Because It Makes Me Happy: A Qualitative Study to Understand Why Dogs Motivate Walking and Improved Health\nUnderstanding How Dogs Encourage and Motivate Walking\nUnderstanding How Dogs Encourage and Motivate Walking\nHow Might We Increase Physical Activity Through Dog Walking?\nHow Might We Increase Physical Activity Through Dog Walking?",

    "page_content": "Your dogbites at the forelegof another dog at the park. Aggression? No, it’s verylikely playful. A dog’s mouth is open, and they appear to be grinning. Plotting an attack? Nope, once again, it’s far more likely to be playful.\nOne dog is batting at another dog with their paws. Did they confuse this event with a boxing match? Not at all, because using their paws like this is a really common way to get play going with other pups. Elbows on the ground, behind up in the air, tail actively engaged? Having a good stretch? Well, however much it may resemble a stretch, in this context, it is almost surely playful. You may know that’s a play bow, but humans don’t understand most other play signals very well—whether our dog is displaying them for us or another dog. That’s unfortunate, because if we did, we would understand our pets so much better.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThe idea of a play signal — a behavior that requests play from a potential playmate or indicates that play is coming, is a great one. I mean, seriously, how great is it to have a way to communicate that you want to play and to invite someone to join? The following behaviors are good signs that your dog wants you to understand that they want the games to begin.\nPlay bow\nThe play bow is the best-known play signal and universally recognizable. This behavior consists of a dog placing their elbows and lower part of their forelegs on the ground while their back end stays up. The back often curves, the tail is frequently in a high position and wagging, and the forelegs are often turned out to form a “V,” rather than being parallel to each other.\nPlay bows frequently occur before dogs begin to play, and they also occur in between bouts of play, perhaps to ease tensions, make a hesitant dog more comfortable, or to keep play going longer. People can perform play bows to start play with their dogs, or even do a standing human version in which we bend our knees suddenly or even sort of hop into a partial squat and spread our arms out in a low V.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nPlay face\nThere’s a particular facial expression that is considered an invitation to play, and it is not unique to dogs; in fact, it is called the “mammalian play face.” It’s seen in many animals including canids and primates, and it was first described by Charles Darwin. In this expression, dogs have relaxed facial muscles, an open mouth that looks similar to a smile with slightly open jaws, and the lips pulled back sideways (not vertically).\nGently biting front paw of playmate\nDogs often initiate play by biting the front paw of a potential playmate. They don’t bite hard in this context but rather in a controlled, inhibited, gentle way. Many dogs respond to this play initiation attempt positively by mouthing back at the other dog, or starting to play with chasing or wrestling.\nMany humans become alarmed when a dog mouths at their arm and become angry or scared, and that’s why this play signal is not generally effective at initiating play with people. I prefer not to respond to this behavior by a dog with play because I generally like when dogs avoid having their teeth on my skin.\nBatting at a playmate with a paw\nBoxing or batting their front paws at a potential playmate is a common way to signal an interest in play. The play may continue with a lot of paw action or morph into another kind of play — wrestling, chasing, body slamming, or mouthing at each other’s faces. Some dogs commonly use this signal at the start of play but others don’t.\nEven dogs who don’t bat their paws at others tend to understand the meaning of this behavior. Most humans don’t, though, and that leads to a common communication failure between people and dogs. If a dog leaps up at a person, and the person attempts to stop this behavior by pushing the dog down with their hands, many dogs interpret this as a play signal andget even more jumpyand bouncy.\nThis often results in a person pushing at the dog but getting annoyed that the dog keeps jumping. Then, the dog will keep jumping, only to be confused and heartbroken that they’re being yelled at or grabbed roughly by the person. The poor dog! They understandably think the person wants to play but then become alarmed when the person seems angry with them for trying to play, too.\nThe internet has a lot to tell you about your new addition. Here’s what’s actually true.\nRolling over (in a particular way)\nAnother play signal involves a dog lowering themselves close to the ground and twisting their upper body so they are partly on their back with one shoulder, and then the other lands on the ground. They end up going belly-up just a split second later, right near the head of another dog. Sometimes after they roll over in this way, they then either bat their paws at the face of the other dog or give a very inhibited bite to the dog’s front paws.\nInitiating play without formal signals\nSometimes, dogs act in a particular way that seems to get play going, but they aren’t technically showing play signals. In these instances, it’s not so much that they are communicating their desire to play or assuring another dog that what follows is playful in nature, but rather they just act playful, and then the other dog joins in.\nOne way of initiating play without a formal play signal is to start a chase. A dog can do this either by running toward or away from the other dog. Here are some playful communications: If the dog runs in circles around the other dog; if they run with bouncy movements that are unlike the way dogs run when they are serious (serious meaning either running in the opposite direction to get away or running toward the other dog to attack); or they approach and then retreat from the other dog multiple times.\nAnother way that a dog can entice another dog to play is to hold a toy and wave it about near that pup or calmly approach and offer them one end of a toy that can be used toplay tug. If the other dog takes one end of the toy in their mouth, the first dog may wait a beat to make sure the other dog has a good grip on the toy and then begin to pull in earnest. In each of these cases, the playful intentions were obvious, and that’s important for avoiding misunderstandings.\nChase? Wrestle? Tug-o-war? Find out which are fair game.\nSkipping play signals\nPlay signals are essential in most cases but are sometimes skipped among regular playmates, especially within a household. Dogs who play together regularly, especially if they live together or see each other every day, sometimes don’t bother with play signals. It seems it is just assumed that the behavior is playful so there is no need to “say” so explicitly. It’s much like human siblings who suddenly leap out at each other to surprise or scare each other or suddenly start to wrestle — everyone understands that nobody is being attacked and that this apparently rough or aggressive behavior is actually playful. There’s no confusion because it is clearly intended to be in good fun.\nThe trouble comes when people who are used to skipping play signals with close friends or family members act the same way with other people, who don’t understand they are just playing. The person on the receiving end can become startled or alarmed. A person might jump onto their brother’s back unexpectedly, leading to a laugh and some wrestling, but if that same person jumps on the back of a random stranger, the responsemay be a fight, even if the leaper had playful intentions.\nThe same is true for dogs. They may be able to charge at and start wrestling with their best buddy, as they have done many times with everyone having fun. However, charging at and starting to wrestle with an unknown dog can lead to real trouble. The other dog might naturally seek to defend themselves from what they perceive as an attack.\nIn praise of play signals\nDogs are good at initiating play, and a big part of their process is using play signals to communicate that play is the plan.

But you also don’t want to expose your puppy to environments where they have the chance to contract potentially life-threatening illnesses.\nThe general rule is that puppies can go outside to public spaces like parks and dog parks about two weeks after their second round of vaccinations. But what should you do with your energetic pup in the meantime?Should you really keep them trapped inside, hidden away from the world like a fairytale princess?\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhile you should always consult with your vet first, we offer some general guidance onhow to socialize your puppywithout risking their health in the outside world.\nTips you’ll want to pay attention to.\nFactors to consider before bringing your puppy outside\nThe more new things a puppy encounters in their first weeks of life (new sounds, sights, and experiences), the better set they are for success as they grow into an adult dog. But for a young, unvaccinated puppy, the outside world can be full of danger that pet parents can’t see, even on a simplewalk at the park.\nThe younger a puppy is, the higher the risk of them contracting an illness from their environment or another dog. Young puppies also don’t have the benefit of core vaccines to protect them, so it’s important to keep your puppy away from public outdoor spaces as much as possible.\nVeterinarians recommend keeping your puppy away from public spaces until they are fully vaccinated with their core vaccines. Doing so can help minimize the risk of your puppy contracting an illness that could be fatal. About two weeks after your puppy receives their final core vaccine, they can safely go outside and be around other dogs and people, whether at the park or inpuppy training classes. Ask your vet for a specific timeline for your pet.\n“Most puppies that have followed a routine vaccination schedule will finish around 16 weeks,”Dr. Katja LangatHeart of Chelsea Veterinary Groupsays. “It takes two weeks for the body immune system to build up antibodies following certain vaccinations.”\nTo help them grow into friendly, confident dogs and prevent future behavior issues, all puppies needproper socialization. For puppies, themost critical socialization periodis when they’re three to 12 weeks old, but they won’t be fully vaccinated until they’re at least 18 weeks old. What’s a dog parent to do?\nHelp your puppy experience as much of the world as possible from the safety of your home:\nTake them on a leash into a driveway or other road-facing area so they can watch people and animals, traffic, and local wildlife.\nTake them on a leash into a driveway or other road-facing area so they can watch people and animals, traffic, and local wildlife.\nPlay noises in your home that your puppy may eventually experience outside, like the sounds of traffic.\nPlay noises in your home that your puppy may eventually experience outside, like the sounds of traffic.\nExplore the inside of your home and outside areas around the house or apartment building by carrying your puppy.\nExplore the inside of your home and outside areas around the house or apartment building by carrying your puppy.\nThe biggest concern for puppies going outside is that they may be exposed to illnesses from another dog or the environment. Any dog at yourlocal dog parkcould potentially be sick, or a sick dog could have contaminated the environment, and you would have no way of knowing. This is why puppies shouldn’t be allowed in public outside areas until they have received all their core vaccines.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nWhen can puppies go outside for the first time?\nSo, when exactly can your puppy go outside safely? That depends on what you mean by “outside.” If you live in an area with a communal outside space, you may want to opt forpee padsin your home to ensure your puppy doesn’t come into contact with any potential diseases. However, if you have a fenced yard or garden, your puppy is safe to explore with supervision.\n“If you have a private outdoor area (without paw traffic from other dogs), puppies can go outside to eliminate,” Dr. Lang says. “They should not be walked outside on sidewalks, streets, or parks where other dogs have been.”\nTake advantage of private outside spaces around your home, like a patio, garden, or fenced area. These places can allow your puppy to explore the world safely, which is critical to theirearly socialization. You can even set up a puppy pen so you can both comfortably relax outside — and so you don’t have to worry about chasing your pup all over the yard.\nVaccination guidelines and outdoor access\nThe timeline for puppy vaccination may vary from dog to dog, but your vet can help you determine the right schedule for all your puppy’s core vaccines. Puppies are usually considered “done” with their vaccinations once they have received all of their DAPP vaccine series, which protects them against distemper, adenovirus, parainfluenza, and parvovirus.\nBut how long after the second puppy vaccination can they go outside? Most vets recommend around two weeks after receiving the last round of vaccines, a puppy is fully vaccinated andsafe to mingle with other dogsand humans.\nPrior to complete vaccination, your puppy is more susceptible to several common dog diseases, including:\nParvovirus\nParvovirus\nDistemper virus\nDistemper virus\nKennel cough (Bordetella, parainfluenza virus, and influenza virus)\nKennel cough (Bordetella, parainfluenza virus, and influenza virus)\nLeptospirosis\nLeptospirosis\nAdenovirus and rabies, both of which are highly unlikely but still possible\nAdenovirus and rabies, both of which are highly unlikely but still possible\nMany of these diseases don’t have a treatment currently available or can cost thousands of dollars to treat, so it’s best to protect your puppy as much as possible.\n“As a veterinarian, the disease I worry most about in puppies with immatureimmune systems is parvovirus,” Dr. Lang says. “Puppies are at highest risk since they need to complete the full round of vaccination to be protected. Parvo is a potentially fatal virus that causes severe gastrointestinal signs and affects their white blood cells.”\nDon’t let your new dogwalk you.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nIt’s generally safe for your puppy to go outside in your backyard, as long as you haven’t had any sick animals there in the last year or so. Your yard is a controlled environment, particularly if it’s fenced, which ensures that your pup is protected. But you should avoid dog parks and other public spaces until your puppy has received all their core vaccines.\nTo ensure your puppy is properly socialized in their first three months of life, it’s important to make sure they spend some time outside exploring the world. Be sure to handle yourpuppy’s socializationin a way that keeps them safe from contracting disease since they’re not yet fully vaccinated. This can include spending time in the front yard watching the neighborhood, going for car rides, and exploring around the house.\nBefore your puppy is fully vaccinated, you can carry them outside so they can still see, hear, and smell the world around them. Just be sure not to let your puppy interact with other dogs and people and avoid putting their paws on the ground if possible.\nReferences:\nImmunology\nImmunology\nWSAVA Guidelines for the Vaccination of Dogs and Cats\nWSAVA Guidelines for the Vaccination of Dogs and Cats\nVeterinarian Warns of Parvo Risk for Puppies at Parks\nVeterinarian Warns of Parvo Risk for Puppies at Parks\nImmune Responses to rAAV6: The Influence of Canine Parvovirus Vaccination and Neonatal Administration of Viral Vector\nImmune Responses to rAAV6: The Influence of Canine Parvovirus Vaccination and Neonatal Administration of Viral Vector\nPuppy Vaccination and Socialization Should Go Together\nPuppy Vaccination and Socialization Should Go Together\nCurrent Vaccination Strategies in Puppies and Kittens\nCurrent Vaccination Strategies in Puppies and Kittens",

    },
    "page_content": "If you scroll long enough on Tiktok (and who hasn’t?), you’ll inevitably stumble across a video of something humanity once only dreamed of: a talking dog. It’s not science fiction. For the past few years, pet parents have been teaching their dogs (and cats!) how to use speech buttons to receive cues and communicate their desires. Some,like an iconic Sheepadoodle named Bunny,have gatheredmillions of devoted followers.\nBut, welcome to the internet: There are a whole lot of naysayers. In the comments, many people question how well the speech buttons really work, and whether or not pets are really understanding language when they communicate with them.In a new studypublished inPLOS One, researchers looked for answers — and they found that dogs do in fact understand words spoken by speech buttons.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nThe experiments\nDr. Federico Rossano, a professor at the University of California San Diego, and his colleagues carried out experiments with 59 dogs who had been trained to use speech buttons. The experiments took place in the dogs’ homes.\nIn the first experiment, a researcher pressed buttons and recorded the dog’s behavior; the researcher was unable to hear what the button said, and the word on the button was covered with tape. The buttons said words related to play, outside, and food: the play words were “play” or “toy,” the outside words were  “out” or “outside,” and the food words were “food,” “eat,” “dinner,” or “hungry.”\nThis study findsthat dogs can process numbers in a similar fashion to their humans.\nThe researchers wanted to observe if the dogs would “behave in anticipation of the actions or events indicated by these words,' they wrote. Some behaviors they looked out for were picking up a toy after hearing “play” or looking to a food bowl after hearing “food.”\nIn the second experiment, with a new group of dogs, pet parents themselves either pressed the button or spoke the cue out loud. There were multiple trials, and each dog experienced both a pressed and spoken word.\nThe results\nResearchers found that across experiments, the dogs showed play behaviors seven times more often after hearing a “play” button than they did on average after hearing any of the three buttons. The same was true for outside behaviors. Interestingly, they did not show more food-related behaviors after hearing the food-related cues. The findings were true whether a researcher or pet parent pressed the button or said the word aloud.\nIf only there were dogJeopardy!.\nThese results indicate that dogs are likely truly listening to speech buttons — and not just reacting to their pet parents’ body language. “Here we show that actually [dogs] do pay attention to the [soundboard] words and they produce appropriate behaviors independently of environmental cues and who produces the word,”Dr. Rossano toldThe Guardian.\nGranted, these results aren’t jaw-dropping. It’s pretty well established thatdogs can understand many words— Rossano admits this himself. “While this study is most certainly not mind-blowing, it is a necessary first step,” he toldThe Guardian. The researchers hope to aim future studies on how many (and what kind of) words dogs can understand using buttons, as well as whether or not dogs can use buttons themselves to produce appropriate responses.",

    },
    "page_content": "Dogs go for walks on leashes. Simple, right? Except for one not-so-minor detail: you have toteachthem how to do it. Though it may seem instinctual for some dogs, leash work is a learned skill that usually takes some serious pet parent patience. You’ll want to start early, because a bouncy puppy who pulls, chews, or jumps on strangers might be cute, but an unruly adult dog (yes, even the little ones) is a lot less charming.\nWe asked Lauren Novack, a dog behaviorist, how to prevent yourself from becomingthatperson being dragged down the street by their 100-pound Mastiff or tangled up in the leash of their five-pound Chihuahua. Here, her tips on how to get your puppy to walk calmly by your side and what gear to use to accomplish that.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWouldyouwant a stranger coming right up to your face?\nThe basics of leash-training a puppy\nIf you’re feeling overwhelmed by all the to-dos of training a puppy, here’s the good news: “Puppyhood is an excellent opportunity for leash-training since puppies tend to follow their owners around pretty closely already,” Novack says. “You can start as soon as you bring them home.” Leash-training, by definition, just means teaching your dog to walk by your side and check in with you before sniffing out anything else in the environment. (That means no pulling or yanking!)\nThe main struggle with leash-training is that you’ll be competing with a big, interesting world — filled with squirrels, street pizza, and still more squirrels — for your pet’s attention. “Keep training sessions short and remember to break for playtime,” Novack says. “Think: two-minute bursts of leash-training, break for some play, then repeat for 15 minutes total.”\nWondering how long this whole process is gonna take? “Puppies are really easy and can probably be fully leash-trained in a month,” Novack says, but also cautions to be wary of the“teenage” phasethat dogs go through at around nine months old. “When they hit adolescence, they’re going to pretend they’ve never learned anything. Be ready to reinforce training and deal with some boundary pushing.”\nThe leash-training gear you’ll need\n“While you can train a dog with just acollar, a harnessis safer on their necks — especially growing puppies,” Novack recommends. If you ever notice your dog coughing while pulling on the leash, it’s a good idea to switch to a harness. But if your dog is easily distracted, ahead haltiecan correct that by literally turning their head toward you when you need them to focus.\nAfour- to six-foot leashwill give you the most control over your dog. “A retractable leash will teach your dog to pull,” Novack says. And when they pull, they go wherever they want (notwhat you want). Retractable leashes are also very dangerous, because a dog could dart out into traffic before you have a chance to reel them in.\n“Peoplegive dogs treatsthat are way too big,” Novack says. “Treats should be the size of a pea.” You can even use kibble if your dog is excited by it, and essentially feed them their dinner throughout a training session without any additional calories. The point is: you don’t want them to have to stop to chew and delay the lesson.\nIf you are not using your dog’s meal as a reward because it is not high enough value, be sure to limit the calories your dog gets over the course of the day. So, if you are training your dog using a lot of yummy treats, you want to give them a little less breakfast or dinner to help your dog from gaining unnecessary weight.\nDepending on your dog, you may need to use something much more enticing and smelly than just kibble as a reward. Sometimes, it’s good to mix your dog’s kibble with low sodium turkey hot dogs. That way, you are getting the best of both worlds. When the hot dogs are mixed in with the bag with the kibble, they begin to rub off their smell and flavor on the pieces of kibble, making it a bit more enticing.\nThe top steps to leash-train your puppy\nAn easy first step before you officially get training is to give our pup a chance to adjust to their new gear. Before you start walking your pup, you can suit them up and let them get used to their leash and harness inside. This will help make their transition to training time a little calmer.\nIn the ultimate irony, Novack recommends officially beginning leash-training by letting your puppyoff leash. “You don’t actually need a leash to teach your dog to pay attention to you and to walk by your side,” she says. Mind-blowing, we know. “The leash should be thought of more like a seatbelt than a primary tool — it’s there to keep your dog safe if an overwhelming stimulus makes them want to chase after it or run into traffic. Basically, the leash shouldn’t be the reason why your dog is by your side.”\nBut wait — don’t let your pup off leash just anywhere. Pick a location either indoors or in a fenced-in backyard (never anywhere unfenced — and no,invisible fencesdon’t count) where distractions are minimal. Now it’s time to teach them to walk next to you sans leash…\nYou do this by training your dog to think that next to your leg is the best place to be. Novack advises “building value” at that sweet spot by holding a treat there — right where your pup would be when you’re walking them. Without reaching out or prompting your puppy by touching your leg, let them come to the side of your leg to take it. Once you’ve mastered that, slowly take steps forward, treating your pet continuously as you walk, again making sure you’re doling out the treats right at your leg.\nOnce they comprehend that being by your side equals treats, stop holding the treat there the whole time. Instead, take a step forward and wait for your pup to follow suit before treating them. You can then take more and more steps forward — two, 10, and so on — before they get a treat.\nAt some point in the process of teaching your pup to stay by your side, layer in a leash so you can take them outside, challenging your pup to stay focused when there are distractions (squirrels) around.\nRemember to stay alert!\nOne you’ve got your pup sticking by your side without a steady flow of treats, it’s time to literally loosen the leash. You might come up with a verbal cue to let your dog know it’s okay to explore. Say there’s a pee spot they love to sniff — if they’re loosely by your side and look up to check in with you, you can say, “Okay, go sniff,” and they’ll know they have the green light to leave your side.\nJust be sure not to start moving where they pull you. “What you want them to learn is that the fastest, easiest way to get what they want is by staying loosely by your side,” Novack says. “Pulling shouldn’t get them anywhere.”\nThis rock-climbing technique can take your dog-walking skills to the next level.\nLeash-training in different locations and seasons\nSome other factors to consider when leash-training your puppy are location and season. While “leash-training a dog uses the same basic tools wherever you are, people in the city often have to be way more on top of their training,” Novack says. “In a city as big as New York City, for example, a simple pee break could involve an untold number of distractions. Meanwhile, if you have a backyard in the suburbs, your dog may go on fewer walks and a less-than-perfect heel is no big deal.\n“It’s important for dogs to be acclimated to all weather conditions,” adds Novack. “But if you live where there are extreme weather conditions for much of the year, a few extra pieces of gear may help.” A coat can help keep your dog warm in frigid temperatures, and booties will protect their paws from the salt that melts snow.” She also recommends treat tubes — squeeze tubes in flavors like peanut butter — which are easier to use when you’re wearing gloves.\nDoes your dog untangle themselves from a leash?\nDifferences between leash-training puppies and older dogs\nWhile both puppies and older dogs can be trained to walk on a leash, there are some differences between teaching young and old dogs.\nPuppies typically have higher energy levels than senior pups — and their attention spans are probably shorter. When training a puppy, you may want to train in short, enthusiastic bursts and provide lots of breaks. A senior dog is likely calmer and able to handle a longer training session, but those sessions should be slower paced to match their energy level.\nUnlike puppies, senior dogs may have already established some undesired habits. It may require more patience, consistency, and time to teach a senior dog a new way to behave. Don’t lose hope, and never punish your pup. Use positive reinforcement to reward a senior dog for good behavior.\nThe benefits of leash-training\nThere are plenty of great reasons to leash-train your pup — for both pets and pet parents.\nSafety: When your pup knows how to stay close to you on a leash, you’re both able to walk stress-free and remain aware of your surroundings.\nSafety: When your pup knows how to stay close to you on a leash, you’re both able to walk stress-free and remain aware of your surroundings.\nBonding: Leash-training helps pups bond to pet parents and improves trust.\nBonding: Leash-training helps pups bond to pet parents and improves trust.\nHealth: When walks are calm and easy, it incentivizes pups and pet parents alike to go out strolling, which improves your dog’s —and your— mental and physical health.\nHealth: When walks are calm and easy, it incentivizes pups and pet parents alike to go out strolling, which improves your dog’s —and your— mental and physical health.\nThough dogs should beleashed when out in publicin most situations for their safety, it’s important for your dog to know how to walk off leash. This will allow them to stay by your side and respond to your cues in case of an emergency or in an off-leash situation such as a yard or dog park.\nDealing with common leash-training challenges\nLeash-training isn’t always straight-forward, and a few challenges may arise.\nIf your dog pulls, avoid pulling back against them — and definitely avoid following their pull. “Allowing a dog to pull and following them with tension on the leash just reinforces pulling. The dog learns that pressure on the neck means forward movement, which is what’s motivating their behavior,”dog trainer Robert Haussmann told us.“In other words: your dog wants to move forward, and if you move them forward when they pull, they’re gonna want to keep pulling.”\nYou may want to try a new piece of equipment, such as a no-pull harness. “That’s a harness where the leash attaches in front of the dog on the chest area, which is right in front of the dog’s center of gravity,” Haussmann explains. “When the dog goes to pull forward, they can’t as easily engage the pressure on the leash and pull you.”\nYou’ll want your dog to have a strong handle on leash-trainingbeforethey encounter distractions, that way they know what is expected of them when the time comes. You can build to larger and larger distractions as you train. Use plenty of treats and positive reinforcement training to remind your pup which behavior is desirable.\nIf your pup isreactive on a leash,you should leash-train them away from stimulation and slowly incorporate more and more stimulation while using positive reinforcement training. For example, you can ask a friend to walk their dog on the other side of the street; if your pup ignores the dog or reactswithout fear or excitement,you can reward your dog with a treat. Then, you can try again with the friend’s dog coming a bit closer. Don’t rush your dog; this may be a slow process.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nIdeally, you should practice leash-training daily. Puppies may like to have several short, intense sessions throughout the day, while seniors may like a longer and calmer session.\nYour dog may react better to a different kind of collar or harness. You can use treats to train your pup to associate the collar or leash with a positive event.\nYou will want to teach your dog some common training cues such as “stay,” “sit,” and “come” to help them learn how to behave on a leash.\nReferences:\nA Better Walk: Training Dogs Not to Lunge, Growl, and Pull on a Leash.\nA Better Walk: Training Dogs Not to Lunge, Growl, and Pull on a Leash.\nBehavioural Evaluation of a Leash Tension Meter Which Measures Pull Direction and Force during Human–Dog On-Leash Walks\nBehavioural Evaluation of a Leash Tension Meter Which Measures Pull Direction and Force during Human–Dog On-Leash Walks\nBetween the Muzzle and the Leash: Dog-walking, Discipline, and the Modern City\nBetween the Muzzle and the Leash: Dog-walking, Discipline, and the Modern City\nSocial Behaviour of Domestic Dogs in a Public Off-Leash Dog Park\nSocial Behaviour of Domestic Dogs in a Public Off-Leash Dog Park\nTraining Methods of Military Dog Handlers and Their Effects on the Team's Performances\nTraining Methods of Military Dog Handlers and Their Effects on the Team's Performances\nTwo Ends of the Leash: Relations Between Personality of Shelter Volunteers and On-leash Walking Behavior With Shelter Dogs\nTwo Ends of the Leash: Relations Between Personality of Shelter Volunteers and On-leash Walking Behavior With Shelter Dogs\nWho Is Pulling the Leash?

    "page_content": "So many people are frustrated when their dogs beg at the table because this behavior detracts from an optimal dining experience. And no offense to your adorable pup, it can be unappetizing to chow down on your meal in front of a drooling dog. You may even end up eating faster, just to get through dinner so the barking or whining and puppy-dog eyes stop. Nobody needs the misery of feeling overstuffed after speed-eating.\nDogs can become frustrated, wondering if or when they will receive a special treat from you. It’s awkward to have a dog begging at the table when you have guests. Luckily, there are ways to deal with a begging dog so everybody is happy.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nIf your dog growls when you get near their food or toys, read thisright now.\nStop feeding your dog from the table.\nIt’s essential that they learn this behavior is not successful for them. If dogs come up to you at the table, and you share some food from your plate with them, do you think they will come back and try again? Of course they will. Dogs will do whatever works for them to get what they want. The simple behavior of wandering over to the table and looking up at you expectantly is definitely working for them if the result is a piece of steak or chicken.\nIn technical terms, receiving food is a positive reinforcement for the behavior of approaching the table and giving you their attention. Positive reinforcement makes the behavior more likely to occur in the future, so a dog who has benefitted from begging is a dog who will continue to beg.\nOK, let’s say you wait and wait before giving your dog any food, but finally toss them the last of your meal. Maybe you give them food only every once in a while. Unfortunately, you are reinforcing not only the begging behavior itself, but also your dog’s persistence at it. Once a dog has learned that persistence pays off, it is even more challenging to change their behavior. To put a stop to a dog’s begging, it is essential that youcompletelystop giving them food from the table, rather than do it occasionally.\nLet the games begin.\nMake sure your dog has something to do while you eat.\nIt’s helpful to offer your dog something to eat or chew on when you are eating. If mealtime predictably means a positive experience for them, they will be happy with that and less likely to try to get a bit of your meal. For this strategy to work, it’s important that your dog has something to do during your dinner and that they can count on this happening. Optionsinclude a real bone, aKong stuffed with peanut butteror other high-quality treats, a pig ear, a cow hoof, a food puzzle with great treats in it, an antler, or something similarly worthwhile from your dog’s point of view. Get in the habit of asking your dog to do something and giving the item to your dog in a spot away from the table.\nThe “something to do” can also be simply eating their own dinner, maybe out of a food puzzle so they won’t be done in 2.4 seconds. It can also be attention from someone if not everyone in the household is eating at the same time. Receiving a massage orplaying tugwill distract many dogs from what’s going on at the table. If your dog isn’t one of them, the person spending time with them while other people eat should go outside to play or to another room for petting time.\nThe first rule of thumb for you: patience.\nReframe your dog’s behavior as a “stay” in disguise.\nThink of the begging behavior, which is often so persistent, as the first step toward a perfect “stay” and gradually teach your dog to perform that staying behavior in a different place — perhaps on the other side of the room instead of right next to the dinner table, or on their dog bed. This perspective is classic dog trainer behavior, because we so frequently use a method called “shaping” to teach dogs various skills.\nShaping is teaching an individual to perform a behavior by reinforcing successive approximations of the behavior you want. With dogs for example, it’s common to shape the behavior of ringing a bell on a doorknob to be let outside. The steps that a trainer can reinforce to teach this behavior include: going into the room with the bell, going closer to the bell, looking in the direction of the bell, touching the bell, and using enough force to make the bell move even a little. Eventually, the trainer will reinforce the dog for ringing the bell.\nDog trainers are always on the lookout for behavior we can build on to get a trick (or some other desirable behavior) we want our dog to perform. A key step is recognizing that all-important first step in the series of approximations. So, a dog who lifts their paw can easily be taught to shake or wave, and a dog who likes to lie on their side can be taught to lie in the “belly-up” position because in both cases, they are already halfway there.\nAlthough begging at the table is not a desirable behavior in most people’s minds, dog trainers see it as the first step toward a “stay” in a good spot. Dogs who have the persistence and patience to remain in place at the table are performing a gorgeous “stay.” But shaping can help make it a “stay” in the spot where you (the person) prefers they stay. All that remains is to reinforce the dog for this behavior at increasing distances (starting with just a few inches away from the original location) from the table until the dog is doing it on the other side of the room or even in another room throughout the entire meal.\nWhen it gets down to it, your dog is not so much begging as they are doing a “stay” that should make any pet parent proud. You should definitely mention this toanyoneif they have the nerve to criticize the behavior of the love of your life.",

    "page_content": "There are many different reasons why your puppy might pee on your bed, and understanding the underlying reasons will determine how you treat the issue.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhy is my puppy peeing on my bed?\nNot only can puppies have accidents on your bed, but adult dogs may, too. One important thing to remember is that dogs are not spiteful and do not pee on your bed to make you mad.\nFirst, you want to think about the age of your dog. Do you have a very young puppy or an older dog? If your young puppy sleeps in your bed and is not potty trained yet, they may have accidents because they can not hold their bladder or they do not yet understand how to tell you they need to go out.\nCrating your puppy at night will help prevent accidents in your bed and help develop good potty training skills. If you insist on sleeping with your puppy (who could blame you, they are so darn cute!), be sure to take your them out if you notice they got up in the middle of the night, are moving around. or seem uncomfortable. If you are a heavy sleeper, be sure to set an alarm to take your puppy out in a timely fashion to prevent night time accidents until your puppy can hold it and is potty trained.\nIf your dog is older, they may be getting to the point where they have incontinence and can no longer hold their bowels, and investing in dog diapers may be helpful in this situation.\nTips you’ll want to pay attention to.\nWhen to seek professional help\nIs this a new behavior for your dog? This may warrant a vet visit! If your dog is exhibiting unusual urinating behaviors that you have not witnessed before, they may have a urinary tract infection or something that may need to be treated with medication. It is best to reach out to your vet and make an appointment to help treat the underlying cause.\nOnce you know your dog is healthy, you may want to think about these other reasons your dog may exhibit the behavior of peeing on your bed.\nHave you changed your sheets recently? Dogs have a sensitive sense of smell, and bed sheets are heavily covered with our scent. Your dog may be marking the bed to add their smell to the space as well. If you are unsure if it was an accident or marking behavior, observe how much urine was left.\nTypically, when a dog marks, it is much less urine than an accident. If your dog marked your bed, be sure to clean it so there is no residual smell. A residual smell may cause your dog to urinate there again. Once you have cleaned and treated the accident, it’s a good idea to cover it with baking soda for a few hours or overnight. This will help absorb any leftover odors.\nFirst step: patience.\nHow to potty train a puppy\nJust like humans, dogs can be sensitive to change. Isthere a new babyin the home? Did your schedule change because of a new job? Is there loud construction going on somewhere nearby? These are all things that can cause stress to your dog. Stress can cause a dog to exhibit behaviors that they have not exhibited in the past.  Here are some ways to help them if they are stressed out.\nHave you noticed your dog pees on the bed when only a certain member of your household is present? This may be a result of submissive urinating or excited urinating. Submissive urination is a result of fear. If you have a family member who is known for scolding a dog or puppy, they may pee in submission when around that person. If this happens, try to create positive associations with that person.\nExcited urination is quite the opposite. Is there someone in your household who comes into the room at a level of 100 percent, overly exciting your dog, using all the fun baby noises, and riling the dog up? This level of excitement may cause your puppy to urinate, and if they were on your bed when that person came in, then you may be left with a soiled bed. Have a conversation with this person, and ask them to come into the area calmly, ignoring the dog for a few minutes, until they have calmed down. Excited urination may go away as your puppy can hold their bladder more.\nAs always, if the issue persists, it is best to consult a veterinarian or dog trainer to help with the undesirable behavior.\nIf anything requires patience, it’s this.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nPuppies need to go out frequently. At night, if you are a deep sleeper, be sure to set an alarm to take your puppy out in a timely fashion to prevent night time accidents.\nIf your puppy pees when you pet them, they may be experience either submissive or excited urination. Submissive urination occurs when someone they are afraid of interacts with them, while excited urination occurs when your puppy is overstimulated, and needs to be calmed down.\nIt’s important to remember that dogs aren’t spiteful, and they aren’t purposefully peeing on your bed in order to make you mad. After you dog pees in your bed, make sure to clean the area, covering it with baking soda for a few hours or overnight in order to absorb the scent.\nReferences:\nSubmissive and Excitement Urination in Dogs",

By following a consistent and positive approach, you can teach your puppy to reliably use the designated potty area and make house training more manageable.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHow to train your puppy with a puppy pad\nFirst, choose the type of puppy pad to buy. The size of your dog will determine what kind of puppy pad you will need. Larger dogs may need a thicker or larger-sized puppy pad; you want it to be large enough for your dog to fit their body on it and thick enough to absorb their mess. You can also use newspaper if you would like.\nOnce you have picked the puppy pad you will be using, pick a location to keep the pad. You want the puppy pad to be in the location where your puppy spends most of their time; this will help with consistency. Next to the pee pad area, you will want to set up a jar with your puppy’s favorite treats, that way you can reward them for a job well done.\nAllow your puppy to get used to the puppy pad. Let them walk on it and smell it before associating it with going pee. Some young dogs may be afraid or wary of new things. By letting your puppy observe the puppy pad without any pressure, you are setting them up for success.  Never allow your puppy to play with the puppy pad; tugging or shredding it is off-limits.\nHaving a puppy is like having a toddler: You can never take your eyes off them. Always keep a close eye on your puppy especially during the beginning stages of potty training.\nHow to crate train a puppy with pads\nYou should not put pee pads in your puppy’s crate. This encourages them to go instead of waiting until you are home or awake. It’s also a choking hazard if they chew on the pee pads while unsupervised.\nIf you are crate training your puppy, you should only have them in the crate for the amount of time they can hold their pee or poop. You should take them out frequently and as soon as they wake up in the morning.\nPuppy potty training schedule by age\nStart by understanding when puppies need to go:\nPuppies typically need to go pee every few hours. It’s usually one hour for every month old they are.\nPuppies typically need to go pee every few hours. It’s usually one hour for every month old they are.\nGet in the habit of setting an alarm and using a schedule this will help you stay consistent and will allow your puppy to have more success.

Stop what you are doing, place them on the puppy pad, and wait. After, reward them for going pee.\nAs your puppy receives more positive repetitions of using the pee pad and getting a reward, they will build an understanding of what the puppy pad is for.\nIf your puppy goes over to the puppy pad and independently uses it for their bathroom, give them an extra special reward. (Example: a few extra treats, a bit more excitement, and pets when they are done.)\nWhile your puppy is learning this behavior keep the puppy pad in the same place. Only once your dog is independently using the puppy pad consistently should you move it to a new place. Start by moving it only a foot or two over at a time, and always show your puppy the new spot you moved the puppy pad.\nNever punish your puppy for an accident. If possible, interrupt your puppy when they start going somewhere they shouldn’t, and move them to the pee pad. They will begin to make the connection. When interrupting your puppy, be sure not to scare them or use anger. Try to do it as light and calm as possible.\nFollowing a consistent routine and keeping a close eye on your puppy will help you successfully pad train your puppy with ease.\nFAQs (People also ask)\nTo potty train a puppy, place them on their puppy pad shortly after they’ve finished eating, drinking, sleeping, or playing, and allow them to go pee or poop on the pad. Once they’re finished, reward them for a job well done.\nYou can start by placing your puppy on the puppy pad every 30 minutes, and increase the time as you get to know your puppy and learn how often they need to go.\nPuppy pads are a reliable tool to use while potty training your puppy.

    "page_content": "I’m embarrassed to admit that my sons were three and four-and a-half-years old before I fully processed that I had given birth to humans and not canines. I’m sure some people figured this out sooner, but the important thing is I eventually arrived at the proper understanding.\nThe truth is I had years of experience raising dogs before I had human children, so I ended up treating my babies and toddlers more like puppies. Some of the other mommies at the park seemed to think it was a bit odd, but to my dog-behaviorist mind, it was totally normal. I smooched and whoop-whooped to get their attention. When my son first started walking instead of crawling, I said he was “on his hind legs.” I used the terms “house training” and “toilet training” interchangeably.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nDespite the embarrassment of these errors — more embarrassing for friends and family than for me, truth be told — it turns out I’m not alone in realizing human parenting and dog parenting are mixed up (and similar!) in all kinds of ways.\nIt's true that the way I train my dogs and interact with them is more interchangeable with the way I teach and interact with my kids than may be true for the average parent. But I know I’m not the only one. Teach my kids to heel (but call it “stick close”) for safety when in the street? Check. Teach my kids to stay because sometimes they needed to remain in one spot for a bit for whatever reason? Check. And it goes both ways.\nTeach dogs to place a paw on a doormat so they are contained in one place just like I taught my kids to put their hand on the car in parking lots to keep them where I want them to be? Check. Offer dogs loving reassurance and a spot in the bedduring a thunderstorm,just as I offered my kids loving reassurance after a bad dream? Check.\nThis study says it’s actually less about what’sintheir DNA and more about what’sonit.\nTurns out, we raise our dogs similarly to how we were raised.\nLuckily for me, science has saved the day — allowing me to save face —  in the form of a new study that matches the feeling so many of us have: Our dogs are our kids, and we treat them as such (apparently, in my case, it’s also vice verse).\nAstudy in the journaltitled “Intergenerational Transmission of Human Parenting Styles to Human-Dog Relationships” shows that we tend to parent our dogs likewewere parented as children. It’s certainly well known that we tend to carry the lessons of parenthood from our childhood into our own parenting styles as we raise our children, so why should we expect anything different when it comes to raising our dogs?\nParenting styles with either humans or dogs are based on how parents interact with those in their care. It’s important to note here, though, that this study is not saying that your parents’ parenting style willdirectly inform yours. I personally brought the parenting style I was raised with into my own parenting choices. My parents used lots of communication, an emphasis on learning, and raised me in an environment where kids are celebrated for who they are.\nIf you read that and thought,Hey, I don’t parent my doganythinglike I was parented, that’s valid. This study is simply saying that we tend to be informed by what we know. Sometimes, that may actually mean doing things differently on purpose, and that’s cool. Regardless of how you were brought up, no one loves your pup more than you do, which means you’llalwaysdo right by them and treat them like the deserving little baby they are.\nYes, there are names for parenting styles.\nWhen it comes to parenting, there are two main types of interaction: demandingness and responsiveness. The main parenting styles are described based on the levels of those two factors. Demandingness is about control, expectations, and monitoring of behavior by parents. Responsiveness concerns emotional warmth, recognize the needs of another, and providing support.\nThe four parenting styles are best described by high or low levels of each of the two parameters: Authoritarian (high demandingness, low responsiveness), authoritative (high demandingness, high responsiveness), permissive (low demandingness, high responsiveness), and uninvolved/neglectful (low demandingness, low responsiveness).\nThese parenting styles affect how children develop. Authoritarian parenting frequently leads to children who are good at following rules but fear punishment. They may be prone to rebellion, lack social skills, and have trouble making their own decisions as adults.\nAuthoritative parenting frequently leads to children who have close relationships with their parents and are curious, confident, friendly, and good at regulating their own emotions.\nPermissive parenting tends to lead to children who feel good about themselves and have good social skills but are likely to be demanding, impulsive, and may have trouble controlling their own emotions.\nUninvolved/neglectful parents are likely to have children who have trouble maintaining social relationships, struggle to regulate their emotions, have poor coping skills, and have a tendency to overeat.\nThe effects ofpetparenting styles are not yet as well understood because not as much is known about how our behavior with our dogs influences how they develop and who they become. We do know from this study that pet parents who had permissive parents tend to adopt that style with their dogs. Does that mean their dogs are likely to develop in similar ways? It seems so.\nAnd by kids, I mean pets.\nHow do we develop parenting styles?\nResearch about pet parenting stylesshows that the way we interact with our dogs influences their behavior and their health, but we still don’t have a thorough understanding of how people develop a particular style of parenting toward their pets.\nMore research is needed to fully understand details about pet parenting styles and the way they impact our dogs, ourselves, and our relationship. Understanding how our pasts influence our futures can make our relationships with dogs better and improve the wellbeing of both pups and their parents.\nAs the authors of the recent paper write, “Additionally, by recognizing the impact of parenting styles on dog-directed behaviors, our findings offer practical implications for dog training and behavior modification programs, emphasizing the need for tailored approaches that account for individuals’ upbringing and orientations toward non-human animals. Such insights can ultimately contribute to more effective strategies for enhancing welfare and for fostering positive relationships between humans and dogs in real-world settings.”\nAll these similarities between parenting humans and parenting dogs explains why it was so natural to treat my sons like puppies, but I’m not sure how they feel about that. I do know that when they were little, they appreciated how unbothered I was about their desire to drink water out of a dog bowl, though (#parentinggoals).",

    "page_content": "Note: The names of the pet parents in this story have been changed in this article to protect their privacy.\n“Come on,” says my friend Tim, to his 11-year-old Pekinese, Brisket, as we attempt to take him for a walk. Brisket is surprisingly spry for such an old dog, but he is refusing to move at the moment. “Brisket, please!” Tim pleads. “Please! Daddy doesn’t have time for this. Ugh!”\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\n“Do you have any treats?” I ask, trying to be helpful.\n“No,” he says. “He’s just like this. He’s stubborn, that’s all. Brisket, let’s go!”\nBut is that all? Perhaps there is some issue Brisket is dealing with, something he needs, that my friend isn’t aware of. Are dogs even capable of being stubborn or is the idea that they are just another example of dog anthropomorphism? Maybe it’s not Brisket who's being stubborn but my friend. After all, he reacts the same way every time Brisket stops walking, complaining at him in various degrees of distress and refusing to invest in training or try a different approach to the problem.\nSix tips and tricks to get your dog to listen to you.\nStubbornness happens for a lot of reasons.\n“‘Stubborn’ is a label we apply to dogs when they either don’t respond as expected or are taking too long to do what we want,” saysNicole Kohanski, certified dog trainer and founder ofWiggle Butt Academyin Dallas, Texas. “Why a dog behaves this way can be due to fear, confusion, or a lack of motivation.”\nMaybe Brisket didn’t like the way we were leading him on his walk. Or maybe he smelled something nearby that he wasn’t into. Maybe he thought we were going to go one way, because that’s the way Tim usually takes him, and got confused when we went another way. Maybe he just needed to begiven some treatsto motivate himduringhis walk, instead of after his walk, as is Tim’s habit.\nWhatever the case, it’s important to realize that nothing Brisket or any dog does is ever premeditated. Dogs do not plan their behaviors in advance. They do not act out of spite or hold grudges. “Dogs act in the moment and respond to the events going on around them,” says Sally Grottini, a certified therapy and service dog trainer and dog behavior expert atJustAnswer. “This is not a behavior they arechoosing; it is always the initial instinct of the dog. And calling a dog stubborn is 100 percent the owner projecting their language and impressions on the dog.”\n“My dog [Gollum] is definitely stubborn,” says another friend of mine, Fern, when I tell her I was working on this story.\n“Well, have you trained him properly,” I ask.\n“Oh no,” she says with a laugh. “He’s trained us.”\n“Except that dog’s don’t actually train people,” I say. “Their brains don’t work like that. You just haven’t put in the time and effort to train him. Well, you have, but not consciously. If he’s developed certain behavioral habits, it’s because you’ve been reinforcing them, not because he’s willful.”\n“So, it’s my fault?” she says, defensively. “Well, now you’re making me feel bad.”\nThat was certainly not my intention, but I can’t say that I was surprised by her defensiveness. Rare is the pet parent who doesn’t get at least a little defensive when they feel that they are being told that they are not doing enough for their dog. Even still, my friends know there are other dogs who don’t behave like theirs do. They know there are dogs who are better trained. But admitting that would make them feel bad about themselves, so, instead, they push the blame onto their dogs, calling them stubborn so they don’t have to take responsibility.\nIf your friends make fun of you for treating your dog like a human being, send them this.\nLabels are masking something deeper.\n“Labeling a dog as stubborn is often an easy way to shift the blame from a problem with the relationship to a problem with the dog,” saysGeorgia Welch, National Pet Training Manager atInvisible Fence® Brand.“But it’s important for pet parents to understand that when a dog fails to comply, it is more likely a failure of communication or relationship as opposed to the dog’s obstinance. For instance, a dog might fail to comply because they think the command is optional. And they think that because their training has been inconsistent.”\nAlthough I am not with Fern or Tim all the time, I’m with them enough to know that their responses to their dogs’ behavior can change drastically depending on their mood. And while this is understandable, it does result in inconsistent enforcement of cues and a wide range of reactions to certain behaviors, which I imagine must be confusing for their dogs.\nAnother consistent obstacle to dog compliance is an excess of negative reinforcement. For instance, if every time a dog is told to “come,” it is because they are in trouble and are going to get yelled at or punished, it is unlikely that they are going to want to obey that cue. Dogs, like people, have a primal need to protect themselves.\nIf your boss only called you into their office to complain about your work, you would learn to associate “Can I see you in my office?” with feeling bad. Then, every time you hear that in the future, you’ll get a sinking feeling and not want to go to that meeting. You’re a human adult, so you will probably muster up the courage to go anyway, but dogs don’t operate like that.\nItispowerful enough, even for the tough cases, and itisthe best choice—here’s why.\nKeep things positive.\nIf you want them to obey your cues, switch to positive reinforcement. Rather than sounding angry, “put a party in your voice,” as the character Rose says in Lauren Holmes’ award-winningdog-park play,Zeus IV. When they come to you, instead of yelling at them for what they were doing before you called them over, offer them a treat for complying when you did. Punishing a dogonly teaches themthat you are someone to be feared and avoided and is always more about you releasing your anger and frustration than it is about actually training your dog to do what you need them to do.\n“Often, people assume their dogs are stubborn because they don’t understand how dogs learn,” Welch says. “People are contextual learners. If you learn to read at school, you can also read at home or at the beach. But dogs are situational learners. Learning to sit at home is different from sitting at the park, which is different from sitting at the vet office. This leads to frustrations for both dogs and humans.”\n“If you find yourself getting frustrated, take some action,” Kohanski says. “Have some fun practicing the cue with your dog and pair it with lots of fun and reinforcement, like treats, praise, and pets.”\nShe adds that you can then up the motivation. Identify your dog’s motivators — like high-reward treats, physical touch and praise, or anything else they enjoy. And reward them frequently, especially when they are doing something they love.\nHere’s Kohanski’s advice: “If your dog loves being outside, but every time you call him is to bring him indoors, he may appear stubborn about recall. So, instead, try calling him from short distances within the yard, then giving him a treat or some other form of positive reinforcement, and releasing him to play some more. This will teach him that coming to you doesn’t always mean bad things and should lead to better compliance.”\nChanging your dog’s behavior is possible, but it takes time, and you won’t succeed if you’re not willing to make some changes as well. That might sound scary, but, on the upside, the kind of positive training discussed above is exactly the thing that strengthens the bond between human and dog. If you think you and your dog are close now, just wait until you two are communicating clearly and positively. The difference will be life-changing. For both of you.",

    },
    "page_content": "If you want your lawn to be the envy of the neighborhood, your dog likely isn’t helping matters. While you don’t miss the days ofhouse training a puppy, their urine often leaves behind patchy yellow or brown spots in the grass. And unlike dog poop, you can’t just follow along behind them and clean up the mess.\nLawns and dog urine are often mortal enemies, but fortunately there are things you can do to protect your yard — and your sanity.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nWhy does dog pee kill grass?\nDog urine isrich in nitrogen, a substance which can kill grass in concentrated amounts over time. And yes, most lawn fertilizers contain nitrogen, but it’s all about moderation. A small amount of fertilizer helps keep your yard healthy; too much will kill the grass, burning it in the process.\nDogs have a tendency to pee in the same areas of a yard again and again, leading to overconcentration of nitrogen — and a lawn that looks less than stellar. If you don’t treat your grass, even with just water, it mayturn brown or yellow, or even die.\nWhat might affect urine damage to your lawn?\nYour dog might love running in your yard (or eating the grass), but the lawn may look far from healthy after regular dog urine damage. Several factors can impact how dog pee affects your yard.\nA less-processed, raw,or homemade dietcan reduce the amount of nitrogen in dog urine, limiting the damage they do to your lawn. Consider switching out your commercial kibble for wet food or using safe, hydrating fruits —like blueberries, watermelon, or cantaloupe — as treats. Make sure to consult your vet before changing your dog’s diet.\nThe more water your dog drinks, the more diluted the nitrogen in their urine will become. Plus, a healthy water intake is good for your dog’s skin, bladder, and digestive health.\nMany people believe that female dogs cause more damage to grass than male dogs, but this has more to do withhowdogs pee than their sex. Male dogs usually lift their legs and prefer to pee on things like trees and fences. Female dogs, meanwhile, tend to squat and urinate directly on the grass, causing more damage to the lawn.\nYour dog’s breed has no impact on whether their urine will harm your lawn. Some dogs may have more nitrogen in their urine, but that’s likely a result of diet or water intake, not breed.\nTips to protect your lawn from dog urine\nAs much as you love your dog, they may keep your lawn from looking green and healthy. Fortunately, there are some things you can do to prevent dog urine from killing your grass.\nMany fertilizers contain nitrogen, which is also in dog urine. The combination of both fertilizer and your dog’s pee could easily burn your lawn, so fertilize less — or not at all — in areas where your dog urinates.\nIf your grass is brown and dead in certain spots where your dog frequently urinates, consider reseeding with amore urine-resistant strain of grass, like ryegrass or fescue.\nAs with most dog-related issues, training can save the day when it comes to keeping your lawn pristine. Train your dog to eliminate in a specific area to save the rest of your yard. You can even purchase a specific grass patch for dogs to protect the rest of your yard.\nRegular wateringof the areas where your dog pees can help save dying grass in some cases. Water can dilute the urine and reduce the effects of nitrogen on your lawn.\nSpeaking of water, keeping your dog hydrated isn’t just good for their health — it’s good for your lawn, too. Encourage your pup to drink more water so the nitrogen in their urine is less concentrated, and therefore less damaging to your grass.\nDog diet supplements are available that make the nitrogen in dog urine less harmful to your grass. Always be cautious when using supplements and talk to your vet before adding anything to your dog’s diet.\nHow to get rid of dog pee spots on your lawn\nIf you want to grow grass with dogs using the yard, it’s best to prepare yourself for extra grass maintenance. When you notice dog pee spots on your lawn, make sure to water the grass where your dog has done their business for the best chance of saving your lawn.\nHere are a few other tips for getting rid of urine spots on grass:\nApply lawn treatments to the grass to remove nitrogen and salts from the soil. Be sure to use onlydog-safe treatments.\nApply lawn treatments to the grass to remove nitrogen and salts from the soil. Be sure to use onlydog-safe treatments.\nReseed any dead patches of grass.

    "page_content": "My recurring nightmare involves needing to distract, entertain, or train my dog in a challenging situation and not being able to find a single Kong anywhere. I look in the toy box, in the freezer, in my house-call bag, and in the dog supplies storage closet. Becoming alarmed, I check all the dog beds, under the couch, and in my car, but still no luck. Fully freaking out by this point, I throw my head between my knees and assume the crash position while I try to remember where I might have stashed an emergency Kong.\nThe nightmare is both absurdly melodramatic and true to my reality. Ilove Kongs. I use them in many ways for training dogs, for managing challenging situations, to make dogs’ lives better, and to prevent trouble. Imagining life without them actually is scary (plus, they come in sizes for every kind of dog —even puppies).\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThere was a time before Kongs, but thankfully it was a long time ago. The inventor of the Kong,Joe Markham, owned an auto shop, and he got a dog named Fritz to help guard it against thieves. Fritz was a good guard dog, but he was also a destructive chewer, obsessed with rocks, sticks, and even radiator hoses. It wasn’t until Fritz got hold of a rubber VW axle stop that he finally had something to chew on that interested him but didn’t destroy and didn’t hurt his teeth. That car part inspired Joe to invent the Kong — which bounces in an unpredictable fun way and can be filled with food to further entice dogs into focusing their attention on it instead of on furniture, kids’ toys, wooden kitchen utensils or anything else most of us want our dogs to leave alone.\nI am in favor of everyone having multiple Kongs to use and stuff in a variety of ways and in a variety of contexts. I will talk to any stranger anywhere, at any moment, and for any length of time with details about stuffing a Kong to make them more enticing, more interesting, last longer, and be more effective. Using a stuffed Kong can make life better, and I have my share of favorite hacks to make using Kongs easier and require less effort.\nTwo words: Endless entertainment.\nKong-stuffing 101\nOne of the easiest ways to put food in a Kong is to smear peanut butter around the inside of it. A couple of spoonfuls of this treat, so loved by almost all dogs, can keep them occupied and happy, and it’s not that hard to do. Canned dog food, cream cheese, and puréed pumpkin are also popular fillings. Most dogs immediately have an interest in a Kong stuffed with these tasty options as long as some is near the opening, so they have some success right away. To offer other good early experiences with a Kong, stuff it with a mix of kibble and treats so they easily come out with just the slightest manipulation by the dog. It’s important that they get the hang of getting food from the Kong without frustration early on.\nFor a more complex Kong-stuffing experience, think layers. I like to begin with a few really tasty treats or pieces of real meat. Then, I add layers of canned dog food or pureed pumpkin, kibble, treats or meat, and repeat. For dogs who are not yet experts with a Kong, I start with loosely packing the stuffing so they have plenty of success early on and associate the Kong with positive experiences.\nAs they get more experience, I pack it tighter so they have to work a little harder to extract the food. That makes it last longer, which is good for everybody. I still like to keep the top layer loose and easy to access so dogs get something from the Kong right away and are not tempted to give up on it, which some dogs will do if it’s too hard to get anything rewarding from it.\nAdvanced Kong-stuffing can make it last longer and be more interesting to your dog. If extracting the food poses a greater challenge, the dog gets more mental exercise, the opportunity to face something hard and succeed, and to spend more time in an engaging activity. However, a Kong should never be so hard to access that the dog becomes overly frustrated or decides that Kongs are worthless because they can’t get anything out of one. Once dogs are experienced with Kongs and have had many opportunities to succeed at getting food out of them, these harder, more challenging advanced Kong stuffing strategies can make life better for them and for you.\nOne of the best ways to make a Kong more challenging and last longer is to freeze it. Frozen food is more difficult to take out of the Kong and it takes dogs longer to do so. Frozen Kongs require something in them to hold everything together, and canned dog food does the job beautifully.\nOther options, such as stew or pumpkin, are also effective. When a dog is not yet accustomed to a frozen Kong, it’s essential to make sure they enjoy it and don’t give up because they are not getting anything. Before giving one to your dog, add a little unfrozen stuff to top it off so the dog does not get frustrated when you are first getting them used to frozen Kongs. So, fill the Kong up about an inch from the top prior to freezing, but put in some peanut butter, unfrozen wet food, or some treats before giving it to the dog.\nAn even more challenging option with a frozen Kong is to change the shape of the opening from a circle to an oval by filling the Kong, squeezing it to change the opening shape to a long thin one, and then putting a biscuit or other hard treat in the opening to make sure it holds that shape. Your dog will first have to remove the item and will then be dealing with a Kong of a different form than they are used to. Again, only advance to this level of difficulty with a dog who is used to the challenge of Kongs and will not give up entirely.\nThere are other ways to up your Kong-stuffing game. You can put a stuffed Kong inside something such as a dish towel, an old cereal box, or an oatmeal container, so your dog has to unwrap the Kong prior to accessing it. Only use items you know your dog won’t try to eat, and please supervise your dog for safety when trying something new. Be prepared to trade with them by giving them treats in exchange for the container holding the Kong if they start to eat it. Then you can unwrap it and present the plain, stuffed Kong to them.\nDon’t hit pause on your pet’s playtime – these solo activities will help 9-5 fly by for them.\nHow to use a Kong to make life better\nNewsflash: Not all dogs are at their very bestwhen visitors arrive. Whether that is true of your dog because of their boundless enthusiasm and friendliness, their fearfulness, their loud barking, or because they go into stranger danger mode and become aggressive, Kongs can help. Offering your dog a stuffed Kong filled with goodies gives them something else to pay attention to rather than the visitors, and it keeps their mouth busy. Dogs with a Kong are happier, they are not bored, and they have a purpose.\nDepending on the dog, you can give them the Kong in the main part of the house, in the yard, or in another room with the door closed. For an aggressive dog, keeping them away from guests but happy may involve receiving a Kong in a place away from the action. For friendly but exuberant dogs, being near the visitors with a Kong can often lead to being calm and able to greet visitors politely once they have finished with the Kong. The Kong gives them something to do while they get used to any visitors so they can put their best paw forward once they interact.\nKongs can keep dogs distracted and make them happy. That makes them ideal solutions to minor fears of thunderstorms, to the horror (to many dogs) that we call Halloween, to keep dogs from becoming upset when you leave (though not for true separation anxiety), dealing with dogs who bark at passersby or the mail carrier or delivery people, to keep dogs from chasing bicycles and skateboarders, and a variety of the daily challenges of life. For dogs who struggle to deal with grooming such as nail trims or being brushed, a stuffed Kong can certainly help.\nNormally, most of us keep our dogs busy and enrich their lives doing the things we enjoy together, such as walks, petting, and play sessions. A typical day might involve a hike or a run, some training, and plenty of time cuddling. Bad days can be different. Whether you have a particularly busy workday, the bad weather is ruining your plans, you are ill, or you are out for the evening, Kongs can help everybody. Your dog gets to enjoy a food puzzle and all the treats and yummy flavors inside, and you can go about your day withjust a little less guilt.\nUsing Kongs in this way — giving your dog something to do even though you can’t spend much time with them — is fine every once in a while when you are really stuck, but remember it’s still important to spend quality time with your dog, and the Kong is not a replacement for you.\nTrain your dog to stay calm when they’re on their own — instead of sad-singing“All By Myself”until you come home.\nTaking the hassle out of using Kongs\nKongs are a way of life for me, but I do understand that incorporating them into your dog’s training or daily schedule requires effort. I’ve had clients who have argued within their family about who should stuff them, who should clean them, who lost them, and who forgot to buy another one.\nI want Kongs to add to your quality of life and that of your dog — not add stress, angst, or conflict to it. Here are my favorite hacks to make using Kongs easier and more effortless, and to minimize the hassles of having one at the ready when you need one to give to your dog.\nIf you suddenly need a Kong and have to prepare it, that can feel stressful. If all you have to do is open the freezer to grab one, and maybe add a dollop of peanut butter or some wet food to top it off, that’s a way better situation, especially if time is of the essence to help your dog be at their best. Having six, eight, or more ready to go is a great idea.\nTo have Kongs available all the time, I like to stuff a whole bunch at once prior to storing them in the freezer. I have different sizes and shapes in there so I can give a dog a big treat, a little treat, a classic Kong, aGoodie Ribbon, ora Tire. Dogs often enjoy variety, so receiving Kongs of different styles adds to the enrichment they offer for your dog. I line up a dozen Kongs at a time and stuff them with a variety of ingredients before freezing them in bags or in other containers to keep them fresh until they are used.\nTo make Kong-stuffing easier, I keep a lot of ingredients in the house that can be put inside a Kong. When I am stuffing a bunch of Kongs, it’s not unusual for me to use six or seven different kinds of treats, two brands of kibble, two types of wet food, and some human food (cream cheese, chicken, steak, peanut butter) to include as well.\nThen, as I am stuffing a bunch of Kongs at once, I can make them all different, or I can do them all the same if that suits my mood. I even keep tubes ofKong Stuff’n Easy Treatin the house for those time I need to stuff a Kongright now,and it feels like too much of a bother. These spray cans of food goo are a lifesaver when you are hanging on by a thread in the sanity department and lack the energy for doing much of anything. The liver flavor is the most popular in my house, but the peanut butter one is best loved all around.\nI love Kongs (I know, my secret is out!), but stuffing them can be messy and even irksome. To avoid those problems, I put each classic Kong in a mug with the large opening facing up and stuff them in that position. This keeps them all from rolling around or spilling. Having each Kong secured in the proper position to accommodate being stuffed is a game changer.\nThere is no reason for washing Kongs to be a burden. They can go in the dishwasher (top shelf only!) which was such happy news to me when a fellow dog trainer imparted this wisdom to me. Hand-washing is good many times, but the dishwasher is great when you are really short on time. Another bit of advice is to buy aKong-cleaning brushthat makes it easier to get in and scrub the inside. It does an even better job of removing residue from the inside of a Kong than a dog’s tongue, and at less than $10, it’s a good deal.\nTo wrap this up, I wish I could write a love poem about Kongs. They improve life for both pups and their humans insomany ways. As I am not a poet, I stick firmly to composing prose when sharing why I love Kongs so much.",

Many of them probably include food and/or snuggling on the couch while you bingeParks & Recreationfor the 10th time, but there’s one thing that’s held the prime spot at the top of the list: walks.\nSo, you know that walks are the best part of your dog’s day, outside of that 4 p.m. peanut butter-Kong snack they might get, but they might not always be that fun for you. Maybe your pup pulls on the leash or is reactive with other dogs also on their daily stroll. All of these things are totally normal obstacles to come across, but there are ways to make your life easier. Stay with us.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHow can I make dog walks more enjoyable for both of us?\nGoing for a walk is the best part of your dog’s day (and hey, maybe it’s the best part of yours, too). If you’re a new pet parent, you might think dog walking is pretty simple. But the truth is, making a walk enjoyable for both you and your pup requires some foresight and training. Here are the top 10 dog-walking tips you need to know.\nAnd why you shouldn’t skip the longer routes.\n1. Select the correct leash.\nOne of the main issues new pet parents face is how to walk a dog whopulls on the leash. While training and practice are essential, the type of leash you have is also very important. Many dogs react poorly when they are tugged back, and their instinct is to pull even more. That’s where a front-clipharness comes in— it pulls your dog from the front so they won’t fight against it.\nIf your dog does the opposite and pancakes to the ground, turns on a dime, or is otherwise spooked easily (many newly rescue dogs are considered fight risks on walks, especially in urban environments with lots of scary stimuli, from skateboards to strollers.Martingale collarsare designed to prevent an escape-artist dog from backing or slipping out of a flat collar or wiggling out of a harness (it happens more often than you think).\n“Because this style of collar gets tighter when pulled, they are known for preventing a dog from slipping out, which is why they are a favorite of rescues. A martingale collar has an extra loop that you clip a leash into so that when pulled, it cinches the rest of the collar down evenly around the dog’s neck. The limited cinch is gentler than a ‘choke’ collar,” explains Anne Christian, the founder ofDog + Bone, who make customized martingale collars.\nExperts pick the best harnesses for every kind of dog—from flat-faced breeds to tiny teacups to escape artists.\n2. Start slow with puppies.\nWhen it comes to puppy walking, many people don’t realize that puppies can’t be walked very far, no matter their size. Twenty minutes is the maximum they should be out for at first. You can gradually build up to longer walks as your pup gets older and more mature.\n3. Train your dog on walks.\nWalks are a great time to start training your dog on basic good behavior. Dog-walking training is a good way for your pup to meet new people, interact with other dogs, and get used to the outside world. You will need to be firm with them at the start using positive reinforcement, but they’ll soon get the hang of it. Everyone loves a puppy, but make sure you’re careful around children since you won’t know how your pup will react at first.\nDon’t let your new dogwalk you.\n4. Stick to a routine.\nWhile your dog gets used to walking with you, it’s a good idea to stick to a routine. This means walking them at the same time each day and to the same places. This will help them  learn how they are expected to behave and will help them behave better when you introduce them to new walking areas. It also helps dogs stay calm when they know where they are going.\n5. Bring treats.\nTeaching your dog how to behave in public isn’t always the easiest thing, but it can be done. Knowing how and when to reward your pup is essential. A dog will listen to you when you havetreats in your hand, so make sure that you only give them out when they’ve done something right, and not to get them to calm down. If you give your dog a treat every time they demand one, you’ll only reinforce the behavior that you don’t want.\nDog behaviorist Karen B. London’s 7 tips to help get your parked pet moving.\n6. Know how much exercise your dog needs.\nThe type of dog you have will determine howlong you need to walkthem for and what type of exercise they need, so be sure to do your research. Some breeds and mixes will be perfectly happy with a couple of small walks every day, while others will need to go somewhere they can run around for a long time to really let out their energy.\n7. Be prepared.\nThere are three items (besides a leash) that you should never leave home without. The first one is, of course,poop bags. Always clean up after your dog. Not only is it common courtesy, but if you don’t, you could be faced with a hefty fine. You should also have a bottle of water with you. Even when the weather isn’t warm, your dog can get dehydrated quickly. Finally, a toy that you can throw for them means that they’ll be able to run around for a bit and enjoy themself.\nSure, microchips can feel a little1984. But if your pup has a chip, they’re four times more likely to make it home if they get lost.\n8. Hire a dog walker.\nIn an ideal world, you’d always walk your dog yourself — but unfortunately, this simply isn't possible. Most dogs need regular exercise and long walks, and if you can’t provide them, it’s best to look into hiring a professional dog walking company. Manydog walkerscan also help you with dog training and have strict dog-walking guidelines that they follow so you know your dog is in safe hands wherever they go.\n9. Consider the weather.\nMaking sure you’re aware of your surroundings and potential weather dangers is one dog-walking tip that is often overlooked. Both theheatand thecoldcan really affect your dog, with some breeds more susceptible to weather changes than others. Having a jacket for your dog in the cold and watching their paws on the hot sidewalk in the sun is a must. Consider gettingpet insurance, just in case anything does ever happen when you’re out walking.\n10. Get a microchip for Your dog.\nOne of the most important dog-walking tips is to have yourdog microchipped. That way, you’ll be able to find them if they ever wander off or get lost. Having a collar with their name and your number on it is also a good idea.\nThere’s such a thing as too much of a good thing.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nIdeally, you should walk your dog every day for about an hour. Puppies should not be out for longer than about twenty minutes.\nBe sure to use a front-clip harness or martingale collar andleash train your pup. Always bring water and look out for signs ofheatstrokeandoverexertion.\nMaking sure you’re aware of your surroundings and potential weather dangers is one dog-walking tip that is often overlooked. Keep an eye on your dog for signs of discomfort and heat exhaustion.\nThere are three items (besides a leash) that you should never leave home without: poop bags, a bottle of water, and a toy.\nReferences:\nA Cross-Sectional Study of Factors Associated With Regular Dog Walking and Intention to Walk the Dog\nA Cross-Sectional Study of Factors Associated With Regular Dog Walking and Intention to Walk the Dog\n10 Dog Walking Tips Everyone Should Know\n10 Dog Walking Tips Everyone Should Know\nDog Walking Tips Everyone Should Know\nDog Walking Tips Everyone Should Know\n10 Dog Walking Tips to Enjoy a Stroll With Your Furry Friend\n10 Dog Walking Tips to Enjoy a Stroll With Your Furry Friend",

      "title": "9 Myths About Your Puppy—Busted By a Behaviorist",
      "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/puppy-myth-busting"
    },
    "page_content": "Dispelling myths about raising and training puppies helps change patterns of behavior that are detrimental to the goal of raising happy, healthy, well-behaved, and well-adjusted puppies. That in turn can make it easier for puppies to adapt to their new home in a way that sets up people and dogs alike for a full dog’s lifetime of love and happy relationships. Let’s debunk nine common myths so you and your puppy can start your life together on the right paw (sorry, had to).\nMyth 1: Puppies can’t be around other dogs at all until they are fully vaccinated.\nYes, they can, and they should. If you wait until a puppy isfully vaccinatedto introduce them to other dogs, it will be too late for them to develop the normal canine social skills and the comfort of being around other dogs that naturally occur when they meet other dogs early on.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nPuppies need to meet other dogs in the range of eight to 14 weeks old and then keep meeting new ones regularly as they are developing into adults. However, most puppies aren’tfully vaccinateduntil they are 16 to 18 weeks old, so if you wait until then, your puppy will be beyond the window when exposure to other dogs does the most good for their development.\nMyth 2: If you comfort them, you’ll reinforce their fear.\nNo, you won’t. Behavior can be reinforced, not emotions. Giving solace to a fearful puppy is both kind and helpful. When they are afraid, whether it’s because of thunder, a charging cat, the giant box in the entryway, or anything else in their world, they need you. Your reassurance and loving manner help them feel more secure and more confident.\nYou offer them feelings of safety when you comfort them. To deprive them of this because of the concern that you might make them more fearful is an idea without merit, so thankfully you can follow the natural impulse to sooth them.\nMyth 3: It’s good to take your puppy running for exercise.\nNo, it’s not. Many dogs grow up to begreat running partners, but puppies should not go running with us. Sustained running is not good for young dogs, especially if they are running on concrete, asphalt, or other hard surfaces. That can be damaging to feet, joints, and other parts of the body.\nPuppies can run around and play, but that is different than going running for an extended time. The age at which dogs can start to run varies based on many factors, including the size of the dog and type of the dog. A common recommendation is not to run with your dog until they are at least nine months to a year old, but it’s essential to consult with your veterinarian for advice about your particular dog.\nIt’s the saddest sound in the world.\nMyth 4: Puppies who live with other dogs know how to get along with dogs and don’t need play dates or other opportunities to meet dogs.\nYes, they do. Even though theother household dogsare a part of teaching a puppy to bedog- social, it’s not sufficient just to know the other dogs they live with.\nDogs who only know the few dogs in their family are likely to be comfortable with those dogs only and not with other dogs. In order to be comfortable with a variety of dogs they knowanddon’t know, they need multiple experiences meeting unfamiliar dogs. That way they learn to be comfortable with dogs in general and not just with a few dogs specifically.\nMyth 5: Puppies need walks starting when you bring them home.\nNo, they don’t. Puppies need exercise, mental stimulation, and attention, which are commonly available on walks, but walks are not the only way to provide them. Many puppies feel overwhelmed by walks and do better with time outside in the yard, play sessions, andfood puzzlesto accomplish the same things that walks do.\nIf your puppy seems to enjoy walks, that’s great and you should absolutely walk them. However, if your puppy needs a little time to adjust before starting a walking routine, it’s also totally fine to ease into walks by using a leash and collar in the house or in the yard or by meandering just one or two houses down the block and then returning home.\nMyth 6: Puppies must meet hundreds of people in the first two months you have them.\nSocialization is the process ofexposing a puppyto a variety of new experiences during the critical period of their lives from three to 14 weeks. The high quality of these experiences is important in a way that high quantity isn’t. What is essential is that your puppy has positive experiences with the people they meet.\nThat means you want people to be calm with them and to offer them treats, play, or petting if they enjoy that physical contact. A handful of experiences that are positive and enjoyable for the puppy are far better for socialization purposes than a large number that the puppy finds overwhelming, scary, confusing, or otherwise unpleasant.\nMyth 7: Puppies should go to the dog park for socialization.\nNo, they shouldn’t. Yes, dogs need to meet other dogs during their socialization period in order to be comfortable around other dogs, including when they are meeting new ones, for the rest of their lives. But thedog park is not the placeto do this. Puppies need to meet dogs one at a time, or in small groups, and these dogs they meet should be carefully chosen.\nA puppy should meet other puppies and nice adult dogs with good social skills so the puppies have a positive experience and learn proper dog social skills. At the dog park, they are likely to become overwhelmed by too many dogs, high arousal dogs, rude dogs, or even aggressive dogs. Taking a puppy to the dog park is far more likely to teach young dogs that other dogs are to be feared than that other dogs make good friends. Also, there is too high a risk of contact with germs at the dog park that can cause serious diseases in puppies.\nHere’s your guide to how treats can help as your new pup is learning all the things.\nMyth 8: Crate training is mean.\nNo, it’s not. Teaching your puppy to be comfortable in a crate is kind. Manydogs love their cratesand feel comfortable in them no matter where they are. A dog who hasbeen crate trainedwill likely feel more comfortable and relaxed when they travel, go to someone else’s house, or must be at the vet or the groomer for longer than just a brief visit. Otherwise, these experiences can be more stressful. Crates should not be used for extended periods of time and certainly not as punishment.\nMyth 9: Puppies and collar/leashes are a natural combo.\nNo, they aren’t, though Isowish they were. Most dogs must betaught to accept collarsand leashes or they will scratch at them or try to shake them off and get away from them. If you start when a puppy is young — two months old or so — by putting a collar on and then later attaching a leash to it, they have an easier time accepting them than if you start when they are significantly older.\nTo make it easier and more comfortable for them to get used to a leash, start withlightweight versionsof both (even possibly acat leashfor small or sensitive pups!) and make sure the collar is not so tight it causes discomfort but not so loose it moves a lot or can be slipped out of. Associate the collar and leash with treats and fun. Always do something they like, such as offer them treats or go outside to walk or play after you put on the collar and leash.\nReferences:\nYou Can’t Reinforce Fear; Dogs and Thunderstorms",

    "page_content": "We’ve all heard the stereotypes like“Yorkies are yappy,” “Pit Bulls are aggressive,”orChihuahuas love tacos. While most pet parents of these breeds agree the labels are far off-base, they persist nonetheless. However, a recent study is hoping to curb some of that thinking. Last week, the science journalSciencepublished findingsthat upend many of these behavioral misnomers.\nThe community science projectDarwin’s Arkwas responsible for much of the data. Researchers examined a compilation of owner surveys, providing info on over 18,000 dogs, as well as sequencing the genomes of nearly 2,200 of them.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\n“Dogs are a natural system for investigating the genetics of complex traits. Millions of pet dogs live in human homes, sharing our environment, and receive sophisticated medical care,” reads the study, which was co-authored by 25 scientists. “Behavioral disorders are treated with human psychiatric drugs, achieving similar response rates, and genetic studies suggest shared etiology with some human psychiatric conditions.”\nThese sweet pups need advocates,this National Pit Bull Awareness Month, and always.\nBreed reallydoesn’tinform behavior.\nUltimately, the team found that as little as nine percent of a dog’s behavior can be attributed to their breed. That’sroughly the same ratioof real tuna in a Subway “tuna” sandwich. (For those unaware of its meaty scandal or lucky enough to have avoided the chain altogether, less than one-tenth is not substantial enough to make a difference.)\nSo, what factors impact a dog’s behavior on a more tangible level? “Early socialization, exposure to novelty, training from the get-go,” saysRobert Haussmann,certified dog trainer, founder ofDogboy NYC, andour Collectivemember. “True, clear, and fair leadership — not punishment or alpha dogging — to give a dog clear information about the world that it lives in. That all plays a big role.”\nIt’s important to note that the study was primarily focused on behavior in relation to a dog’s reactions to something they find new or strange — essentially, their level of aggression, a dangerous categorization that can result in misjudged breeds becoming less likely to be adopted, as evidenced by manyPit Bull-type dogs’public image and struggle to find homes. Unfortunately, harmful ideas have a tendency to reinforce themselves and snowball.\n“Pitties in a lot of cities — and I can speak for New York — make up a ton of dogs in our shelter system,” Haussmann explains. “What’s that dog’s early life and socialization? A huge percentage of these dogs could be and should be loving family members.” Of course, according to the study, Pit Bulls did prove to be one of the more human sociable pups — news to no one who’s ever met one. Haussmann also points toward irresponsible breeding as a catalyst for this lingering issue, something Darwin’s Ark notes.\nModern breeds have a history of about 160 years, whereas their evolutionary origin may date back over 10,000 years. And only in the last century and a half have they been primarily bred for appearance rather than functional roles, such as hunting, guarding, and herding. The dedication in some circles to purebred breeding has only escalated this deviation, but even then behavior is not predetermined — as 49 percent of the dogs cataloged in the survey were purebred.\nNow, this might sound a bit contradictory given the last 500ish words, but the data did confirm that a dog’s heritage can play a role in their behavior. The researchers found that around 25 percent of behavioral traits are inherited and according to our expert, that tracks. “That’s how genetics, in general, work. And I think specifically in the world of dogs with their flexible genome, that’s even more inclined,” Haussmann says.\nActress and comedian Rebecca Corry wants to heal society’s messed up relationship with Pit Bulls—starting with this movie.\nDNA testing can tell us a lot.\nWhen you think about all the benefits of testing a dog’s DNA, we know that can be a positive resource. Certain breeds may be more susceptible to allergens or diseases and with that information, we can help prevent them or prepare the best treatment early on.\nHowever, there is one last significant factor to ponder regarding this study. Similar to how you react when hearing your aunt boast about some politician secretly being a lizard person, we have to consider the source. Given most of the information the researchers were working off of is based on survey questions and pet owner testimonials, the data may not be entirely reliable.\nWith that, how should we feel about these findings? According to Haussmann, “What I’d take away from this study reinforced my own observations, which is any dog, regardless of breed, can be fearful, aggressive, anxious, overzealous, stubborn…whatever behavior you’re seeing, it could be a problem with any dog, any breed, any age, any size.” In other words, just as you wouldn’t judge all tuna based on the crap Subway labels as such — don’t judge all dogs of a breed based on the actions of one.",

Having rich and varied social experiences in their puppyhood improves a pup’s odds of growing into a balanced, confident adult dog — and who doesn’t want that for their pup?\nSure, an introverted pup who only likes you is adorable in theory — but the reality of afearful,bite-y dogis way less cute.

Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nSocialization as a concept is often misunderstood, and that confusion gets in the way of starting puppies off right. Here’s what you need to know to properly socialize your new puppy.\nWhat is puppy socialization, and why is it important?\nPuppy socialization isn't just about introducing your pup to other dogs — it's about introducing them to new people, stimuli, animals, and environments. Getting your pup comfortable with the world at a young age is crucial because it will make it easier for them to interact with others in the future.\nWhen should I start socializing my puppy?\nThe most effective puppy socialization period takes place between weeks three and 12 of the puppy’s life; then, it slams shut. Given that the lastcombination vaccine(against distemper, hepatitis,parvovirus, parainfluenza, and coronavirus) is usually administered when a puppy is 16 weeks old, this timeline raises questions on when a puppy can safely be around other dogs.\nSome veterinarians, shelters, and breeders advise new pet parents to wait until after a puppy has had their final set of vaccinations to allow them to interact with others. Unfortunately, by that time, the socialization period has ended, precluding the pup’s best shot at acquiring lifelong dog-on-dog social skills. So, what’s a pet parent to do? Let’s look at the research.\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nAstudy conducted bythe University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine looked at the risks to partially vaccinated puppies ofcontracting parvoat indoor puppy socialization sessions (socials). The results were reassuring.\nIt seems that puppies who have had only their first set of shots are at no greater risk of being infected withparvovirusthan those not attending socials. During the study, it was reported that none of the 15 puppies who contracted parvovirus had attended puppy socials, and that none of the puppies who attendedpuppy classescontracted parvovirus.\nThis dovetails perfectly with the standard of caresuggestedby the American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior (AVSAB), which unequivocally recommends pet parents should begin socialization classes for puppies as early as seven to eight weeks of age, and seven days after the first set of vaccines. The American Veterinary Medical Association, the ASCPA, and other dog health and behavior experts agree.\nIf it’s time for a round of shots (no, not that kind), follow this guide.\nAs the ASVAB statement reads: “The primary and most important time for puppy socialization is the first three months of life. During this time, puppies should be exposed to as many new people, animals, stimuli, and environments as can be achieved safely and without causing over-stimulation manifested as excessive fear, withdrawal, or avoidance behavior.”\nIt is important to note that structured puppy socials run by a variety of training and daycare facilities and other pet-related businesses take place indoors on non-porous surfaces, and “accidents” are cleaned up immediately with an antimicrobial solution. Porous surfaces, such as dirt, sand, and, in particular, those found atdog parks, must be avoided until full vaccination.\nPeople unaware of puppy socials are more likely to take puppies to places they should not be until they’re fully vaccinated, which includes dog parks,beaches, and other settings with porous surfaces likely to harbor parvovirus-infected feces.\nHere are the types of worms your pup could get, how you know they have them in the first place, and how to get rid of them for good.\nUnderstanding How Puppies Develop\nWhy is the window of opportunity so small? At the risk of stating the obvious, puppies develop much faster than humans. For example, puppies walk beautifully at three weeks, but it takes human babies about a year to reach that milestone. This acceleration affects cognitive function in dogs, which develops rapidly during the short socialization period; it’s during this time that a puppy’s framework for future social functioning evolves. A strong foundation built from a rich set of early experiences gives the puppy more context in which to evaluate and react to future stimuli in the environment, including people and other dogs.\nThe most importantsocialization periodof puppies — the time during which they readily incorporate new experiences into the developing worldviews that directly affect lifelong behavior — lasts from weeks three to 12. That’s it. Let’s break it down:\nPuppies go through primary socialization during the first three to seven weeks with the puppy’slittermates, where they learn the ins and outs of being a dog — such asbite inhibition— from their mother and siblings. How they interact with humans during this period is important, too. Puppies who regularly interact and are handled during the first seven weeks will grow to be more stable,handle stress better, be more curious, and learn faster than other pups.\nHow to teach your pup to play nice.\nBecause most puppies (but not all) remain with their mother and littermates for seven weeks, this means that new pet parents have just four weeks to make sure their puppy has ample opportunities to learn that there are many sorts of people and types of dogs in this world.\nWeeks eight through 12 are called the “second socialization period.” During those 28 days, a puppy’s brain is like a sponge, supple and ready to absorb and incorporate new experiences. This is, without question, the most profoundly important period in a dog’s life. Their brain is wired to absorb new experiences far more rapidly than during any subsequent period, and they learn not only to accept being around people and other dogs, but also to enjoy and seek out these experiences.\nWhile not a perfect analogy, a puppy’s capacity to learn social skills is similar to a young child’s capacity to learn languages. Studies have shown that children younger than seven easily pick up new languages because their brains are capable of readily incorporating the sounds, words, grammar, and structure of multiple languages.\nWhat to expect when your perfect puppy hits that unruly stage.\nLike the puppy socialization period that ends at 12 weeks, this window closes for children around seven, after which language acquisition becomes far more difficult. A six-year-old child who spends a year in a Mandarin immersion class will come out fluent in the language. If an adult were to attend the same class, they would likely still be struggling with the basics. Their Mandarin would improve over time as they became more familiar and comfortable with the language, but they would never be as fluent as a child introduced at an early age. Likewise, dogs without the advantage of a rich socialization period can learn to thrive in social situations, but it takes a great deal more time and effort and has a lower chance of success.\nPuppy socials do not guarantee that a dog won’t develop fear or aggression later in life;genetics, in-utero experiences, early nutrition, and the first weeks with the mother and siblings also play key roles.\nWhat are some safe ways to socialize my puppy?\nIt goes without saying that your puppy needs to be socialized to the environment in which they will be living. Over 80 percent of Americans live in urban areas, surrounded by many other people and dogs, which means the best way to socialize your puppy is by exposing them to an array of experiences.\nReady for your puppy socialization checklist? Here's how to properly socialize a puppy:\nSit with your puppy outside and watch as friends or neighbors do their daily activities.\nSit with your puppy outside and watch as friends or neighbors do their daily activities.\nHave friends wear different hats, sunglasses, and odd clothing, allowing your puppy to practice interactions.\nHave friends wear different hats, sunglasses, and odd clothing, allowing your puppy to practice interactions.\nExpose your puppy to things such as shovels, rakes, skateboards, bikes, and things with different textures and sounds, etc.\nExpose your puppy to things such as shovels, rakes, skateboards, bikes, and things with different textures and sounds, etc.\nTake your puppy for car rides.\nTake your puppy for car rides.\nGo to a grocery store and sit in the parking lot,giving treats as your puppy watches people walk around outside.\nGo to a grocery store and sit in the parking lot,giving treats as your puppy watches people walk around outside.\nLet your puppy walk over, under, and around various obstacles with varied textures.\nLet your puppy walk over, under, and around various obstacles with varied textures.\nNew kid on the block? Follow this trainer’s tips before letting your pet run wild.\nShould I take my puppy to socialization class?\nAttending puppy socialization classes allows puppies to learn and practice social skills. They’ll gain the skills needed to communicate, interact, play and read thebody languageof other dogs.\nFor some puppies, the sights and sounds at their first puppy socialization class may be  overwhelming. Sometimes, a timid puppy will hang back for the first few events and then become a social butterfly. At their first puppy social, they may hang out under your chair and observe the other puppies playing. You do not need to coddle, overprotect, or force them to engage. By the second puppy socialization class, they may venture out, playing for a few minutes, then retreating to their safe place under your chair. By the third social, they may be actively seeking out playmates and practicing adult communication behaviors, which is the ultimate goal of these events.\nA word of caution here: if you have a shy andfearfulpuppy andonlytake them to the first puppy socialization class (during which they sit overwhelmed and frightened under the chair), it almost certainly will backfire. They may only learn that being around other dogs is an unpleasant experience to be avoided.\nIf they’re following you around like your shadow, there’s a reason for that.\nIn addition to socials, a widely accepted goal is for a puppy to “meet” 100 people during these same four weeks: babies, children, elderly folks, men and women of all races, sizes and shapes, dressed in all sorts of clothing and carrying all kinds of implements — umbrellas, canes, plastic bags, etc. Wondering how to introduce your puppy to strangers? Do it at your dog's own pace, in a way that isn’t overwhelming. It's important that they get ample rest and are not overly fearful.\nWhile puppy socials and people-meet-and-greets are important, they must be positive experiences, not too overwhelming, and not too scary. As your pup’s parent, you need to shield them from overtly frightening situations (being pursued by an unruly, much larger puppy, for instance), but you must also allow them to jump into the rollicking puppy mayhem at their own pace.\nIf a dog has negative experiences with something (like other people or dogs) early on, they may learn not to be comfortable and social with people or other dogs but, instead, be nervous or afraid around them. For example, bringing a puppy to a large crowded place the day after being adopted is potentially damaging and not recommended. It’s much better to meet people one or two at a time and have those people provide treats, toys, and gentle touching in a calm setting. Exposure to people and other dogs that result in positive experiences for the puppy provides proper socialization. Being frightened and overwhelmed does not.\nThere’s a lot more to it than sniffing each other’s butts.\nFAQs (People Also Ask):\nChances are, your puppy is scared and overwhelmed by the situation. Try again with only one dog or human at a time, and use treats for positive reinforcement.\nYes, it's a good idea to take your puppy wherever you go so they can get used to different situations and stimuli. Just avoid the dog park until your pup is fully vaccinated.\nReferences\nSocializing a Puppy Now\nSocializing a Puppy Now\nSocializing Your New Puppy\nSocializing Your New Puppy\nPuppy Socialization and Early Exposure\nPuppy Socialization and Early Exposure\nLiterature Review on the Welfare Implications of Socialization of Puppies & Kittens\nLiterature Review on the Welfare Implications of Socialization of Puppies & Kittens",

Maybe you envision idyllic walks in the park with everyone in tow, or cozy movie nights with a pile of fur at your feet (who secretly judges your taste in rom-coms). But let’s be real: Family life is messy, unpredictable, and often involves questionable levels of noise. The last thing you need is a canine who only adds to the stress or doesn’t match your family’s vibe.\nFear not, future pack leader. This guide will help you navigate thedog breedsbest suited for the family circus. After all, some pups are born to fetch Frisbees and snuggle with toddlers, while others would prefer a solo spa day.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nFrom Golden Retrievers to Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, we’re breaking down the best family dog breeds to complete your pack. You can also consider these breeds in mixes when you’re looking at adopting a rescue pup. (And remember: You can findpurebred dogsat rescues these days and should always consider rescuing.)\nBreeds with those squished-in faces are charming — but their health issues are not.\nWhat to look for in a family dog\nTemperament is one of the most important characteristics to consider in a dog breed when you’re welcoming one into your family. Sure, that tiny Chihuahua snoozing on the couch is adorable, but imagine explaining to your tearful toddler for the tenth time that Fido isn’t actually a living teddy bear (spoiler alert: he might not appreciate being hugged like one).\nFamily dogs are the ultimate chill companions, able to handle the whirlwind of emotions and energy that comes with having little humans around. They’re the ones who don’t flinch at the high-pitched shriek of a toy car alarm and happily join in on a game of fetch in the living room, even if it means dodging the occasional rogue Lego brick.\nBasically, they’re the furry equivalent of a comfy pair of sweatpants — adaptable, endlessly patient, and down for whatever adventure (or Netflix marathon) your family throws their way.\nIntelligent andtrainable dogsare eager to please and quick to learn the house rules. They’ll master basic commands in no time, which means less time spent wrestling with a leash and more time enjoying those epic family walks in the park.\nPlus, a smart pup can adapt to your ever-changing family dynamic. Whether it’s a new baby or a house full of rambunctious relatives, they’ll roll with the punches with a smile on their furry face.\nFinding a dog whose energy level matches your family’s is key. An active Golden Retriever will happily join you on hikes and bike rides, while a playful Beagle might be content with a good game of fetch in the backyard. Remember, a tired pup is a well-behaved pup, so choose your canine companion wisely. They’re not just a new family member, they’re your built-in adventure buddy — or cuddle buddy, depending on the day.\nWhen it comes to family dogs, while you don’t necessarily need a dog who’s built like a tank, one resembling a tiny porcelain doll likely won’t be able to withstand the bumps, tumbles, and enthusiastic cuddles that come with young children.\nLook for breeds known for their gentleness and low aggression — think of them as the Mary Poppins of the dog world, practically perfect in every way. Now, that doesn’t mean you can throw caution to the wind. Tiny humans are unpredictable, and even the most patient pup can get overwhelmed. Extra supervision is key, especially with very young children. The golden rule? Never leave even the gentlest dog unattended with a small kid.\nThe dogs — 20 of them puppies — will be available for adoption in the coming weeks.\nTop picks for best family dog breeds\nPit Bull is not a purebred bred but rather abreed type. These types of dogs, known for their muscular builds, blocky heads, and often shorter snouts, are great with kids. Althoughharmful media-perpetuated stereotypeswould have people believe the opposite, Pit Bull-type dogs are gentle, kind, and patient. They havelong been family dogsand (plus!) are in need of rescuing at shelters across the U.S.\nPicture this: Sunshine personified, bounding through the park with your little ones in tow, fur the color of a perfectly toasted marshmallow. That’s the magic of a Golden Retriever. These playful pups are basically the MVPs of the family dog world.\nForget needing a suit of armor — a Golden Retriever’s superpower is their endless patience and goofball energy. They’re down for a game of fetch in the living room, happy to snuggle on the couch for movie night, and built sturdy enough to handle passionate cuddles. They’re guaranteed to bring smiles (and maybe a little slobber) to every member of the family.\nThese enthusiastic retrievers are living proof that happiness comes with a wagging tail and a never-ending capacity for belly rubs. Unlike that delicate crystal vase you inherited, Labs are built tough enough to withstand the playful chaos of family life. They’re goofy, smart, and eager to please, making training a breeze. Basically, a Lab is your family’s personal cheerleader, always up for an adventure, big or small.\nThose looking for a canine companion with an air of royalty can’t go wrong with a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. These little charmers are the perfect lapdog for your mini-monarch, offering endless cuddles and playtime without the boundless energy of a larger breed. While they might not be built for tackling toddlers, Cavaliers are known for their gentle nature and patience, making them a great choice for families with older children.\nBloodhound nose, cuddle-puddle enthusiast: that’s the Beagle in a nutshell. These happy-go-lucky pups bring a joyful energy — and maybe a few enthusiastic howls — to your family fold. Forget needing a jogging buddy who can keep pace with a marathon runner; Beagles are more than content with agood sniffariaround the backyard or a playful romp in the park.\nWhile their independent streak might require a little extra patience during training, a Beagle’s love for their humans is undeniable. Just be prepared for a side effect of endless tail wags, a nose perpetually stuck to the ground, and enough hound dog charm to melt even the grumpiest family member’s heart.\nThese fluffy bundles of joy are like living teddy bears, bringing a touch of elegance to your family life. Unlike a high-strung pup who needs constant exercise, a Bichon Frisé  is perfectly content with some playtime and a snuggle session on the couch. Theirhypoallergenic coatmakes them a great choice for people with allergies — just be prepared for the responsibility ofregular groomingto keep their fluffy coat looking its best.\nThe Havanese is a cuddle champion with a heart of gold, making them one of the best small dog breeds for families. Don’t be fooled by their small size, these pups are playful and energetic, keeping up with your kids for a game of fetch or a backyard adventure. They also have a hypoallergenic coat in case you have family members with allergies.\nLooking for a canine companion who’s equal parts elegance and goofball? Look no further than the English Setter. These graceful athletes areall about the zoomies, making them the perfect playmate for active families. While their boundless energy might require an outlet, their gentle nature and eagerness to please make training easy. Keep in mind that they are on the larger side, so you’ll want to be mindful of their energy around small children.\nCollies are the ultimate family dogs, known for their intelligence, loyalty, and protective nature. These majestic pups are like having your own personal nanny, always happy to keep an eye on your little ones. They’re eager to please and quick to learn, making them a great fit for families looking for a trainable companion.\nDon’t let their fancy haircuts fool you; these dogs are all about fun and family. Poodles come in three sizes (standard, miniature, and toy) so you can pick the perfect one for your crew. With their hypoallergenic coat, they’re another great choice if you have family members with allergies.\nSure, they might require regular grooming to maintain their signature poof, but think of it as a bonding experience (and who knows, maybe you'll pick up some styling tips for yourself along the way).\nAny of these breeds are great for city living and available at shelters and rescues.\nEvaluate your unique needs\nBefore you dive headfirst into the world of adorable puppy pictures, it’s important to take a moment to consider your own family’s needs. Sure, a fluffy Saint Bernard might look cuddly, but is your living room prepared for a personal avalanche of fur every shedding season?\nThis isn’t just about picking the cutest dog — it’s about finding the perfect companion whocomplements your lifestyle. Think about your activity level. Are you weekend warriors or couch potatoes? Apartment dwellers might need a pup withlower exercise requirementsthan a family with a sprawling backyard. And don’t forget to factor in any allergies or special needs within the family. Some breeds require more grooming than others, and some have specific needs that might not mesh well with your family dynamic.\nUltimately, choosing a family dog is a big decision. By taking the time to evaluate your priorities, you’ll ensure you find a pack member who brings joy, laughter, and the perfect amount of slobbery kisses to your family for years to come.\nSpoiler: It’s not about the breed. But these pupsarepretty brainy.\nFAQs (people also ask):\nSeveral family-friendly breeds are known for minimal shedding, including Poodles (standard, miniature, and toy), Bichon Frisé, Havanese, and even the playful Beagle (though their short fur might still require regular brushing). Remember, even hypoallergenic breeds may require regular grooming to maintain their coats.\nWhile size doesn’t always dictate temperament, some smaller breeds are well-suited for families. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Bichon Frisés, and Havanese offer playful personalities and gentle natures ideal for children. If you crave a cuddly companion who won’t shed much, these pups might be your perfect match. Remember, even smaller breeds have exercise needs, so consider your family's activity level when choosing your dog.\nGolden Retrievers and Labrador Retrievers are classic choices formedium-sized family dogs, with their playful spirit, endless patience, and trainability. If activity is your family's middle name, consider an English Setter. Their boundless energy is a perfect match for energetic families. Collies, with their intelligence and loyalty, are practically nannies-in-training, while Beagles bring a happy-go-lucky charm and a manageable size to your family adventures.\nTemperament can vary within breeds, and training plays a huge role. However, some breeds are generally known for their eagerness to please and trainability, making them shine in well-managed households.\nGolden Retrievers and Labrador Retrievers are superstars, while Poodles impress with their intelligence. For a smaller option, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are gentle and affectionate. Remember, any breed (or mix) can be a great family dog with the right training and love.\nReferences:\nDogs Supporting Human Health and Well-Being: A Biopsychosocial Approach\nDogs Supporting Human Health and Well-Being: A Biopsychosocial Approach\nHighly Heritable and Functionally Relevant Breed Differences in Dog Behaviour\nHighly Heritable and Functionally Relevant Breed Differences in Dog Behaviour\nMood-Boosting Power of Dogs\nMood-Boosting Power of Dogs\nPosition Statement on Pit-Bulls\nPosition Statement on Pit-Bulls",

    "page_content": "As someone who works remotely, I have a serious at-home office setup. It includes a large desk holding multiple monitors with the type of elaborately comfy chair previously reserved for Twitch streamers. The downside to these long-sought-after luxuries is that I rarely use them because my dog can’t get close enough to me when I do. If I don’t sit on the couch, bed, or somewhere else she can curl up next to me all day, she will have a full-on emotional meltdown.\nBeyond increasing my back pain by about 5,000 percent, two things have become abundantly clear from this routine. One, I am a very weak man when faced with a sad dog. And two, my pup is way too attached. So, I enlisted the counsel of two experts to help reduce my dog’s clinginess at home.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nYour dog’s Velcro habits are cute—but not always convenient.\nWhy some dogs stick to your side\nThere are copious reasons why your dog may possess Velcro-like qualities. Susan Nilson, animal trainer and founder ofThe Cat and Dog House, confirms that this behavior is completely normal and, in many cases, just reflects how much they like you (aww).\nHowever, she offers an important caveat: “There is such a thing as being over-attached.” Nilson explains that dogs will often follow their pet parents around simply because they like being near them and are curious about what they’re up to.\nThese animals could also be anticipating something exciting like being fed or going for a walk. Not to mention, if they follow you around all day, they’re more likely to receive pets or other types of attention, which only leads them to repeat this behavior. So, as difficult as it can feel, it’s imperative to resist rewarding this behavior and other neediness staples,like whining.\nOn a less charming note, your pup might be clinging to you because they’re stressed or scared. As the one who takes care of them, they look to you for protection and reassurance.\n“Dogs, like children, tend to use their owners as a secure base, a bit like a security blanket,” Nilson says. Dr. Sabrina Kong, a veterinarian atJules Veterinary Centerin Tracy, California, explains that a lack of confidence or recent changes to their environment could be factors, as well.\n“Some dogs become clingy if they’re not used to being alone or experienced loss or change, such as moving to a new home or changing the family dynamic,” she says. In short, maybe you should stay togetherfor the kids.\nIf they’re following you around like your shadow, there’s a reason for that.\nAin’t no sunshine when you’re gone\nOf course, if this behavior is consistent every day, there’s likely a larger issue at play. Your pup could be suffering from separation anxiety, a condition I think we all know alittle too well. Unfortunately, Nilson notes that remedying this situation and managing its symptoms can be a delicate dance. According to the trainer, “separation anxiety needs a carefully structured approach to build up the length of time the dog can manage alone without being stressed.”\nAbove all, she recommends hiring a professional to help guide you and your dog through the process. But if you’re unable to do so due to time constraints or because you spent all your excess money on pain relief medication for your back, like me, the overarching goal is to help your pup feel safe when they’re alone.\nFor Nilson, this ideally involves a carefully tailored plan of desensitization and counterconditioning, in which you gradually increase the length of time your dog spends alone while rewarding calm and independent behavior.\nBut it’s important to remember that dog training is not a Vin Diesel movie and speed should not be the goal. “There is no timeline for this. We simply go at the dog’s pace and need to resist any temptation to rush things along,” she adds.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nShort-term solutions\nThat approach is all fine and dandy, but in the interim, most of us still have things to do, places to go, and backs to have massaged. Thankfully, there are short-term Band-Aid solutions to help limit this behavior in the present so you can still get some work done.\nNilson explains that providing amentally stimulating toyis often the best option in these scenarios. Offering your dog something like a snuffle mat or fillable toy will help keep them occupied while you do the dishes, exercise, or work to pay for their special tummy-sensitive dog food.\nNilson specificallysuggests a Kongor LickiMat;  they can be filled and frozen overnight to pose a greater and longer-lasting challenge. She explains that these tools arenatural stress relieversthat give pups a boost of endorphins. “When dogs are presented with a task where they have to engage their logical, thinking brain, it inhibits the emotional brain, meaning not only will they be happily distracted but also that they will be calmer and more relaxed overall.”\nEstablishing a scent game is another effective strategy to keep your dog occupied. Plus, Nilson points out that this can be done in a separate room apart from the one you’re trying to be productive in. These games involve scattering or hiding treats and allowing your pup to use their nose to find them.\nIt might even improve their health, as Nilson explains: “Research shows that sniffing lowers a dog’s pulse rate and blood pressure so this is another easy way to provide a mental challenge which will help keep your dog distracted and calm.”\nOther options include offering your dog something with your scent on it to provide additional comfort. Personally, I stopped lending clothes after losing my vintageGet Up Kidst-shirt to an ex, but I can make an exception here. “Dogs feel more secure when surrounded by their familiar scents and this is an easy way to help your dog feel more secure if they’re feeling anxious,” Nilson says. She also mentions dog-specific music or playlists you can find on YouTube or Spotify as effective tools to help further induce calmness.\nWhat to do when you don’t feel the close bond you want.\nHow to train your dog to be slightly more independent\nIf your dog was recently adopted or is still a puppy, you may be able to takeThe Terminatorroute and stop these issues before they ever develop. Dr. Kong explains that preventing this behavior requires proper socialization and training early on.\n“Encouraging independence, rewarding calm behavior, and avoiding reinforcing needy behavior inadvertently are crucial. Ensure your dog has a well-rounded life with plenty of social interactions, physical exercise, and mental stimulation,” she says.\nAdditionally, an early focus on commands like “stay” or “go to bed” will help teach your pet that being away from you is normal.I get it — it can behard to say goodbyewhen you leave, and coming home to a dog losing their mind about your resumed presence is a singularly wonderful experience. But Dr. Kong confirms these habits are not always in your pup’s best interest long-term. “It’s also fundamental to practice leaving and returning home without making a big fuss, which can help minimize anxiety related to your comings and goings,” she says.\nThe appeal of clingy dogs is clear: Everybody likes to feel needed. But it’s important to remember that it’s in everyone’s best interest if your pet can be a bit more independent. If not for them, do it for the health of your back. Take it from me — yoga classes only go so far.",

    },
    "page_content": "Dogs have many hidden talents, but their sense of smell is more like anunderestimatedtalent. Even the laziest dog has a nose firing at a million cylinders all the time. They can’t help it. A roly-poly pet always knows when to wander over to the kitchen just as food is coming out of the oven. A social dog checks the smell mail at their favorite tree stump on every walk. And when a bored or anxious dog chews up your shoes, they absolutely know they’reyours. So that’s why nose work for dogs is a rising sport amongst pet parents who realize turning their dog’s superpower into a fun activity with a competitive edge is great fun for both of them.\nWhat is nose work for dogs?\nNose work for dogs is a recreational sport very similar to scent tracking and is rapidly expanding in popularity among pet parents. The goal is for the dog to locate a hidden target scent and alert their handlers to its exact whereabouts in the environment. The tables are turned in this activity as the dog teaches the person to trust the dog’s superior scenting capabilities.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nK9 Nose Work® as a sport was developed in southern California in 2006 by a team of highly experienced individuals: Amy Herot, Jill Marie O’Brien, and Ron Gaunt — all professional trainers and handlers with working certified detection dogs. Herot writes, “Our detection dogs always look so satisfied and are relaxed after a search. It seemed like companion dogs should have the opportunity to enjoy the same benefits.”\nA “sniffari” gives your dog a chance to be the boss.\nThe great thing about nose work training for dogs is that any type of dog can participate — big or small — not just a special breed. “One of the greatest advantages,” adds Herot, “Is that the sport suits every kind of dog and the activity requires no previous skill on the part of the handler. Anyone can do it.”\nInexhaustible puppies, high-drive sport dogs, seniors, socially or physically challenged dogs and happy well-adjusted pets are all given equal access to the positive outlet that nose work training provides.\nBenefits of nose work for dogs\nBesides proving themselves superior with theirsense of smell, other benefits to nose work for your dog include constructive physical exercise and intensemental stimulation. The nose work training process encourages the dog to refine their innate hunting and scenting skills.\nOwners, on the other hand, get an advanced course on dog behavior by learning to read frequently overlooked subtleties of caninebody language. Handlers are taught to quietly support their dogs as the dogs develop individual searching styles.\nWhy is nose work dog training different?\nIn classic learning environments, like groupobedience classes, dogs may be either nervous or overstimulated and can have difficulty absorbing new information. Often pet parents are preoccupied with steering clear of the neighboring dog, and may be frustrated by their pet’s wary or overzealous nature. But in the nose work classroom, searches are run one by one, allowing dogs with any number of normally challenging behavioral issues to focus and learn.\nWorking individually and without social stimulation allows the dog to channel energy, leaving dog and handler free to concentrate and learn from each other. Natural dog behaviors commonly regarded as “uncivilized” are encouraged as part of drive building in the game of scenting and searching. Pulling through the door excitedly, turning full attention on the environment, and leaping about playfully are not considered problem behaviors here.\nThis sounds like a competition show waiting to happen.\nStart nose work training with your dog\nNose work adapted essential elements ofdetection dog traininginto a motivational and portable game specifically designed for companion dogs, requiringlittle spaceand minimal equipment to practice. Both physical exercise and mental stimulation can be met even within a small space. The thrill of exploration and pursuit seems to magnify the intensity of the game and compound the reward value.\nEncourage the dog to explore multiple open boxes for the scent of a hidden reward — usually a savory treat or a favorite toy.\nEncourage the dog to explore multiple open boxes for the scent of a hidden reward — usually a savory treat or a favorite toy.\nGradually increase search difficulty by changing environmental variables: closing the boxes, raising the height of the hide, introducing varied objects to the search environment and eventually moving the search outside of the box.\nGradually increase search difficulty by changing environmental variables: closing the boxes, raising the height of the hide, introducing varied objects to the search environment and eventually moving the search outside of the box.\nWhile the dog catches on to the game and builds drive for searching, pair the target odor with the reinforcing treat.\nWhile the dog catches on to the game and builds drive for searching, pair the target odor with the reinforcing treat.\nGo at your dog’s pace (and as you get better at reading behavioral indicators).

The only prerequisite for trialing is passing the Odor Recognition Test (ORT), in which the dog identifies the appropriate target odor for his level of competition: sweet birch for NW1, aniseed for NW2, clove bud for NW3. Elements of competition include box drills, interior building, exterior area, and vehicle searches. Practicing for competition is easy and can be done just about anywhere.\nWith nose work dog training, pet parents learn to trust their dogs to be the best guides and teachers. Here, the dog is always right, always good, and we are allowed an opportunity to achieve a better understanding of them. Nose work succeeds as a method for deepening relationships with canine companions as people learn how they experience the world.",

    "page_content": "When it comes to dog training and behavior, there are a few kernels of wisdom that I feel compelled to share as often as possible. One of these is the value of a frozen Kong, which universally makes life better for your dog (and you!). Keep reading to learn why — plus, how to stuff a frozen Kong for endless entertainment.\nThe benefits of a frozen Kong\nKongs are a wonderful way to feed your dog in a way that keeps them occupied. When the food inside the Kong is frozen, it takes longer for your dog to get it all out, which provides them a greater opportunity forproblem solving, mental exercise, and using their mouths in the physical way that so many dogs need.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThis is valuable because many dogs require moremental stimulationthan you can provide them each day. Working to get food out of a toy is much more satisfying to the majority of dogs than eating it straight from the bowl. It involves the chewing and licking so many dogs enjoy. It keeps dogs occupied for a long time. It provides them the opportunity to problem solve and to stick to one task for a long time.\nHaving a dog work on a Kong can be useful for you, too. It allows you to prevent trouble that is predictable at certain times of day. Many dogs seem a bit bored and restless in the mid-morning and again in the late afternoon, and this is when much misbehavior happens. Giving them a frozen Kong just ahead of those times that they are predictably not at their best can be a sanity saver for everyone.\nSimilarly, if you know your dog gets overly excited whenvisitors come over, have a frozen Kong ready to give to your dog just before they enter. If your dog is already happily engaged with this treasure, they are less likely to beoverly exuberantin their greeting, and that’s good for everyone. (If your dog tends to guard special objects or food, it’s wise to have them in a crate or in another room with their Kong when visitors come over, just to be on the safe side.)\nDon’t hit pause on your pet’s playtime – these solo activities will help 9-5 fly by for them.\nHow to stuff a frozen Kong\nStuffing Kongs is like any other kitchen endeavor — there are plenty of strategies and techniques that make it easier and better, but there’s no one right way to do it. For dogs without a lot of positive experiences with a Kong, it’s important to make it easy so they have success early on. The big solid chunk formed from a full Kong that is frozen stiff might be too hard for beginners to extract, and that can be a problem unless you work up to it.\nYou don’t want a novice dog to get frustrated and give up on Kongs before they’ve learned how wonderful they are. Start with Kongs that are not frozen so that they can easily get what’s inside. Once they love them and will not likely give up, make it just a little harder. Here are my general guidelines for stuffing a Kong:\nWith the first few frozen Kongs, one option is to line just the surface of it withpeanut butter, cream cheese, canned food, or some other soft treat. You can also fill the Kong three-quarters full and freeze it, then add unfrozen easy-to-get soft stuff in the last quarter just before you give it to your dog.\nTo keep it upright and make it easier to stuff, put it the Kong in a cup or glass with the large opening facing up. Squeeze the Kong to make the opening oblong when you are putting in large items or using a spoon to scoop in goopy ones. The tighter you pack the Kong, the more challenging it will be for the dog to get it, so start with loose packing and work up to the greater (and longer lasting!) challenge for your dog.\nI like to stuff Kongs in layers before I freeze them.To keep foods from spilling out of the bottom, smaller hole, first put in something that acts as a stopper and is also so delicious that your dog will stay interested in the Kong until it is empty. You can use a piece of chicken or steak, cheese, peanut butter, or anything your dog really loves.\nNext, I put in a little canned dog food to keep everything together when frozen. The next layer is small pieces of dog treats, again followed by canned food. Depending on the size of the Kong and how generous I am being with the other layers, I may put in some dog kibble, and this is especially true if the dog tends to take meals with a Kong. After I’ve put in the next bit of canned food to almost fill the Kong, I add a long, hard treat sticking out so that the dog is sure to be interested in the Kong and get something from it right away.\nThe bottom line: Frozen Kongs have made my life better by making life better for my dogs. I hope it does the same for you.",

    "page_content": "When it comes to training your pup, you probably already know that treats are one of the most effective ways to tell them they did a good job (and should do whatever they just did again). But if you want your pup to learn most effectively, treats alone aren’t the solution.A new studypublished inScientific Reportsfinds that as much as your pup wants a snack, they equally value your positive emotional reinforcement.\nRecently, researchers set out to measure how emotions influence learning in pups and found that dogs who received pets and praise in addition to treats performed better than pups who received treats and light reprimanding. In other words, keep the treats coming — but if you want your dog to be stress-free and in peak performance, they’ll need tons of chin scratches and “good dog” affirmations, too.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nItispowerful enough, even for the tough cases, and itisthe best choice—here’s why.\nThe experiment\nDuring the experiment, trainers taught new cue words to pups for tricks they already knew; instead of being given the cues in Hungarian, which their pet parents speak, the dogs were given cues in English. Two different training styles were given to each pup: “permissive” and “controlling.”\nDuring permissive training sessions, dogs who succeeded were given praise, pets, and treats. During controlling sessions, dogs who succeeded were given treats (without praise and pets) and dogs who failed were softly scolded with phrases such as “No,” or “Not good,” in a firm, but not threatening, voice.\nOffering fewer treats can actually be agoodthing.\nAfter each separate training session, dogs napped in a lab, where they were given EEG scans to analyze their memory functions. Performance was retested after sleep.\nThe researchers found that the controlling training method caused pups stress and increased the amount they slept. In particular, dogs who were scolded showed the stress-related behavior of seeking proximity to their pet parent.Previous studieshave found that stress can have a negative impact on a dog’s ability to learn.\nAll dogs performed better during their first training session than the second, regardless of the method applied. “The reason for the order effect may be the well-known phenomenon in the literature that information learned first is often easier to remember than what is learned later in a similar context,”per Phys.org.\nThere was one difference, though: Dogs who were first exposed to controlling sessions and later exposed topermissive sessions showed much greater pre- to post-sleep improvement during their second sessions. Researchers hypothesize that this may be because the pups experienced a more positive training environment than they expected.\n“Our results indicate a central role of positive reinforcement both in enhancing their performance and welfare,” wrote the study’s lead author, Vivien Reicher. Further research is needed to delve into the impact of positive reinforcement on learning, but these results suggest that giving pets and praise to pups can significantly lower stress and potentially improve their memory — so, no need to play the stoic trainer. Go ahead and smother your pup in pets; it’s good for everyone.\nReferences:\nPotential Interactive Effect of Positive Expectancy Violation and Sleep on Memory Consolidation in Dogs\nPotential Interactive Effect of Positive Expectancy Violation and Sleep on Memory Consolidation in Dogs\nStudy Shows Rewarding Dogs with Praise and Petting Helps Them Learn More Efficiently\nStudy Shows Rewarding Dogs with Praise and Petting Helps Them Learn More Efficiently\nTraining Methods and Owner–Dog Interactions: Links With Dog Behaviour and Learning Ability\nTraining Methods and Owner–Dog Interactions: Links With Dog Behaviour and Learning Ability",

    "page_content": "Not to be dramatic, but a visit to the veterinarian can be the most stressful half hour of your dog’s year. The small rooms, the needles, the prodding hands, the slippery tables. Listen, who wouldn’t get a little antsy under these circumstances?\nBut because seeing a vet is a non-negotiable over your dog’s lifetime, the best course of action is to set them — and yourself — up for success. The good news is that it’s possible for animals to develop a neutral relationship with the big, bad (wonderful, hard-working) vet. But keeping your dog calm is a team effort. “It’s not only the vet’s job, but it’s the pet parent’s job, too,” says veterinarian Dr. Alex Schechter, founder ofBurrwood Veterinaryin Detroit.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nLucky for us, veterinarians and veterinary behaviorists have thoughts on how to prep your pet for the trip. Below are eight ways to not only keep your pup healthy — but happy, too.\nIt’s extra important to be nice to the vet in your life.\n1. Look for that “Fear Free” certification at the vet.\nVets at your local clinic cantake a courseand get a Fear Free certification. In short, the course teaches techniques for low-stress handling andanxiety minimization. It prioritizes treats and distraction over forceful manual restraints when vets need to administer shots or draw blood. Knowing that your clinic has this training, or any training based on a philosophy you agree with, can ensure you’re on the same page before you walk through their doors.\nYou, the pet parent, should be as free of fear as possible, too, so make sure you’re working with apractice you generally like.Your dog will follow your cues, and being at ease sets a good example.\n“‘Find a vet that’s the right fit for you, so that when you’re there, you’re also relaxed and comfortable because if the pet parent’s anxious and nervous, their pets feed off that a little bit,” Dr. Schechter adds.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\n2. Introducing “happy visits,” aka going to the vet even when there’s nothing technically wrong.\nOne of the tenets of Fear Free certification is desensitization. You can desensitize a dog to the vet by dropping in for a visit and a treat with some frequency throughout the year. They’re called “happy visits,” and the point is to build up positive associations with your clinic of choice, so when you go in for your dog’s annual check-up orfor an emergency, they don’t automatically begin to pant.\n“Most vets are going to be very open to [drop ins] because when pets are very anxious it impacts every part of the visit,” veterinarian Dr. Stephanie Liff, the medical director and owner ofPure Paws Vet Carein New York City, says (her practice is fear-free certified). “Everyone is stressed, the dog has a bad experience, it’s hard to do an exam. Sometimes, it’s impossible to get bloodwork if you need it. So a happy, calm pet at the vet is very good for everyone.”\nThe visits can take just a couple minutes, and Dr. Liff suggests going as often as your schedule allows, which could mean once a week, once a month, or a few times a year. You arrive, say hello to the front-of-office employees, and give your dog ahigh-value treat,praise, or do a quick play session.\nReduce the stress of veterinary visits — for you and your pup.\n3. Practice more focused desensitization techniques.\nPair the drop-in visits with the other desensitization techniques that will prep your dog for how they will be handled and inspected at the vet. And — this part’s important — start as soon as possible once your dog comes home with you.\n“Don’t even wait until you see your dog is fearful,” says veterinarian Dr. Vanessa Spano, the director of veterinary services at the ASPCA Adoption Center in New York City. “You could work with trainers — ideally, it would be a trainer [who uses]positive reinforcementin theory — and do a protocol of desensitization to handling where you gradually acclimate the pet to very subtle handling at first.”\n“If you want to do desensitization correctly, whether it involves vet visits or de-sensitizing to kids, or whatever it is, you always want to set the bar really really low,” Dr. Spano adds.\nShelby Semel, Head of Training and Behavior atAnimal Haven Shelterin New York City and founder ofShelby Semel Dog Training, suggests paying attention to your dog’s distinct vulnerabilities. If they don’t like to have their ears touched due to too many infections or they never liked to have their paws touched, begin there.\nDesensitization can take time. For example, Semel worked with a Havanese who had an issue with people touching his paw. She began teaching him the paw cue, which was like a “low five.” Then, instead of the quick touch and release, she held his paw for a moment longer. From there, Semel worked on touching his paw after he completed the cue.\n“It took four and a half months, but now I can touch his dog’s paw, and he doesn’t care,” Semel says.\n4. You can B.Y.O.Yoga Mat.\nDogs can feel uncomfortable when picked up and placed on high areas, especially when those areas are metal and slippery. Dr. Spano recommends asking the vet to examine them on the floor. If that’s not possible, bring a yoga mat.\n“If we’re on a slippery floor, we lose our balance. That’s really fear-inducing, so it’s important to have traction. I would take out a yoga mat to put on the exam table,” Dr. Spano says.\nYou can teach them “place” with the yoga mat as well, so they are fulfilling a familiar cue for which they know they’ll be rewarded.\n5. Say no to nail trims.\nMaybe you’ve worked hard on desensitizing your dog and their paws to clippers. That’s wonderful, but save the payoff for the groomer or yourat-home nail clipping. Dr. Schechter doesn’t recommend getting your dog’s grooming done at the vet.\n“We want to create as stress-free an environment as possible,” he says. “If we do non-medical things like nail trims, which dogs hate, then when they actually come here as a necessity, they’ll be nervous and uncomfortable.”\nHere are some options your vet can help you consider.\n6. Try good, old-fashioned anxiety medication.\nKnow thesigns of anxiety in your dog,the ones that you can detect in their body language, like shaking, tail between their legs, ears back, eyes bugging to the point you can see the whites of the eyeball, and licking their lips. If you see that your pet has vet anxiety, share that information when booking an appointment. They can prescribe some medication for the dog and couple the meds with drop-in “happy visits” in the week leading up to the appointment (during which time you give them their most high-value treat).\n“We’re very liberal about prescribing anxiety medications for patients that have anxiety, because more bad experiences lead to more bad experiences, so the sooner you can intervene, the better,” Dr. Liff says.\nIt’s also OK to try again later, this time with meds. “If we see them and they’re too anxious, we’ll have them come back on a different day on prescription medication to help relax them a little bit as opposed to manually restraining them,” Dr. Schechter adds.\nIt will be super helpful if you ever need a pet-sitter, too.\n7. Consider at-home or telemedicine appointments.\nSometimes, a dog’s stress comes fromtheir ownbad experiences at a place, and sometimes itcomes from the smellofotherdogs’ anxiety in that place. Either way, a home visit from a vet may be a good option for them. It’s a growing mode of service, especially in major metropolitan areas. (On the other hand, and perhaps obviously, this would not be a good option for dogs who are territorial of their homes.)\nAnother choice in some states is telemedicine. “You need to set up a legal vet-client-patient relationship (VCPR) with a vet that’s pre-existing, but once that’s done, telehealth or telemedicine is really valuable because you’re not bringing your dog to the clinic or an unfamiliar place, you can ask your vet all those questions, tell them the medical history, and then you’ve taken away like 30 minutes of the appointment without the dog being afraid,” Dr. Spano of the ASPCA says.\nTelemedicine is not an option in all states, so you’ll need to look intoyour own state’s laws; the ASPCA isactively advocatingfor those laws to be updated.\n8. Ace the administration portion of the visit.\n“Emailing or making sure you have yourvaccine records or medical historyif you’re transferring to a different vet or if you moved again is smart,” Dr. Schechter says. “It just makes it a much smoother process.”\nAnd, as Dr. Spano points out, if you have all this paperwork, plus updated information on your dog’s diet, at the ready, that leaves more time for you to dedicate to low-stress handling, and giving your pup all the time they need to have a relaxed time — or at least a neutral time — at the vet.\nReferences:\nFear-Free Certification Course\nFear-Free Certification Course\nVeterinary Telehealth: The Basics\nVeterinary Telehealth: The Basics\nPosition Statement on Veterinary Telemedicine\nPosition Statement on Veterinary Telemedicine",

    "page_content": "Welcoming a new dog into your life is an exciting time, whether you’re a brand-new pet parent or an experienced one. Either way, there will be plenty of decisions to make, supplies to stock up on, and questions to ask, like: How will you train your new friend, and what will you need to have on hand for training sessions?\nThe TL;DR answer is to give your dog treats when they do what you want them to do. But of course, there’s a lot more to it than that. Here’s how, why, and what kinds of treats to use to train your dog — plus, the biggest mistake most people make when using dog treats for training.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhy you should use treats during training\n“Should I use treats to train my dog?”\nIt’s a question many new pet parents ponder — especially if they’re concerned about creating a situation where their dog becomes, well,a treat hound. After all, you want your dog to behave even when you don’t have something yummy in your pocket to entice them. But while wanting your dog to follow commands without resorting to bribery (or getting them hooked on treats) is understandable, using treats to train dogs is a tried-and-true method for good reason: it works.\n“Positive reinforcement has been shown to be the most effective way to train a dog,” says Sean Prichard, a certified canine fitness coach (CCFC) and president atPant & Wag. And what does positive reinforcement look like when it comes to dogs? “Positive reinforcement training simply means the dog gets a reward for a desired behavior,” Prichard says. “For food-motivated dogs, the easiest and best reward is usually a treat.”\nHere are some tips for fitting training into your action-packed schedule.\nResearch backs this up: A March 2023 study found that although you can use social interaction to train your pup, food is far more effective (for the most part — because just like humans,all dogs are different).\nThe bottom line? Using dog treats for training can be great incentive for your dog. Make sure to select a small, flavorful treat your dog loves. The treatswill act as positive reinforcementwhen your dog exhibits the desired behavior you are training for. To correctly use the treats, immediately reward your dog and offer verbal praise. Stay consistent to reinforce the behavior. Gradually, you can replace the high-value treats with other positive reinforcement, such as praise or play.\nKeep reading to find out more about how to use treats for dog training, what to use as training treats for dogs, the best training treats for dogs, and even how to make your own dog treats for training (did someone say DIY?).\nHow to use treats during training sessions\nThe first, and perhaps most important, step in training your pup is to approach the situation with humor, positivity, and a big dose of patience.\nA study published in the July 2011 issue ofApplied Animal Behaviour Sciencefound that dogs whose parents were playful and patient did better at learning new tasks, anda 2004 studypublished by Cambridge University Press highlighted the effectiveness of rewards versus punishment when teaching dogs to do a variety of things including sit on command, heel, drop an object, come when called, and stop stealing food.\nIt’s important to remember that dogs are individuals, so training isn’t one-size-fits-all.\n“Punishment was associated with an increased incidence of problematic behaviors,” the Cambridge authors wrote, concluding that there was no benefit to yelling or physical discipline and that positive training methods work much better.\nYou’ll also want to keep the following things in mind when you're treat-training your dog:\n“The best way to use treats is in conjunction with a clicker,” says Lorrie Reynolds, owner ofMaximum Fun Dog Sports. To teach or practice the behavior you want, follow three simple steps: cue the behavior (this is when you say “heel” or “sit”), mark the behavior with the clicker as soon as your dog does it, then give the treat.\nNever used a clicker before? Reynolds suggests a brief training session to get your pup to associate the clicker with the treat. “Click the clicker and give a treat in rapid succession ten or so times, then wait for the dog to get distracted and click the clicker. If the dog turns back, you know the pairing was successful. If not, do another round until the dog understands what the click means.”\nCan you use dog food as training treats? Think of it this way: Would you do what someone told you just because they offered you a spoonful of your go-to overnight oats as a reward? Probably not — even if you enjoy them at breakfast. Your dog is no different.\nPro tips on training your dog with the click of a button — literally.\n“The treats need to be of high value to the dog; the more the dog enjoys the treat, the more likely they will reproduce the desired behavior to get another treat,” Prichard says. So, if you want your pup to get enthusiastic about following commands, skip the everyday fare.\nWhats the difference? “Bribery is basically ‘See this? Now do that and you get this,’” says Ali Smith, dog behavior consultant and founder ofRebarkable. A reward, on the other hand, is givenafteryour dog sits, stays, heels, shakes hands, or whatever you're trying to get them to do. “Positive reinforcement is ‘Do this? Yeah! Well done, have this!’” Smith says.\nNo one is saying your dog isn’t smart —brilliant, even — but when it comes to using treats for training, they may not have the best memory as to what they’re being rewarded for. “It’s important that the treat is given immediately after the desired behavior is achieved; many people wait too long,” Prichard says. “Even waiting a single second can reduce the effectiveness of training.”\nWhen training a new member of your household, Smith is a proponent of giving treats  “as often as possible for anything your dog does right, whether that’s cued or naturally performed.” That means you don’t have to be actively conducting a training session in order to toss out a few treats.\nThe key to curbing mindless snacking — this is for your dog.\n“Science has shown us time after time that positive reinforcement is the most effective and least risky way to train,” Smith says. So, go ahead and dole out those treats whenever you see behavior you want to encourage. (Carrying atreat pouch for dog traininghelps ensure you’ll always have some on hand.)\nAll good things must come to an end, and that includes getting rewarded for every single “sit,” “stay,” “heel,” and “leave it!” That doesn’t mean you’ll never give your dog treats once they learn the ropes — it just means that after a while, you can leave that dog treat pouch at home when you head out for a stroll with your best friend.\n“If treats are overused, a dog may become reliant on them for obedience,” Prichard says. “Gradually reduce treat frequency as the behavior becomes ingrained.”\nHow to choose the right training treat for your dog\nIn order for treat-training to work, your dog needs to really want that treat — so it’s got to be good. But you also want the treat to be goodforthem. “I could probably train my dog to do my taxes using ice cream and hot dogs as incentives, but it wouldn’t be worth the harm it would cause to her,” Prichard says. “Dog parents and trainers need to find a balance between high-value treats, while also being conscious of the dog’s health. Many treats are void of nutrition and loaded with calories and sugar which is detrimental to a dog’s fitness level.”\nSmith likes to use liver, cheese, dried chicken hearts, and other meats or meat byproducts, and points out that the treats only need to be pea-sized. Reynolds concurs: “Higher-quality treats are more expensive, but dogs don’t care how big the treats are. You can successfully train with treats cut into pea-sized pieces, soone bag of treatsgoes a long way.”\nA dog behaviorist schools us on why puppy classes are more about socializing than getting straight As.\nCommon mistakes when using training treats\nIf you follow the above steps and guidelines, you’ll likely have success with training your dog using treats. Prichard and Reynolds called out a few of the most common mistakes people make:\n“Luring to initially teach a behavior is fine, but once the dog understands what the owner wants, the treat should not come out before the behavior occurs,” Reynolds says. “If a dog will only perform a behavior if the food is present, treats have been used as bribes instead of rewards.”\nPrichard agrees, adding: “Avoid using treats to lure your dog into a behavior. The reward should come after the desired action, not before.”\n“If the handler asks for a ‘sit’ but then presents the treat where the dog has to get up to get it, they have rewarded getting up, not sitting,” Reynolds says. Giving the treat the instant your dog performs the desired behavior is crucial for this reason. (And if you find yourself getting nipped when your dog excitedly chomps their reward, here are some tips onteaching your dog to take treats gently.)\nOn a practical level, Prichard points out that keeping treats pea-sized is easier for both you and your pup. Not only will you be able to hold more in your hand, your dog will gobble them up quickly “so they don’t spend the entire training session chewing.”\nThe questions to ask and credentials to look out for to find the right trainer foryourdog, according to a pro.\nYou want to watch how many treats you give for a couple of reasons. First is your dog’s health: “Treats contribute to your dog’s daily caloric intake. Ignoring portion control can lead to overfeeding and potential health issues,” Prichard says.\nWorried you’re being too stingy with the treats? Reynolds says to put that thought out of your head. “A single treat or a handful of treats presented all at once are the same to a dog.” If your dog has mastered something they’ve struggled with, however, it’s OK to reward them a little extra. “Multiple treats given one at a time make a bigger impact when the dog has done something especially well,” Reynolds says.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nWhile dog trainers say treats are the easiest and most effective way to teach behavior, they’re not the only thing your pup will respond to. “Treats should be just one tool in your training toolbox,” Prichard says. “A well-rounded training approach includes a mix of positive reinforcement including treats and verbal praise, exercise, and socialization.”\nWant to make your own training treats? It’s easy — just chop your dog’s favorite treat (cheese, liver) into pea-sized bites, and you’re in business. In fact, your dog may prefer your homemade treats to store-bought ones. “[Many people believe] dogs prefer highly processed treats; usually that’s not the case,” Smith says.\nIf you want to get a little fancier in the kitchen, there are plenty ofrecipes you can whip upthat aresure to make your dog drool. Now, the only thing you need to worry about is keeping your friends and family from spoiling all you and your pup’s hard work (possibly by sneaking them too many treats on the side).

    "page_content": "Bandit has always been a very energetic dog. He gets so hyper and can’t control himself. It has ended up with him mildly injuring my husband and I. I really need to teach him self-control. We just can’t seem to ever get enough energy out, no matter how many walks or playtimes. I’m desperate! — Anna\nHey, Anna!\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nAn overexcited dog can easily overwhelm their pet parents. Besides the fact that it can make many activities challenging, it can also become a downright dangerous situation. The possibility of knocking people over, scratching,nipping, or even inadvertently head-butting someone who is bending down to greet them can make this issue a real liability.\nIf you add young children or elderly folks into the mix, a jumping dog can be an accident waiting to happen. The key is prevention. If you want to know how to train a dog not to jump on people, here are some simple tools you can use.\nWhy dogs greet by jumping\nIt might sound obvious, but dogs usually greet by jumping because they’resimply excited.Dogs are social, and jumping up togreet a personbrings them closer to the person’s face and eye-level. They may want attention and pets from the person they’re seeing. Sometimes, dogs continue jumping, because they receive a positive award — such as attention and head scratches — from the person they jump on.\nTrain your dog to stop jumping\nEven though it may be innocent, your guests might not like having a jumping dog barreling toward them. Luckily, there are ways to stop a dog from jumping.\nExercise is super important, but it’s only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to a dog who is overly energetic. Adding alternative forms of exercise, such as mental stimulation and environmental enrichment, are critical to keep the energy at bay.\nThis engages your dog in problem-solving techniques, binds anxiety/energy, and improves communication. It can be incorporated daily within your normal home routine. Consistently practicingbasic obedience cuesand incorporating those skills into your daily routine is a great way to reinforce what your dog already may know and also introduce them to some new training protocols.\nKeep the training fun and consistent. Make sure to mix it up so your dog remains interested and you keep them on their toes.\nThis can be done withinteractive feeding toyswhich engage your dog in foraging and dissecting behaviors while consuming their daily meals. Another option is playing a game of hide and seek withsome treats hiddenaround the house.Scent-tracking gamesare a lot of fun as well. There are also manygreat chew toysout there that can help your dog bind some of that anxiety and/or extra energy through rigorous chewing.\nDespite your best efforts, an over-excited dog may still go totally bonkerswhen guests arriveor if your kids start running around the house. This may take a specific approach that includes teaching self-control and implementing a management plan.\nAnd why you shouldn’t skip the longer routes.\nYour first priority should be to reinforce and practice your basic foundation skills. Make sure Bandit has a good grip on basic cues, such as “sit,” “come,” “stay,” “go to your mat,” etc. If he seems to be struggling, find abasic obedience or manners classorhire a certified professional dog trainer for some private lessons. Be sure to do your research and seek out trainers who are certified and practice positive reinforcement techniques.\nOnce Bandit has the basics down, you want to focus on teaching him how to stay calm while exciting things are happening in his environment. Start by teaching Bandit to go to a dog bed or mat on cue — choose a designated spot that he can be instructed to “go to mat.” Once he is eagerly complying, ask him for a “stay.”\nDo this several times while you slowly increase your distance as you move away from him. Slowly increase the duration of time you expect him to “stay.”  The next step is to introduce some distractions around him during his “stay.” Make sure to reward him for completing the task with a high-value food treat and positive praise.\nOnce he can go to his mat and stay for 20 to 30 seconds, add more and morechallenging distractions. Clap your hand, jump up and down, sit on the floor, sing at the top of your lungs — you get the idea. Over the course of a few weeks, you want to be able to build up to knocking at the door, ringing the doorbell,eating on the floor, running back and forth, etc., the idea being that you can help Bandit control himself by teaching him to eagerly perform an incompatible behavior and desensitizing him to excitingenvironmental triggers.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nBe consistent to have successful training\nThroughout your training journey, it’s inevitable that Bandit will get up to his old tricks and occasionally go nuclear when you are answering the door or greeting a friend while out on a walk. We will need to respond to his behavior in a way that helps him realize that we don’t appreciate it.\nDogs will always repeat behaviors that are successful to them. If jumping, barking or grabbing at clothes gets all the attention in the room directed toward him, he will see this as very fruitful. Even negative attention isstillattention.\nUtilizing time outs are an effective way to show him his hyperactive behaviors are working against him. When he exhibits these behaviors, calmly remove him from the room. In cases where you can predict a situation where you know he will get overstimulated, employ the use of a house leash which he can drag around indoors. This way the moment he jumps, you can say “too bad” and escort him to a bathroom or bedroom using the leash.\nTime-outs should be short. Fifteen or 30 seconds of isolation from the provoking stimulus will do. If he comes out all jazzed up and repeats the behavior, immediately repeat the time out steps again. He should not be able to engage in the stimulating activity until he has noticeably calmed down. Avoid yelling or being too forceful while going through this new ritual, as this will only add excitement and frustration to the situation and likely exacerbate his behavior.\nIf you are out for a walk, and he gets overzealous over someone you meet, you can remove him from the person the moment he begins his excitable behaviors. Move back by about three to five feet, redirect his behavior, and then re-approach the person when he is calm and repeat as needed. Be sure to praise and reward Bandit for appropriate behavior. It’s not enough to tell him what not to do; you need to let him know when he is doing things well.\nIt’s important to realize that while time outs can be effective, they will not be enough on their own. The training exercises should be your focus. If he can learn how to control his enthusiasm in a controlled and manageable setting, you will do much better than relying on timeouts alone. Especially in a setting where the stakes are high and you are too distracted and he is too excited.\nRemember: You are teaching, not testing. Go slow, and work at Bandit’s pace. This is going to take some time. Be patient as he already has a default behavior that he has been practicing with varied success for some time. It will be challenging for him to suddenly stop his excitable behavior and switch gears, but with knowledge, patience, and perseverance, you should see steady progress. Practice makes progress. Happy training!\nThe first rule of thumb for you: patience.\nFAQs (People Also Ask)\nWhen it comes to how to train a dog not to jump on strangers, you will need to utilize time-outs, reward appropriate behavior, and be consistent.

By usingpositive reinforcement techniquesand gradually increasing the duration and distance of the“stay”cue, you can teach your dog to stay in place until you release them.\nThe most mouth-watering treats for training your pup.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHow to train a dog to sit and stay\nFirst, choose which behavior you would like your dog to “stay” in — you can pick “sit” or  “down.” Your dog must understand the basics of how to achieve these positions before you can teach them how to stay still in them.\nTeaching your dog impulse control is a great way to build their understanding of not moving when asked. Begin with a dog treat in the palm of your hand and hold the treat about 10 inches from your dog’s face. If your dog moves for the treat, close your hand, if they stay still and do not move, bring your hand to your dog and reward them with a treat (do not let the dog come to your hand to get the treat). When working on impulse control, you will not use any cues. The action alone of closing your hand when your dog moves will be enough communication to train your dog what to do.\nContinue to increase the duration with your palm open so that your dog has to wait before being rewarded with the treat. Impulse control helps you train a dog who waits to get what they want and looks to you for confirmation, rather than pouncing.\nOnce your dog can stay in the position and waits to be rewarded you can begin to make it harder. This is where your patience comes into play; your dog is used to following you around, so take your time and go slow. Remember, when training your dog, setting them up for success during the initial training sessions and preventing them from making mistakes will make the overall process easier.\nNext, you will continue to practice impulse control and begin to add movement to it. You no longer need a treat in your hand. Keep it in your treat pouch some where accessible to reward your dog quickly when they get something right. Take a small step away from your dog (maybe five inches). If your dog stays in one spot, reward them.\nYour dog may tilt their body slightly but should not move their feet from where they are. Each time you reward your dog with a treat, count to five then release them with the word “free.” When you tell your dog “free,” allow them to move from their spot. This will help them learn to differentiate between staying still and moving.  When they are getting a movement break, let your dog walk around or sniff, don’t play with them; you don’t want to make the break fun. You want the “stay” to be more rewarding than freedom.\nIf your dog moves as you take a step away, you will now begin to use a sound marker to tell them moving was incorrect. As soon as your dog takes a step, you want to say “ehh, ehh” and take a step into their space. This should help position them back where they started. Be sure to be very specific with your timing here. It’s important to take action as soon as your dog moves for them to understand what you are trying to communicate.\nWhen you use the sound “ehh, ehh” and move into their space, you want to make it sound serious — but neutral. You are not yelling at your dog; you are only telling them moving was not what you asked them to do. As you likely noticed, we have not added the cue “stay” yet. Adding a word to this behavior comes down the line when they understand what you are asking them to do.\nAs your dog begins to understand they get rewarded for staying in place when you take a small step away from them, you may continue to increase the difficulty. Start by working on the stay as you move either left or right. Take a step to the right. If the dog stays, go back and reward them. Take a step to the left, and go back and reward the dog if they stay. Take two steps to the side — go back and reward. Take three steps go back, and reward.\nRemember to only make it more difficult after your dog has had a few successful repetitions staying at each level. Don’t forget to take movement breaks. You always want to release your dog with “free” before they move independently. The more you can train this behavior without the dog getting out of the position on their own, the easier it will be for you both.\nYour goal: The point of going left or right is to eventually make a full circle around your dog without them moving from the position. The difficulty increases as you get closer and closer to your dog’s hind end. Standing behind your dog is the most difficult. Your dog typicallyfollows you around, and when you walk behind them, they can not see you which becomes hard for them. Focus on taking this slow; most dogs will mess up the first time their owners are out of sight.\nNote: Always be sure to walk back to your dog to reward them. You do not want to make them come to you for the treat, because that confuses them.\nOnce you can get around your dog, introduce the word/cue “stay” and a hand signal. You only want to introduce the cue when you are 95 percent sure your dog will stay in position and not break. The more you say “stay” and your dog moves without beginning release, the more the cue becomes washed-out and less effective.\nAdding a hand signal and a cue is helpful; try holding your hand out, similar to a stop sign. Dogs can understand body language a lot more than they can understand verbal cues, so it is important to teach the word and hand signal at the same time.\nNow, it is time to increase your distance. When introducing a new level of difficulty, reward your dog faster and more often. As your dog becomes stronger at the skill of staying, you can fade the amount of treats and frequency of treats given. Over time, you can work on leaving their sight and asking them to stay as you step out of the room.\nItispowerful enough, even for the tough cases, and itisthe best choice—here’s why.\nCommon dog-training cue mistakes to avoid\nWhen making a behavior more difficult, you do not want to add duration simultaneously. You should only add one or the other as you are making things more complicated. Over time, you will be able to add the two together.\nDogs do not interpret words the same way we do. They learn a certain sound and begin to associate those sounds with certain behaviors. When choosing cues, try to pick words that end with different sounds or syllables. If a cue word sounds too similar to another, it will make it hard for your dog to differentiate what you are asking.\nIf you ask your dog to do a behavior, always remember to release them; that way they don’t break the behavior on their own, causing the behavior to fall apart. An example would be if you ask your dog to sit for a photo, let them know when you are done and no longer need them to stay put.\nWhen teaching your dog a new trick or behavior, it’s OK to use a lot of treats. This helps them build a positive association about the behavior. As time goes on, and they have a better understanding you can begin to fade out the treats.\nWhen moving to a new location or adding a new level of difficulty, go slow. Remember, it’s always best to set your dog up to succeed from the beginning, rather than trying something and letting them fail when they are learning something new.\nIt‘s best to teach your dog the trick or behavior and once your dog is solid at completing the behavior then begin to add the word. This helps you keep the value of your cue word and sets your dog up for success.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nWhy won’t my dog listen to cues?\nDogs do not generalize skills easily. Generalizing a skill means you learned how to do something, and you can do that skill anywhere at a given time. Most dogs need to be taught different behaviors in different locations under many types of distractions before you can say your dog has mastered a behavior.\nAn example: If your dog answers to their name in your house, but then you take them to a new park, and they don’t come when called. Each time you go to a new location, it’s always best to start with the basics of the behavior to help set your dog up for success.\nIf you use a cue word over and over and your dog is not responding to it, you are diluting the value of the cue. Each time you say your cue word and your dog is too distracted or does not respond, that word is losing value to them.\nTeaching your dog a “stay” can keep them safe and help you have a dog you can take to all your favorite places without worrying. Positive reinforcement is a great way to teach “stay” in an engaging manner so that your dog learns to love staying still.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nTraining a dog to sit and stay differs, depending on the dog and how much you work on the skill. If you follow the above steps and use patience, your dog should be able to sit and stay within a generally short amount of time.",

      "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/kristi-noem-behaviorist-response-news"
    },
    "page_content": "South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noemhas been criticized— by politicians from the right and from the left, comedians, dog trainers, animal welfare activists, and concerned citizens — for her extreme treatment of her dog. As revealed in an excerpt from her upcoming book published inThe Guardian,Noem shot her 14-month-old Wirehaired Pointer, Cricket, for behavior thatpositive reinforcementproponent dog trainer Zak Georgedescribed to CNNas “very typical adolescent behavior out of a dog that’s been bred to have endless stamina and endurance.”\nNoem writes in her new book,No Going Back: The Truth on What’s Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forwardthat she took her young dog on a pheasant hunt where she was “out of her mind with excitement, chasing all those birds and having the time of her life.”\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nLater, after Noem failed to control her dog with basic measures like putting her on a leash, the dog attacked and killed a neighbor’s chickens. Following that incident, Noem said, “I hated that dog,” called her “untrainable” and “less than worthless,” and said she knew she had to put the dog down. She then shot the dog.\nMy take: Cricket wasnotuntrainable.\nI want to do my part to make sure other dogs don’t suffer in a similar manner, and treating dogs well and fairly begins with knowledge. Just because Noem didn’t have the skills or education to train Cricket doesn’t mean she was untrainable. Nothing about her description of this dog’s behavior suggests that Cricket was unusual. Being overwhelmed with excitement, killing chickens, not listening to cues, biting someone who reaches for her, and generally being full of exuberance is all pretty typical behavior for a young dog put in the situations Noem describes.\nMy intent is not to pile on, but I can’t in good conscience keep to myself the thoughts I have about what happened. As a canine behaviorist and dog trainer specializing in working with dogs with serious behavioral problems, an important part of my work is educating people about dogs. Noem may think her behavior makes her look tough or paints her in a good light. After all, she chose to include it in the book meant to enhance her political resume, so she must consider this story about killing her dog something to campaign on.\nThe Trump VP contender is under fire for this heinous act of cruelty.\nDespite considerable backlash, she has vigorously defended her actions and has shared stories of killing other animals. In the book, she describes a goat as nasty, mean, and smelling bad. She also shot the goat after she killed Cricket. And in her response to widespread criticism,she put out a statementasserting that killing animals on a farm is standard operating procedure and that she recently had to put down three horses her family has had for over 25 years.\nPeople were right to be incredibly upset.\nThat did nothing to allay people’s horror. Colleen O’Brien, senior vice president at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)really let looseon Noem, saying in part, “Noem obviously fails to understand the vital political concepts of education, cooperation, compromise, and compassion.”\nFollowing the outcry about her behavior, Noemwrote on X, “Whether running the ranch or in politics, I have never passed on my responsibilities to anyone else to handle. Even if it’s hard and painful. I followed the law and was being a responsible parent, dog owner, and neighbor. As I explained in the book, it wasn’t easy. But often the easy way isn’t the right way.”\nI disagree that it shows Noem’s leadership style in a good light. It’s not a display of her willingness to do tough things, but rather a display of her ignorance and cruelty. Shooting Cricket reveals her to be uninformed and prone to cruelty in a fit of anger. She is someone who has much to learn. I prefer people in charge to delegate, to seek advice from experts, and always to err on the side of kindness.\nFrom her own description of the situation, she reveals that she has no understanding of dogs, and she went right from 1) “I don’t like how this dog is acting” to 2) “I hate this dog,” to 3) “She’s bad and deserves to die,” to then 4) “I am going to kill her in an inhumane manner.” Cruelty and brutality aren’t traits worth bragging about ever, let alone when seeking public office.\nReputable trainers and experienced dog people don’t assume an untrained dog will know how to behave in the high-arousal situation of a hunt, or that a bird dog will know that hunting pheasants is a desirable behavior but hunting chickens is not. Those with knowledge of training know that successfully training a dog requires skills and information, notputting a shock collaron a young dog and throwing them into situations they haven’t been trained to handle.\nOffering fewer treats can actually be agoodthing.\nGov. Noem clearly didn’t have patience or compassion for her young dog.\nAs Joan Payton of the German Wirehaired Pointer Club of America noted, “That was a puppy that had no experience, obviously no training. If you know a minuscule amount about a bird dog, you don’t take a 14-month-old-out with trained adult dogs and expect them to perform. That's not how it works.” She went on to say that Cricket was still a “baby” — a dog who wouldn’t be physically mature until reaching the age of two years and not expected to be fully trained until somewhere in the range of three to five years old.\nSome fundamental principles of successful, humane dog training include teaching dogs what you want them to do and reinforcing the behavior you want them to perform in the future. It also involves setting dogs up for success by managing the environment to encourage the behavior you do want them to do and preventing them from being able to do what you don’t want them to do. Throughout a dog’s training, a skilled trainer avoids putting a dog in any situation they can’t handle as they expand the range of situations the dog is capable of handling.\nManaging expectations is critical for progress when training a dog. We don’t expect a puppy to stay for 10 minutes without training, and we don’t expect a hunting dog to contain their excitement when put in a hunting or hunting-like situation. Ryan Busse, a Democrat running for governor in Montana, criticized Noem,noting that“anyone who has ever owned a bird dog knows how disgusting, lazy and evil this is.”\nNoem displays a lack of understanding of dogs, dog behavior, bird dogs, hunting dogs, and behavioral development, as well as what training looks like. Her first response (her reflex action) was cruelty. Commenting on her tale is a chance to educate more people. There’s a better way to train. Behavioral euthanasia — which only occurs inincredibly rare behavior circumstanceswhere all other possibilities have been exhausted — must always be humane. Expressing hateful feelings without sympathy, empathy, or compassion are not admirable traits.\nPolitical columnist and television personalityMeghan McCain understandshow harshly Noem’s behavior will be judged because of how much people love dogs, posting: “You can recover from a lot of things in politics, change the narrative etc., — but not from killing a dog.”",

    "page_content": "Life is an adventure, and having someone to guide us through its challenges is a blessing. My mentor isPatricia (Trisha) McConnell, PhD, and she has taught me so much about everything related to my work — understanding canine body language, working with clients, keeping myself and others safe around aggressive dogs, running a business, writing books, and so much more. Trisha and I share a great love for both people and dogs (our two favorite species!) and I think pups deserve mentors every bit as much as humans do.\nDogs definitely benefit from having mentors — usually in the form of an older dog in the home who shows them the ropes, helps them learn, and teaches them so much. Mentoring is the informal sharing of knowledge, skills, and support by someone with greater wisdom and experience to someone with less wisdom and experience. Lucky are the dogs who are mentored by a wiser, more experienced dog. There are great benefits in a puppy or young pup having a mentor. They can learn from mentors, adjust more easily to new experiences, and receive comfort from them.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat can dogs learn from a dog mentor?\nOne of the best things a young dog can learn from an older dog is the concept of boundaries, socially speaking. Many older dogs will let an energetic youth know when enough is enough or that certain behaviors are not tolerated. For example, if a young dog is relentlessly leaping on an older dog, trying to get them to play when that older dog is done and having a rest, the senior of the two may offer guidance.\nI’ve seen an older dog put their paw on top of the younger dog, growl at them, or even place their own mouth over their muzzle. All of these actions by the older dog, if done gently and appropriately, tell the little tyke to knock it off. And the younger dogs generally learn that when an older dog is not responding to their attempts to play, they should go find something else to do and quit bothering them.\nA few things to consider before expanding your fam by four more paws.\nI cannot emphasize enough how important it is that this boundary setting by older dogs should be calm, fair, and measured. The idea is to teach (mentor!) the little one, not scare them or upset them. Setting boundaries helps young dogs learn what is allowed and what is not and helps them develop self control. This behavior also gives them valuable practice being frustrated about not always getting what they want and helps them develop good canine social skills.\nMany people swear their older dog helped house train their younger dog. By headingoutside to peeand poop, these older dogs are scent-marking the outdoors, including the yard, which helps puppies learn the location of the canine bathroom. The younger dogs may see their mentor going, too, though the odors are probably a critical part of the mentoring about where to go. Guiding a young puppy to the proper spot is a helpful lesson that should give people everywhere cause to be grateful.\nThere is a lot of controversy about whether dogs are capable of observational learning, but anecdotally, many people swear their dogs watch and learn when they pay attention to other dogs. It’s common for people to report saying “sit” and giving a treat to their older dog when they respond correctly, followed by the younger dog looking at the older dog, and then hesitatingly sitting as though considering, “Am I doing this right?”\nMentoring is also extremely helpful when teaching a new dog to come when called, though this can only happen if the older dog has a solid recall. If you call out, “Come!” and the older dog turns and runs toward you, the younger dog is likely to follow along, just because chasing is so natural for dogs, and younger dogs so often follow older ones around. If the older dog responds to this cue, the younger dog has a greater probability of heading in your direction than they would if they were alone. Then, when the dogs reach you, you can reinforce them both, which allows you to start building a strong reinforcement history with the younger pup. In this way, the mentor-dog plays a big role in guiding the younger dog to good behavior and solid training.\nSpeaking of play, it’s often far easier for a dog to learn to play from an older dog who mentors them than from a human, however playful and motivated that human may be. Teaching a dog to play can be a wonderful form of mentorship, especially for dogs who may have come from a bad situation and not had the opportunity to be joyfully playful and happy. Many puppies have learned how to play and enjoy life from the lessons of a mentor-dog.\n7 signs your pup and their pal have BFF potential.\nMentor-dogs teach their young charges a lot when it comes to communication. There’s just no getting around the fact that dogs “speak canine” as native speakers, and we humans must learn it as a foreign language. The daily interaction with another dog is a valuable type of mentorship for keeping those canine communication skills in order, and for learning them in the first place.\nHow does a young dog benefit from having an older dog mentor?\nIt’s a pretty shocking experience for dogs to go from being with their mother and their littermates to being placed in a totally different home away from them. Plus, they have to get to know  new people and maybe new dogs. And, for pups who are rehomed when they are past the young puppy stage, it’s just as shocking to land in a new family with so many adjustments required.\nMany dogs seem more comfortable during these transitions when there is another dog who is kind, patient, and friendly present. It’s not unusual for young dogs to act as though they feel very secure having such an older one present in their lives — a kind and loving mentor to show them the ropes.\nHaving another dog as a mentor may mean dogs are more relaxed and better able to settle down to rest and to sleep. A pup snuggling up against an older dog with a contented sigh and then drifting off is so touching. Observing such a moment ispracticallyenough of a reason to add another dog to your household. (Feel free to tell your partner I said so!)\nHaving a mentor is so helpful for fearful dogs, especially those from puppy mills or rescued from hoarding situations; these dogs are almost always more comfortable with dogs than with people. Any dog who has been around other dogs a lot but has limited experience with people will benefit from having a canine-mentor as a guide and friend in their new home.\nThere’s a lot more to it than sniffing each other’s butts.\nJust having an affable buddy may mimic some of the mentorship benefits of a truly stable dog who guides them. Joining a household with a dog can be especially beneficial to young and energetic dogs. Such dogs may get into trouble less with another dog around because of the extra exercise and stimulation of play, as well as other interactions, add to their feelings of contentment and minimizes the boredom that can make problems more likely. If a true mentor of a dog also becomes a dear friend, so much the better.\nWhat kind of dog makes the best mentors?\nNot just any individual can be a mentor. They are not all suited for success in this role. The origin of the concept of a mentor in the human world comes from ancient Greece. In Homer’s epic poemThe Odyssey, when Odysseus left to fight in the Trojan War, he asked a trusted family friend to watch over his son, Telemachus. He chose carefully, picking a man who has been described as a protective, supportive person. This man acted as a trusted advisor to Telemachus, providing wise counsel and guidance, and his name was Mentor.\nThe best dog mentors are outgoing, sociable, and agreeable. They enjoy interactions with both people and dogs and are comfortable with a wide variety of situations. They can handle the unexpected  and are able to deal with changes in their lives and to the routine. They are typically relaxed as they go through life, and have medium levels of energy — enough to be interactive and up for all kinds of activities including play, but not so peppy that they overwhelm those around them with relentless motion. Mentor-dogs need to be good at understanding other pups so they react appropriately to a new dog’s changing emotions.\nI’m certainly grateful for the guidance and the knowledge my mentor  has shared with me, and I wish the same good fortune for all people and for all dogs.",

    },
    "page_content": "I work with all kinds of dog issues in behavior and training from teaching basic skills like sit, stay, come, and high-five to dealing with dogs who have such a serious bite history that the family is wondering if they can keep them. I specialize in working with aggressive dogs, and I work exclusively with positive techniques, which often puzzles people. There is a common idea thatpositive methods workfor simple training goals but that “more powerful” techniques are necessary to change the behavior of dogs with tougher, more serious issues. By “more powerful,” people mean harsh styles of training that use punishment.\nI say again and again to people who express this view that I use positive techniques not just because they are the most kind and humane, but also because they are also the most effective. Many people are dubious, and I take great care to explain.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nLet me make my case here about why I use and advocate for the use of positive methods when working with all dogs, including those exhibiting aggression.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nPositive methods are powerful.\nBeing gentle, kind, and humane with positive methods is a powerful way — not a weak way — to influence the behavior of dogs. Positive reinforcement is at the core of positive dog training, and it works so well in all kinds of situations and for all kinds of individuals. The reinforcement (treat, toy, play, etc.) makes the desired behavior more likely, and it also changes the brain chemistry of the dog in a beneficial way. Furthermore, the anticipation of the reinforcement has an even bigger effect on the brain than actually receiving it. That means that as the dog learns the system and understands that a treat is coming, positive reinforcement becomes potentially even more powerful.\nPositive dog training is so much more than simply using positive reinforcement, though that is a huge part of it. By using this method of training, you’re helping to give dogs the tools they need to behave in an acceptable way when in a challenging situation, such as meeting a new person or dog. It is unkind to put dogs into situations they can’t handle, and it’s even more cruel to become upset with them when they inevitably exhibit undesirable behaviors.\nAn undervalued aspect of positive training involves adjusting the environment to make it harder for them to do the wrong thing and easier for them to do the right thing. When dogs do the right thing, their behavior is reinforced, which strengthens that behavior. Setting dogs up for success and reinforcing that success is a key part of positive training, and it adds to the power of the process.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nPositive methods have so many other advantages.\nIn addition to being powerful, positive training methods have lots of other advantages. They do not rely on fear or pain to influence behavior, and that allows the learning process to be an enjoyable activity you and your dog do together instead of unpleasant for both of you. Unlike other methods, positive methods are less stressful for dogs and better for their welfare.\nPositive techniques build relationships and strengthen bonds instead of compromising them because they are shared good experiences rather than scary or uncomfortable ones. Not only is that beneficial to your lives but also to the training itself. Good relationships have always been a central part of good, effective learning experiences.\nA fundamental training principle is that it is better to teach your dog what you want them to do rather than what you don’t want them to do. Punishing your dog for jumping on orbiting visitorsdoesn’t help your dog know what theyshouldbe doing in that context. It’s better and more effective to teach them to sit when greeting someone or to go get a toy and bring it to you for atug sessionwhen someone comes into the house. A useful way to remember to be positive and kind is to remind yourself a dog doesn’t need a correction to change their behavior, but they do needhelpto change it.\nDon’t let your new dogwalk you.\nSticking to positive methods with aggressive dogs is especially important.\nI believe strongly thatdogs with aggression and other behavior problems deserve our sympathy, as well as our kindness. Philosophically, I subscribe to the idea that dogs are notgivingme (or their pet parents) a hard time, they arehavinga hard time. I’m sympathetic to them, and I want to be kind to them always. That is never truer than with aggressive dogs. The majority of aggressive dogs (80 percent of my cases, for example) are behaving aggressively primarily because they are afraid. If we want them to stop behaving aggressively, we need to help them conquer their fears. Being harsh in any with them is completely counterproductive to achieving that goal.\nFor example, imagine that a dog is afraid of new people, and every time they see a new person, they bark, growl, lunge, and bite if they are close enough. If you yell at them or punish them in any way, they learn that every time a person shows up, bad things happen to them (you getting upset with them is most definitely a bad thing!), which only makes them more afraid.\nIn contrast, suppose every new person they encountertosses them treats, something to chew on, or a new toy. If this is done correctly by paying attention to a lot of details — such as the distance between the person and the dog, the order in which the dog is exposed to particular people, and the situations you choose to put the dog in — the dog learns that people are the source of happiness via food, chews, and toys.\nThey learn to be happy when they see a new person because they have been classically conditioned to associate a new person with good things that make them happy. Classical conditioning is a very powerful type of learning, and it is a very effective way to change the behavior of aggressive dogs. It is a positive technique because when done correctly, the dog is only in situations in which they can cope, and over time the scope of situations they can handle is expanded. The undesirable behavior stops because the negative emotions at the root of the problem are being avoided.\nMaking sure the training environment is a happy rather than a scary one is critical to behavioral change, and that can only be done with positive methods, not by adding fear or pain to their life. Counterintuitively to many people’s opinion, using positive methods with aggressive dogs is effective, and harsh methods cannot be successful. In fact, because I so often want to change a dog’s emotions to stop their aggressive behavior, I use play a lot when working with aggressive dogs.\nPlay can be a reinforcement, a distraction, an incompatible behavior, arelationship-building opportunity, and a way to help a dog associate good feelings with a trigger that used to scare them. Play is so powerful and despite becoming more popular as a means of behavioral change, it is still underutilized in influencing canine behavior. Think of the difference in what a dog is learning if they were to be yelled at for barking and growling at a dog passing by the window (“I hate it when dogs go by!”) versus if they were to be offered achance to play tugevery time a dog walked by the window (“I love it when dogs go by!”).\nTake it slow. This process should never feel like speed-dating.\nPositive methods work even in tough cases.\nThere is still a common sentiment out there that positive reinforcement training is worth trying, but if you have areallyserious behavior problem on your hands (such as aggression) that it probably won’t work — that it’s not strong enough for such a big task. The truth is that positive methodsarepowerful and have a host of other advantages, and that is true no matter what you want to teach a dog and what behavioral challenges are the issue.\nPositive training is not just good for basic dog training and behavior. It’s superior in general, and it’s filled with advantages that are not only true when treating aggressive dogs, but — in some cases —especiallytrue when working with aggressive dogs.\nReferences:\nThe Eye of the Trainerby Ken Ramirez\nThe Eye of the Trainerby Ken Ramirez\nDon’t Shoot the Dogby Karen Pryor\nDon’t Shoot the Dogby Karen Pryor\nTrain Your Dog Positivelyby Victoria Stilwell\nTrain Your Dog Positivelyby Victoria Stilwell\nThe Midnight Dog Walkersby Annie Phenix\nThe Midnight Dog Walkersby Annie Phenix\nTreat Everyone Like a Dogby Karen B.

    "page_content": "Your puppy is ready to meet the world, and you are ready to make the introductions. It’sgo-time for socialization, which is the process of exposing a puppy to a variety of new experiences during the critical period of their lives from three to 14 weeks.\nDuring this window of their development, puppies are open to new experiences, and these new experiences have a big impact on their behavior and emotions. If they have opportunities to experience a variety of sights, smells, sounds, materials, and other living beings when they arein this stage, not only will they have an easier time accepting anything and anyone they become acquainted with, they will find new situations, experiences, and social partners easier to accept and enjoy throughout their lives. It sounds simple, but getting the details right can make a big difference in how successfully theirsocialization prepares themfor life.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nIt’s common to think of the two main parts of socialization as 1) meeting lots of new people of all kinds, and 2) meeting lots of new dogs of all types. But I maintain another way of dividing socialization into two categories: There’s the part of socialization that’sinteractiveand the part of socialization that’sobservational.\nThose little razor teeth are no fun.\nInteractive puppy socialization\nThe interactive part of puppy socialization is the part of socialization that most people focus on. This is about meeting other individuals, especially people and dogs. The goal is to organize interactions for your dog with people and dogs in a way so that each experience is a positive one. That means carefully choosing the individuals your dog interacts with and controlling the type of interaction your puppy has with them.\nIf your dog meets people who offer them treats, play with them in a way they enjoy, and handle them only in a gentle manner, your dog is likely to have positive feelings about people in general going forward. The same goes fordog introductionsin that you make it likely that your dog will feel good about dogs in general if the ones they meet during their socialization period are gentle, polite, fun, and appropriately responsive to your dog.\nIf, however, your puppy meets people who pick them up by surprise, talk too loud, charge at them with too much enthusiasm, or in any other wayfrighten or overwhelmthem, that’s not proper socialization. Similarly, if your puppy meets dogs who plow into them, roll them over, threaten them, or are just too exuberant in general, your puppy will not develop positive associations about dogs. It’s essential that you avoid allowing your puppy to become scared or upset in the name of socialization because that will have the exact opposite effect of what you intend.\nYour puppy needs good experiences with people and dogs, not just any old experience. Ideally the good experiences would be with people of different genders, sizes, races, ages, tones of voices and styles. They should meet people in wheelchairs and using canes, people wearing hats, people sporting beards, people who sing and dance, people delivering items to your home, and people who do handstands. They should meet dogs of all ages, sizes, breeds, and colors.\nIt’s a good idea to have your dog interact with other species as well, especially if they will be sharing a home with them. Other common species besides people and dogs that dogs live with in their home are cats, ferrets, and pot-bellied pigs. They may also have contact with farm animals, such as sheep, goats, cows, and horses, in which case their socialization should include pleasant interactions with members of these species, too.\nWhat’s key in interactive socialization is that the dogs learn that meeting new individuals is positive and that such individuals of various species are to be trusted. Meetings for interaction should be controlled and planned. They should be puppy-centric, meaning that they continue if the puppy is having a good time, but they cease immediately if the puppy is not. That requires pet parents to know how to read canine body language so they can assess their puppy’s emotional state.\nThese requirements cannot be met at the dog park or in huge crowds, so such places should be avoided. I am going to be very direct in order to be clear because it’s so important: just no, never, to socialization at the dog park.\nEverything you need to know to get your new addition off to a good start.\nObservational puppy socialization\nPuppy socialization also includes exposure in a positive way to all kinds of sounds, sights, smells, and things to touch. A puppy will grow up to be able to handle the world better if they are gently exposed to sounds of the world, such as loud trucks, the kitchen mixer, the dishwasher, the garage door, and phone alerts in a positive way — paired with treats and your loving support.\nSimilarly, they benefit if they smell new soaps, vanilla, cleaning supplies, coffee, cedar, firewood, and the scent of anything else they will encounter in daily life. They should see animals who will not be their buddies such as birds, squirrels, and rabbits.\nYour puppy should also feel a variety of substrates and get used to walking on them. Because dogs walk directly on surfaces, it’s important they feel comfortable on them so they don’t avoid them later in life. Puppies should have the opportunity to have play sessions, receive treats, and be gently pet in pleasant ways when they are on carpet, grass, gravel, stone walkways, concrete, asphalt, tile and wood floors, bark chips, and other surfaces present in your area.\nThey shouldspend time in a crate, go bycar to new places, and ride an elevator. They shouldsee bicycles, dogs behind fences, skateboards, strollers, traffic lights, and puddles. Going to new places, smelling and hearing new things, and walking on new substrates should all be experiences that are positive ones for them.\nIt’s this type of socialization that is not as well-known, because it’s not about interacting socially with others in the environment but about observing the environment. They are experiencing aspects of the environment without interacting with it. (Walking on various surfaces could be considered interactive in the sense that the puppy has physical contract with the ground. I have put it in the observational category, because it is a sensory experience for the puppy rather than a social one. I am using interactive in the social sense.)\nAs always with socialization, it’s essential that experiences be positive and that you take breaks as needed, depending on your puppy’s emotional state. Brief exposures are easier to keep positive, so expose your puppy to something and associate the experience with good things, and then move on.\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nMisunderstandings about socialization\nThere has been a lot of confusion about socialization, and one reason is the persistent myth that socialization is about exposing your puppy to as many dogs, people, and experiences as possible. The idea that your puppy must meet 200 people as soon as they come home has done a lot of damage; good socialization is all about quality, not quantity. The goal is for your puppy to meet people and dogs and havegoodexperiences, not to go through the meet-and-greet equivalent of speed dating.\nAnother reason for the confusion about socialization is that the word “socialization” connotes social interaction, but that is onlypartof socialization — the interactive part. It leaves out a huge part of the process — the observational aspect. So, the problem is a linguistic one. Ahh, isn’t English fun?\nThese apparent canine meccas can pose real risks to your dog’s overall safety.\nComprehensive puppy socialization for your new best friend\nLet’s review. When socializing a puppy, keep in mind these two components of the process: 1) Interactive: A dog who is comfortable in their world is able to interact with a variety of social partners including new acquaintances, and 2) Observational: A dog who is comfortable in their world is able to casually deal with or even ignore a variety of types of stimulation because they are used to a large number of sensory experiences.\nA puppy who is properly socialized will have an easier, happier life, and we as their pet parents are more likely to enjoy them and their behavior. It’s easier to lead your puppy toward a lifetime of the behavior you want if you consider puppy socialization more broadly.\nIdeal socialization involves exposure to the world with positive experiences as close to 100 percent of the time as possible. You want your puppy to learn about the world and know about what they will encounter throughout their life and how to  handle anything new.\nKnowing the proper way to socialize your puppy and being aware of the different aspects of the process as well as its goals will help you do right by your puppy.\nReferences:\nPuppy Socialization: What It Is and How to Do It",

These sudden switches in behavior can give new pup parents whiplash — and make it next to impossible to get anything done when you’re constantly worried about what your pet is getting up to.\nPuppies will be puppies, but if you’re feeling exhausted with all the running around, you can learn how to calm down a puppy when theyget the zoomies(and hopefully get some relaxation time yourself).\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhy do puppies become overexcited?\nRemember that your puppy is new to the world, so everything is fascinating. Of course, they want to explore! But if your puppy experiences too many new things in one day, they may become overstimulated, overwhelmed, or even overexcited.\nIn most cases, however,hyperactivity and overexcitementare a result of not enough mental stimulation, instead of too much. If your puppy feels bored, they may look for ways to keep entertained, which can be destructive, like chewing on furniture or other things they shouldn’t. Mental stimulation is essential for your puppy’s growth and development into a healthy adult dog. And while it may be exhausting when your puppy gets the zoomies, eventually they will settle down as they become more accustomed to and comfortable with their surroundings.\nYour little cutie isgrowing up in many ways—look out for these big stages as they do.\nThere are a number of things that can trigger a puppy’s excitement and result in a case of the zoomies, including:\nTiredness: Puppies need anywhere from 16 to 18 hours of sleep each day, so not getting enough sleep can make them overexcited — and make you both irritable.\nTiredness: Puppies need anywhere from 16 to 18 hours of sleep each day, so not getting enough sleep can make them overexcited — and make you both irritable.\nStress or anxiety: Some puppies may react to stressful situations with excitability.\nStress or anxiety: Some puppies may react to stressful situations with excitability.\nNew situations: For a puppy, almost every situation is new!

Being in new places and experiencing new things can be exciting, especially if the humans around them keep things positive.”\nIt’s likeWhat to Expect When You’re Expecting, except add“four little paws to run around your house”to the title.\nHow can I tell if my puppy is overexcited?\nSo, how do you know if your puppy is overexcited? There are plenty of signs:\nZoomies, also known as frenetic random activity periods (FRAPs)\nZoomies, also known as frenetic random activity periods (FRAPs)\nNipping or biting\nNipping or biting\nVocalizing (whining, barking)\nVocalizing (whining, barking)\nSpinning in circles\nSpinning in circles\nJumping or leaping\nJumping or leaping\nFrantic tail wagging\nFrantic tail wagging\nInability to sit still or relax\nInability to sit still or relax\n“I often advise clients to assess the amount of interaction and play that the puppy has had,” Fulton says. “If they’ve recently experienced a lot of activity (relative to their usual routine), but they’re still going 60 miles an hour, they’re likely overexcited and in need of some quiet play or chewing.”\nThose little razor teeth are no fun.\nHow to calm a puppy down\nYou know your puppy is overexcited, but how can you get them to calm down? Before you break out the puppy calming treats and start googling “puppy calming music,” identify what, if anything, triggers your puppy’s bursts of energy and excitement. Think about the times when your puppy got the zoomies and whether there was anything that set them off. Once you know the triggers, you can learn when to expect a bout of excitement and redirect all that energy to a more positive activity.\nPuppies thrive onstructure and consistency, which can help them adopt good behaviors that they will carry into adulthood. Make sure you have a regular schedule for your puppy’s mealtimes, potty breaks, and bedtime, so they can grow more easily adjusted to their new life in your home.\nWhether going for a walk or playing a round of fetch, exercise can help your puppy stay physically and mentally stimulated. Plus, a little playtime can be an excellent bonding activity for you and your pup — with the added benefit of leaving them worn out afterward.\nIf you’re looking for a safe and productive method for how to calm a hyper puppy, consider redirection. Redirect that excited energy with a puzzle toy or hidden treats in a Kong. You can also provide your puppy with chew toys to help discourage destructive and inappropriate chewing.\n“I recommendoffering your pupa lick mat, Kong, snuffle mat, or chew,” Fulton says. “Check with your veterinarian for chews that they consider safe for your puppy. Encourage your puppy to lie beside you with one of these items. Chewing and licking are more sedentary activities that require focus.”\nMusic can be therapeutic for dogs, just as it is for humans. Research has shown thatauditory enrichmentcan help reduce canine stress. Paired with other strategies, music can be an excellent strategy for how to calm down a puppy at night or even during the day.\nThe more you reward a behavior, the more often it will happen, so make sure toreward your puppywhen they’re exhibiting calm behavior or engaging in an appropriate activity.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nAt what age do puppies calm down?\nThe question most new pup parents want the answer to is: When do puppies calm down? Dogs tend to mature emotionally as they age. By taking the time to properly socialize andtrain your puppy, you can help them learn how to safely explore the world and not feel so overwhelmed by new experiences.\nOK, but what age do puppies calm down? While puppy energy will certainly diminish over time, it’s more important to invest indog trainingand social skills to teach your puppy appropriate dog behavior.\nAdditional tips to help calm a puppy down\nHelping your puppy to calm down when they have a burst of excitement isn’t easy, but with patience and persistence, you can help teach them appropriate behaviors. Here are a few more tips for how to calm a puppy down:\nRemain calm. If you get excited, too, your puppy will think it’s OK to act excited.\nRemain calm.

Supplements like melatonin or products with CBD may also help your dog feel more calm.\nHemp and other calming ingredients are safe for puppies to ingest, but it’s always a good idea to talk to your vet about what they recommend to help your puppy calm down.\nIf your puppy bites when they’re excited, redirect their attention to an appropriate activity, like a chew toy. Always stop playing when your puppy bites to let them know that this behavior puts an end to fun.\nAfter puppies are spayed or neutered, you may notice a decrease in aggression, thanks to lower hormone levels. However, spaying or neutering won’t change your dog’s behavior — that requires training.\nReferences:\nAn Introduction to Developmental Problems in Puppy Hood\nAn Introduction to Developmental Problems in Puppy Hood\nEarly Puppy Behavior\nEarly Puppy Behavior\nProducing Emotionally Robust Puppies, Part 1.

    "page_content": "During the pandemic, lots of people not only adopted pets, but also spent exponentially more time with the ones they already had. This resulted in stronger bonds and some pretty next-level pet-related hobbies. The most elaborate of them all? Teaching your pet how to communicate using a variety ofpush buttons.\nBunny, aSheepadoodle sensation on TikTok, is probably the most recognizable dog who pushes buttons to communicate, garnering millions of views around the world. In one video, you can see Bunny press them to express her “mad” feelings about baths. In another, she alerts her mom to an “ouch” in her ear. She even got existential by showcasing her ability to recognize herself in a mirror,dreaming of more rain, and questioning whether her new brother (a dog named Otter) was a human or a dog.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nCan dogs actually communicate with buttons? While your dog may not become as fluent in communicating with buttons as Bunny and other social media-famous pets, you can still teach your dog to “talk” to you and express their feelings.\nIn case you were wondering how Bunny feels about baths.#maddog#TikTokGGT#cutedog#funnydog#pronouns#foryou#talkingdog\nHow do dog communication buttons work?\nDog buttons for communication are a form ofaugmentative interspecies communication(AIC) device, which means that these buttons enable humans to communicate with other species. They are designed to help dogs (and cats) express their wants, needs, and feelings, and even ask questions about their environment.\nThese are recordable, allowing you to record words and phrases in your own voice. These phrases can include everything from simple concepts like “outside” to expressions like “love you!” Dogs learn to associate the button and the word it says with a specific outcome, allowing them to“speak” to their human parents.\nHow to train your dog to use communication buttons\nTeaching your dog to “talk” may sound challenging, but dog communication button training is possible with patience and commitment. Start with just a few words and work on getting your dog to hit the button andunderstand what the words mean.\n“I like to use a process called Shaping, where you pick a specific goal and reward the dog for successive approximations toward that goal,” dog trainerElizabeth H. “Kizz” Robinsonsays.\nMake sure to praise your dog when they press the button, but try to avoid using treats; this can give the wrong impression. Your dog may begin to think that pressing the button means getting a treat, instead of learning that they’re communicating their needs or feelings.\nWhen you’re starting out, you should use the buttons when appropriate to show your dog the right context and meaning for each word. For example, when your dog picks up a toy, press the “play” button. Instead of devoting a specific time each day to button training, simply use the words whenever they’re applicable.\nYour dog won’t understand what the buttons mean at first, so it’s important to respond to them any time they press a button or just sniff around it. If they nudge the “outside” button but don’t press it, press the button for them and open the door and let them outside to demonstrate what the button means.\nAs with any type of training, it’s important to be patient when using dog communication buttons. Observe your dog and pay attention to how they learn. Once your dog understands the meaning of the button (i.e., when they push the button, something specific happens), it will become easier for them to learn more words. Make sure to add vocabulary that can be used in a variety of activities and is relevant to your dog’s daily life.\nDon’t be afraid to tell your dog “no” when they press a button too frequently — or to say no to requests. But keep in mind that your dog needs to see a result to understand how the buttons work.\n“Any action that is rewarded is likely to be repeated,” Robinson says. “To teach the dog what the buttons mean, we have to reliably provide them with the thing that’s associated with the button. If we only provide the thing occasionally, then we might devalue the button and the dog will stop pressing it…One thing I like folks to keep in mind, though, is that, if we’re more generous from the get-go, then ‘too much’ may fade into ‘just right.’” When your dog is able to have something all the time, like a treat when they press the button, they may lose interest eventually and ask for it less.\nWhat to know before getting dog communication buttons\nThe best communication buttons for dogs usually come with a mat to keep them all in place, making it easy for your pet to press them. Some buttons come with pre-recorded words — usually common choices like “outside” or “play” — while others allow pet parents to record their own words.\nIt’s best to start with just one to three buttons and use words that your dog most likely hears often. Once your dog understands how to use the buttons and what their current words refer to, you can slowly expand their vocabulary, adding more to express additional thoughts and needs.\nCan dogs really communicate with buttons?\nOK, but do dog communication buttons work? Dogs communicating with buttons is more than a social media phenomenon — it’s a way for pet parents to better understand their dogs, and fordogs to communicate their wants and needs. However, your dog won’t learn how to communicate like TikTok sensation Bunny overnight. Teaching your dog how to use communication buttons takes time and patience — and a lot of both. And even once your dog uses buttons, you can’t be certain that they know exactly what they’re doing.\n“If we teach a dog to press a button before we take them out to pee, we tend to think that we’re teaching the dog to tell us they need to pee,” Robinson says. “The dog is probably learning that, if they press the button, we will take them outside. If the dog likes going outside, then they might press it whether they need to pee or not!”\nIt’s also important to understand that every dog is different — and learns at a different pace. So someone else’s experience on social media may be dissimilar to yours depending on your pet’s age, breed, orgeneral disposition to learning. The benefits of teaching your pet how to communicate are numerous and will undoubtedly improve their quality of life. Your dog could let you know when they need their water bowl refilled or when they have a preference in which type of game they want to play beyond justwhining or growling.\n“I ask folks to really think about what they want the dog to learn, and then we break it down together to make sure that we’re being very clear,” Robinson says. “Things like giving a Kong, playing tug, or even petting are much simpler, clearer ways to start with your dog because we can train them so that we associate one single thing directly with the button. If those go well and you find them useful, then we can work on how to make more complex associations and do some data gathering about whether those complex associations actually work for dogs and mean what we think they mean.”\nIt’s not just obsessive pet parents who are getting into pet communication. Even scientists are dialing things up, thanks in part to an increased number of pet parents who are volunteering forscientific research. Studies have found thatdogs are similar to human childrenin their sensitivity to human language, which likely isn’t a big surprise for pet parents who treat their canines like members of the family.\n“From a scientific point of view, if we said this 40 years ago, people would think us crazy. We had no reason to believe [that pets could communicate with us],” saysDr. Federico Rossano, director at Comparative Cognition Lab at University of California San Diego. “But in 2020, we have enough scientific evidence that says dogs are better at understanding communication signals from humans than chimpanzees.”\nDr. Rossano leads a project that includes Bunny and other social media-famous animals (although he notes that he’s not following all of their accounts closely and has a different methodology for studying animals’ cognitive progress). “If all there was out there was Bunny, I wouldn’t be doing this study,” he says. “The reality is that there are many other dogs nobody has ever heard of who are doing things that are similar to what Bunny has been doing.”\nThese days, Dr. Rossano’s team is studying and tracking the process of thousands of participants in 47 countries, learning how dogs can communicate with their human parents.\nCommunication button use cases\nUsing buttons for dogs to communicate can enrich the lives of both you and your pet. By working together on communication, you can better understand what your dog wants and needs andhow to communicate with your pup, reducing frustration for both of you.\nMany pet parents using dog buttons for communication have been inspired by the experience of San Diego-based speech pathologistChristina Hunger, who shares her methods on social media asHunger4Wordsand published a book on the subject calledHow Stella Learned to Talk: The Groundbreaking Story of the World’s First Talking Dog.\nRosa Maglione, dog mom toPiper, is just one pet parent inspired by Hunger. “I watched her videos and was curious about how she was able to teach her dog words,” she says. “I wanted to try it myself, so I got a hold of some answer buzzers.” Piper started out with one to three buttons and has now progressed to more than 47 in a year.\nIf you want some inspiration, there are plenty of social accounts dedicated to dogs that push buttons to communicate, from Bunny the Dog to the fast learnerParkerand ablind cat called Jasper. The websiteTheyCanTalk.orgis a good place to start. Countless pet parents who are experimenting with teaching pets how to communicate in new ways see themselves as pioneers in reaching a new era ofunderstanding companion animals’ cognitive abilities. “[Pet parents] know their animal better than anybody else,” Dr. Rossano says. “So they might be able to teach them things at home that would be impossible to teach in a lab because it would be an unfamiliar environment.”\nOf course, not all animal performances you see on social media can be taken at face value. Scientists apply different tests to be able to track and study animals’ cognitive abilities in an unbiased way. “Many scientists are not convinced that pets have a full understanding of what they’re asking for when they press the buttons,” Dr Rossano explains. “That’s the first thing we need to prove.”\nWant to get your and yours in on the trend? While research is still in progress, you can join one of the ongoing studies. Or you can get started with a small kit and then expand as your pet learns more and more words. Some pet owners have even built their owndog computer.\nFromclicker trainingtounderstanding gestures, we all know dogs are smart, but communication buttons can help demonstrate just how smart your canine pal really is.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nYes! For dogs, communication with buttons is possible, but it takes patience and time for a dog to learn how to use them.\nWhileresearch suggeststhat the average dog can learn about 89 words, some dogs have learned far more. One dog even learnedover 1,000 words.\nIf you’re just starting out with dog communication buttons, try theHunger for Words kit. Another popular option for dog communication button training is theFluent pet kit.\nReferences:\nCanine Co-Design: Investigating Buttons as an Input Modality for Dogs\nCanine Co-Design: Investigating Buttons as an Input Modality for Dogs\nTheyCanTalk.org\nTheyCanTalk.org\nEarly-Emerging and Highly Heritable Sensitivity to Human Communication in Dogs\nEarly-Emerging and Highly Heritable Sensitivity to Human Communication in Dogs\nBorder Collie Comprehends Object Names as Verbal Referents\nBorder Collie Comprehends Object Names as Verbal Referents",

But in order to do so, they needed tomake their half-acre property safe.\nHaving previously suffered through their local association’s laborious design-review process when they planned to build an addition to their Northern Virginia home, Teasley didn’t want to revisit the process to build a fence.

Keep reading to find out why you should find other, positive methods of training your dog.\nOffering fewer treats can actually be agoodthing.\nWhat is an electric fence?\nAn electric fence for dogs, sometimes called an “invisible fence,” is meant to keep dogs within bounds using a wire buried in the ground, a transmitting box, and a collar. When the dog gets close to the wire, the collar gives a beep, a vibration, or a shock. They are not considered part of apositive-reinforcement training routine and should be avoided.\n“Electric fences and shock collars are similar in that they give the dog an electrical shock, seemingly out of nowhere,” says dog trainer and breederTommy Wyldeof Floofmania. “The shock is painful and very sudden. Using this method will create fear in a dog, making them fearful of doing the seemingly ‘wrong’ actions, rather than making them happy to behave and please their humans.”\nAre electric fences cruel or safe?\nElectric fences cannot be called safe because of the emotional harm they could cause to a dog. Today, many pet parents in the U.S. are making the same choice the Teasleys did, as an increasing number of homeowners’ associations, as well as cities and counties, are putting restrictions on the types of fencing allowed — physical and electronic alike — and where they can be built.\nBut (and this is a big but), there’s a pretty strong argument to be made about the safety and efficacy of these systems. Many pet parents would rightly like toban shock collars, which would effectively end the use of electronic fences. Shock collars are already illegal in a number of other countries, including Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Slovenia, Switzerland, Germany, Portugal, and Wales, the Canadian province of Quebec, and in some states in Australia.\n10 steps to a safe outdoor space.

Remember,painandfear thresholdlevels are different for each animal, just as they are for each person.\nSome dogs are motivated to stay put, but some dogs become so afraid of the shocks that they won’t go out in the yard at all, and some dogs don’t care a bit and fly through the shock. Case in point: the Teasleys ended up scrapping their electronic fence about two weeks after it was installed, because Sheba ran and hid upstairs when the collar was put on her and Noodles just trotted through the “barrier,” ignoring the shocks.\nBeyond the system not working out, any time a dog feels pain or is hurt, there’s a risk of fallout behaviors developing, says Niki Tudge, certified dog trainer and behavior consultant and president of thePet Professional Guild. “What happens is that dogs start to generalize the pain to what they see and hear around them,” she says. “Then you end up with dogs who becomereactive and aggressivetowards children going past on bikes or people walking by.”\nFor this reason, cities like Overland Park, Kansas, stipulate that electronic fences cannot be used in front yards, and they have to be at least 10 feet from public walkways or neighboring property lines. Council Bluffs, Iowa, goes even further: Not only can the system not be used in the front yard, but the owner must be with the dog when the dog is outside.\nDo electric fences even work?\nNo, don’t count on it. Pet parents should keep in mind that electronic fences are not actually fences. No physical barrier secures a dog inside the perimeter or keeps other animals or people out. “Generally speaking, the electronic containment system is something that is an illusion of containment,” says Kenneth Phillips, an attorney who specializes in dog-bite cases.\nIn fact, “electronic containment systems usually are not considered to be any type of boundary fence as required by the ordinances of various cities and counties all over the country,” Phillips says. Municipalities that do include information on electronic fences generally state that they cannot be used for any dog with a history of aggression.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nNot having a physical fence in place can spell danger, not only for people and animals passing by, but also for the dog in the yard. In December 2015, McCann — who has led many Greyhound search-and-rescue missions — got a call from his veterinarian to help find Dimitri, her 15-year-old Terrier mix. Dimitri was out in his yard with his two siblings when a coyote entered the yard and dragged him away. McCann grabbed his infrared camera andset out to look for Dimitri; after more than an hour, the search party found the little black pup gravely injured a couple of hundred yards from his home. He died two days later.\nGiven accounts such as these, as well as the basic question of whether it is ever OK to use pain or fear to train a dog, it’s unsurprising that the collars are banned in other countries. While groups, including the Pet Professional Guild, lobby to ban shock collars in the U.S. some rescue organizations will notadopt any dogto a home that uses an electronic fence. So though it may be time-consuming, it’s best to put up an old-fashioned, red-tape-lined fence and keep an eye on your dog when they’re outdoors.\nNote: If you have a deaf puppy, talk to a trainer who specializes in training dogs who are not able to hear recalls about a safe, positive way to train them, such as a“watch me”cue or a vibrating,no-shock collar(never to be used for correction, only to get their attention).Deaf Dogs Rockis a great resource for learning about and training deaf pups.\nSetting up an electric fence for dogs\nInstalling an underground fence for dogs is a fairly intensive procedure. If you’re going to do it, you’ll need to install a transmitter underground, determine a boundary and dig a small trench, connect the wires, test the collar, and ground the system.\nBut do you really want to do all that for something that’s not good for your dog? An invisible electric fence isn’t worth it, according to experts. “Using pain as a ‘motivator’ really isn’t recommended by anyone anymore,” Wylde says. ”It’s cruel, and it runs the risk of making the dog anxious and stressed. Dogs can even become aggressive, mistrusting, and unpredictable.”\nCan I install an electric fence myself?\nA do-it-yourself electric dog fence is a bad idea for multiple reasons, not least of all that you might hurt yourself while trying to install it. Even if you manage to do it successfully, once it’s functioning, your dog is the one who’s likely to get hurt.\n“These electric devices, often considered ‘convenient solutions’ for pet containment and training, pose significant risks to a dog’s physical and psychological health,” says Dr.Sabrina Kong, a veterinarian with extensive experience in both clinical practice and animal behavior. “Electric fences can cause stress, anxiety, and confusion. Dogs may learn to associate the shock with the area around the boundary or even passersby, potentially leading to fearfulness or aggression.”\nElectric fence alternatives\n“Physical barriers, such as traditional fencing, provide a visible and safe containment solution without the adverse effects of electric shocks,” Kong says. But what should a loving dog parent do if, like the Teasleys, they want to let their dog play outside but can’t buildan actual fence?\n“Pretty much anything else you can think of will be better than using pain,” Wylde says. “Today’s dog training world is all about positive reinforcement. You reward positive behavior and simply ignore undesirable behavior rather than punishing the dog. This not only works better, but also keeps the dog happy, and willing to follow your instructions because they’re fun instead of being fearful of consequences.”\n“There are many safer and more humane dog containment and training methods, such as traditional fencing, training and positive reinforcement techniques, and even GPS tracking collars,” says Aaron Rice, a dog trainer and founder ofStayyy. “By embracing these alternatives, pet owners can ensure their dogs are happy, healthy, and well cared for.”\n(If your dogwon’t come when calledand you feel like you’ve tried everything, try working with a trainer who can help you figure out some new strategies to keep your dog safe.)\nFAQs (People also ask):\nAs stated above, electric fences are dangerous and should be avoided for any dog, regardless of size.\n“Positive reinforcement training methods, which reward desired behaviors, offer a compassionate and practical approach to teaching boundaries and obedience,” Kong says. “Leash training and supervised outings also ensure safety while allowing dogs the joy of exploration and exercise under the watchful eyes of their owners. Pet owners should use more humane and constructive strategies to provide their dogs with well-being while maintaining a loving and trusting relationship.”\nAn above-ground electric fence for dogs is just what it sounds like: An electric fence that isn’t installed underground. However, they work the same way — by causing pain to your dog to get them to behave in a desired way. Electric fences, whether above ground or below, are risky for all the reasons listed above. Don’t get one; your sweet pup deserves more.\nReferences:\nHow Much Does It Cost to Install An Electric Fence?\nHow Much Does It Cost to Install An Electric Fence?\nRecall Training for Deaf Dogs\nRecall Training for Deaf Dogs\nVibration Collars for Deaf Dogs\nVibration Collars for Deaf Dogs",

    "page_content": "Last year, my husband and I adopted a small Terrier. Upon meeting her one dry April day, the name was obvious: Bonnie. She was so clearly and perfectly Bonnie.\nI wish that was the end of the story, but the name Bonnie presented an issue. We concluded Bonnie sounded a little too similar to her cousin’s name, Bobbie, and could be confusing at family events, so we tried different names in the first 72 hours she was under our care. We worried over this name. We wrung our hands over it. We discussed alternatives for days. Nothing we could come up with sounded quite as correct as Bonnie.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nSo it’s especially perplexing that at some point within six months of raising this puppy, Bonnie had become Barney. Then Barney became Barney Mcgillicutty. ThenBarney Rubble Trouble. Soon, Barney morphed into Barneth, or, formally — like if you wanted to address a wedding invitation to her — Barneth K. Abernathy. Sometimes she’s Barnyard; other times, she’s Bernice. Occasionally, depending on the day, the company, and her personality in that moment, she’s Bonchan, Cinnabon, Miss Priss, Little One, Little Rat, or Pig. My mother calls her Bonbon, which I think is strange. What kind of nickname is Bonbon?\nAt this point, besides a full-stop lobotomy, I don’t think there’s anything that can help my me and my husband. But occasionally, I wonder if we’re confusing the girl. Bonnie is very smart, and listens to us. When we make our demands of her, we try to use her given name to avoid any confusion, but we slip up a lot. What, I wondered, are all these names doing to my poor dog?\nWhat’s in a name?\nBefore we can articulate how the wrong name affects a dog, we have to establish the reason we give our dogs names in the first place. Dina Casellini, founder, owner, and principal trainer ofMindfulPupsin Brooklyn, New York, told me that names aren’t completely necessary to communicate with our pups.\nYour dog might not know your name. Don’t take offense; just play this game.\n“Some trainers just use commands,” Casellini says. “They don’t necessarily use the name.”\nYet, naming is a natural human impulse, and can be a useful one. Teaching a dog their name alsoteaches them to pay attention to you, Casellini adds, so you can carry out other cues. It’s among thefirst building blocks ofdog training. A dog’s name usually cues, “Eyes and ears on me.”\nWhen to call them by their name\nGiving a dog a good name foundation while training is especially essential for one very specific reason: emergency situations. In case of emergency, Casellini explains, you want the dog to have an immediate response to their name so you can quickly call them away from dangerous circumstances.\n“When it comes to any of the life-saving skills, we really want to make sure that we practice with clarity,” Casellini says. She recommends using the exact same name, command, and tone each time.\n“You have to rehearse multiple times, not just wait until the emergency moment to call upon that practice,” Casellini adds.\nLikewise, in a group-training space or multi-dog households, naming becomes a more crucial piece of the communication puzzle. “If we open the door, and we don't want six dogs to run through at the same time, we will ask the dogs to wait, we will open the door, and then we will call the designated dog [by name],” Casellini says.\nShe advises against naming dogs in a single household similar names to avoid confusion, but it’s not an insurmountable obstacle if a Bonnie and a Bobbie, for example, shared living space. In the event that she has, say, three “Lunas” in a class, she uses eye contact and body language to communicate which Luna she’s talking to.\nAlana Stevenson, a dog and cat behaviorist whotrains dogs across New England, likewise suggests avoiding similar-sounding names.\nSay What? A look at the types of words that dogs understand.\n“Most non-human animals have a sense of hearing that is far superior to ours,” Stevenson says. “Dogs with nearly identical names may eventually learn the nuances in your voice to differentiate between themselves, but when strangers or others say their names, they won’t have that same familiarity.” He purposely picks names that do not sound similar when he's choosing names for animals. “For multiple dogs, I pick a ‘group’ name to call all dogs and teach that to my clients,” he says.\nIt’s as much how you say it as what you say\nResearchers have begun to explore so-called “genius” dogs for whom language acquisition comes more naturally than others. Arecent studyshowed that some dogs are capable of learning words for their toys through a vocabulary acquisition test (VAT). While the study was not able to establish whether this was a product ofnature or nurture, the thing to remember is that there are dogs who are capable of learning names for various toys, commands, etc., and that bodes well for dog’s apprehending their various nicknames. Still, for most dogs, the accepted wisdom is that when you’re communicating with them, tone and body language matter as much, if not more, than a word itself.\nAs Stevenson puts it, “Most animals become comfortable with tones, noises, and sounds, not necessarily the word itself. So, if another person said the same word, most animals wouldn’t associate with it. Likewise, if someone is constantly yelling at the animal, repeating the animal's name over and over again as replacement for any interactions or redirections, then the animal will ignore what the person is saying.”\nIf you tend to recall a dog by saying their name in a high-pitched voice and clap, then they will infer that you want them to come. If you use the same tone and body language to call a dog who is officially named “Charlie,” let’s say, but shout, “Pizza,” or “Donkey,” or “Tony Soprano,” then Charlie will often still respond to the context clues you’ve offered.\nThink of a dog’s speech acquisition like your own. If you’re in a country where you don’t speak the language well, you’re going to learn to recognize a few words and pay more attention to body language than you would if you’re totally fluent.\nNickname to your heart’s content in most situations\nCassenili adds that a lot of what we say is just “white noise” to our pets. In training, usually the fewer words you use, including nicknames, the better. But outside of training, it matters less because they’re likely not paying that close attention to your literal words.\n“It’s a human thing to make nicknames. It’s fun,” Casenelli says. “We love to have fun with our dogs.” Outside of emergency situations, it’s fine to call a pup whatever comes to mind. “If [you’re] just giving cuddles from the other room, you can say whatever you want.”\nIn those moments, the pups probably won’t be confused. In fact, Bonnie-Barney-Bernice-Bonatron-Barneth-Cinnebon-Bonbon probably won’t register her nickname(s) at all.",

      "title": "Your Grumpy Dog Is Very Smart—Science Says So",
      "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/grumpy-dog-intelligence-study"
    },
    "page_content": "If we learn anything as we age out of the desire to leave the house after 10 p.m. or have a friend force last-minute plans upon us, it’s that being a grouch isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In short, embrace the crankiness — wisdom some of our pets have long been enjoying. In fact, in 2021, one study found that the grumpiest pups among us may also be the smartest.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nThe Hungarian studyexamined how quickly dogs can learn based on their temperament. “People usually look at the different behaviors of dogs as completely separate phenomena and handle them as such. While I think it is important to be able to identify behaviors separately, it is as important to see their connections,” says biologist and one of the study’s authors Kata Vékony.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nBefore starting the experiment, researchers issued a questionnaire to participating pet parents to gauge their dog’s behavior. Questions were not super obvious like, “Is your dog grumpy?” or “Is your dog cheerful?”. Instead, they enlisted a series of inquiries to effectively determine each dog’s vibe. This featured questions on how pups behaved when groomed or bathed, whether theybarkedat things or situations they don’t like, or if they’ve eversnapped at or bitother dogs or people. The team then used this information to assign each animal an “irritability” score.\nWhen your dog growls, they’re expressing their emotions. A study found that you’ll likely be able to understand what they’re feeling.\nHow the Grumpy-Dog Study Worked\nAtEötvös Loránd Universityin Budapest, Vékony and her colleagues essentially tried their best to tick off every dog by presenting a favoritetreator toy in plain sight behind a V-shaped wire mesh fence. Naturally, an animal’s instinct is to head straight for the thing they want, so the test was to see how quickly they’d learn to go around the fence. The dogs were divided into three groups, starting with one  that had figure their way around the V alone. After the designated 60-second timer was up, most didn’t make it to the prize. Next, the researchers watched a group of dogs attempt the pseudo maze with assistance from their parents. To Vékony’s shock, dogs categorized as agreeable and those holding the “grumpy” label performed equally well in these groups.\n“We initially thought that dogs with more ‘smooth’ relationships with their owner would learn better from them so it was a surprise that we found no difference between dogs in learning from the owner,” Vékony explains. But the true revelation came with the third group, which went through the experiment with guidance from a stranger. What the researchers found was that the grumpy canines were significantly more successful in completing the task, in comparison to those defined as cheerful.\nThis body language is not as simple as you probably think.\n“Interestingly, it turned out that dogs that are less tolerant to being bathed or groomed or not getting things their way, in general, are also the ones who are more persistent and goal-oriented,” Vékony says, before noting that this does not mean crabbier dogs are necessarily more intelligent.\nA Grumpy Dog Is a Socially Intelligent Dog\nGiven the parameters of the study, these findings only indicate that grouchy pups are more susceptible to social learning. As she explains, “It’s not intelligence overall or problem-solving ability but specifically social learning. These dogs are sensitive and not very tolerant of unpleasant or uncomfortable social situations so it is understandable that they pay more keen attention to the actions of humans around them. And attention is a key ingredient of social learning.”\nOf course, there are a few caveats to the results. Notably, the researchers didn’t consider breed in the study. Additionally, behavioral issues, such as human or animal aggression or separation anxiety, were not factored in. Vékony confirms that to include these components, they would have needed a much larger sample size.\nTurns out, theycanexperience pretty complex emotions.\nThat being said, there is plenty to take away from the study — namely that grumpy dogs are not less good or productive. Clearly, the research shows that cranky pups can be perfectly well-behaved. And as long as you’re not trying to make them wear colorful sweaters or hang with too many upbeat characters, they’ll listen and pick up training cues quickly. Ultimately, these dogs are just comfortable with their wants and dislikes. They’re happy to pursue the things they like and avoid what they don’t. It’s something we could probably continue to learn from them.\n“After the events of the past few years, I’m surprised most people still have some of their social skills left,” Vékony says. “But as a grumpy human of a grumpy dog, I can say that sometimes we should just embrace our grumpiness.”",

    },
    "page_content": "As all dog parents know, dogs come inmanyspectacular shapes, sizes and breeds, but according to a new study they only have five distinct personality types. The study published inScientific Reportstook a new approach to predicting and categorizing dog personalities, using an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to search through 70,000 behavioral records of dogs to find common threads running through the breeds.\nThe research was conducted over two years by Dr. Mohammad Amirhosseini of theUniversity of East London, Professor James Serpell of the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Veterinary Medicine, and the U.S. canine technology start-up Dogvatar, who sponsored the study.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nWhat are the five personality types in dogs?\nThe researchers found that all dogs could be classified into five groups: excitable/hyper-attached, anxious/fearful, aloof/predatory, reactive/assertive, or calm/agreeable. To discover their personality traits, dogs in the database were scored on behaviors, such as how they responded when unfamiliar people visited their home or if they were jealous when their parent gave affection to another animal.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nWhy is it important to understand your dog’s personality type?\nIn the U.S., nearly 50 percent of people who surrender dogs to animal rescue orgs cite behavioral problems as a contributory factor. The researchers hope that the study’s results could help foster stronger bonds between humans and their dogs, paving the way for more effective training programs and tailored pet-parent interaction.\nLead author of the study, Dr. Mohammad Amirhosseini, said that the research could assist with dog-human matchmaking, as well as suitability for becoming a working dog. “We believe that our findings could help dog training agencies more quickly and accurately assess which animals are likely to succeed long-term in careers, such as aiding law enforcement and assisting persons with disabilities. The results could also be used for helping shelters with proper placement, thus reducing the number of animals returned for not being a good fit with their adoptive families.”\nClinical animal behavioristEmily Birchsays that research into dogs’ personalities is not new; however, this new study could have a massive impact on understanding dog behavior.\n“As a behaviorist, I certainly see these personalities within consults, and the repercussions of this when dogs and owners are poorly matched. However, I always err on the side of caution when labeling individuals. There will be a wide scale within these personality types and an element of crossover. The data is also still relying primarily on pet owner reporting of behaviors, which can vary with environment and situation, and change over time, so this is something to be taken into account.”\nAdvancements in artificial intelligence are changing everything from the way we detect illnesses to how we keep our pets safe.\nPersonality type: excitable/hyper-attached\nThis personality type is characterized by relatively high levels of excitability, attachment/attention-seeking behavior,separation-related anxiety, and reduced fear compared with the other personality types.\nBirch says you’ll be able to spot an excitable/hyper-attached dog because they’re always busy and may have a little FOMO. “They get excited easily, take a long time to calm down, and are the life and soul of the party! They may be impulsive, thinking little about consequences before they act. They need to be with and around you and probably follow you on every toilet visit, in case they miss something exciting!”\nExcitable dogs need humans who can cope with their extra energy and neediness, and recognize that their dog won’t be happy being alone for extended periods.\nNumber 6 will probably surprise you.\nPersonality type: anxious/fearful\nAnxious/fearful dogs displayed relatively high fear of social (such as unfamiliar people and other dogs) and non-social events (new or unexpected situations). The anxious/fearful dog is cautious in disposition, thinking hard before doing things.\nBirch believes they could be anxious because of past trauma. “But their personality type might go some way to explain why some dogs can be attacked by other dogs and still be dog-friendly, or treated terribly by humans but still happy and confident around them; whilst other dogs can have the smallest of things happen, but take it really deeply and are highly traumatized by the event.”\nAnxious/fearful dogs are more likely to whine, jump up, or try to intervene when their parent strokes another animal, and they need patient parents willing to put in time to help them deal with fearful situations.\nPersonality type: aloof/predatory\nAloof/predatory dogs have lower levels of attachment/attention-seeking and higher levels of predatory behavior and aggression towards other dogs.\nThese dogs are notoriously hard to train, per Birch. “They will look at you when you call them, then trot off to carry on their own business. They’re happy in their own space and fiercely independent. They will happily go off hunting without a backwards glance and may even kill wildlife. They might give the illusion of being a bit dim but I assure you, they’re not.”\nParents of aloof/predatory pups must be consistent and find a way to motivate and reward a dog whose greatest joy is sniffing or chasing wildlife.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nPersonality type: reactive/assertive\nDogs who are reactive/assertive have heightened aggressive behavior across multiple domains, including aggression towards household members.Reactive dogstend to become aggressive when scolded or shouted at by their parents, and fearful of sudden loud noises, such as a vacuum cleaner being switched on or an object being dropped.\n“These dogs are on the offensive and know what they like and do not like,” Birch says. “Their traits may have been bred into working dogs over generations – if you’re a shepherding breed, you need to be aware of predators and not be scared of seeing them off when protecting your livestock.”\nWith a reactive dog, work to identify the specific triggers that set your dog off. A trigger acts as a stimulus to make your dog react dramatically. After identifying triggers, try to avoid them while you work on a training plan, which should be based on positive reinforcement and patience.\nPersonality type: calm/agreeable\nAccording to the research, calmer dogs were less likely to chase birds or cats than their counterparts and were quicker to learn new tricks or tasks. “They’re easy to live with, go with the flow and make great pets. They may not set the world on fire with their working ability, but they are worth their weight in gold,” Birch says.\nDue to their peaceful nature, Birch rarely meets these dogs in her practice. Calm dogs tend to beideal family dogsbecause they’re great around young children. Or, if you’re getting older and want a dog who can match your pace, a calm canine could be precisely what you’re looking for.\nHow can this research be applied in the future?\nDr Amirhosseini says: “We are still working on analyzing the potential relationship between human personality traits and these dog personality types. Personality type and behaviors are closely intertwined, so a key future outcome is understanding effective training techniques for a dog’s personality type. In theory, in the future rescue organizations and shelters could use a tool to understand both a dog’s personality and how good a fit it is for the right owner.”",

    "page_content": "Dogs essentially react in one of two ways to the sight of snow. First, we have those pups who fall somewhere between dramatic and anxious, like my own pup, who will avoid the elements at all costs. When faced with snow, rain, or occasionally a mild wind, my dog and many like her, effectivelygo on a potty strikeuntil the weather corporates with their demands. On the other hand, there are the fun-loving dogs who react to snowflakes beginning to fall with pure excitement, like a kid waking up on a school day after wearing their pajamas inside out. There areso many smellsto sniff!\nThese pups love nothing more than to run and jump around outside after a blizzard without a care in the world. The downside to this enthusiasm is that it can sometimes be difficult to get these animals to enjoy their winter wonderland in moderation. While no pet parent wants to interrupt their dog from having the time of their life, we sadly have other things to do beyond supervising our animals—and we get cold, too. Plus, it can be dangerous for them to be out there for too long. So, how do we limit their time in the snow without breaking their hearts?\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nAnd why you deserve a pat on the back for indulging them.\nWhywon’t your dog come inside from the snow?\nBefore curbing this behavior, we should first look at what’s inspiring it. Dr. Sabrina Kong, a veterinarian atWe Love Doodles, explains that much like people, dogs have diverse opinions on the necessity of colder seasons. “Dogs’ reactions to snow vary greatly, much like our responses to winter weather,” she says. Beyond individual preference, Kong adds that some breeds are naturally drawn to snow, such as Siberian Huskies or Bernese Mountain Dogs, due to their thick fur coats and historical presence in colder climates.\n“These breeds are genetically predisposed to thrive in colder weather, finding snow stimulating and enjoyable. On the other hand, dogs with thinner coats or those not genetically adapted to cold environments may dislike the cold and snow due to discomfort or difficulty maintaining their body heat,” Dr. Kong says.\nHere are some simple steps to pry your pup away from thatonespot in the yard they’re obsessed with.\nAnd breed doesn’t only play a role in your pup’s enjoyment of snow; it can also indicate the level of danger from their overexposure to it. Dr. Kong notes that breeds like Siberian Huskies or Bernese Mountain Dogs, with their huge P. Diddy-like fur coats, are at a far lower risk of cold-related health issues than say a Pug or Pittie, who have much thinner natural jackets.\nWhat are the biggest risks with your dog playing in the snow for too long?\nPer Dr. Kong, the largest concerns with these dogs arehypothermia or frostbite, particularly on sensitive areas like the nose, ears, and paw pads. That being said, she warns that once the temperature starts to drop below freezing, pretty much any dog is at some risk and should have their snow time limited. Look for shivering, lethargy, whining, or displaying any general discomfort as signs that your dog has been in the snow too long.\nAdditionally, Susan Nilson, trainer and founder ofThe Cat and Dog House, explains that the snow itself poses another sneaky threat to dogs who love to play in it. While these pups are running around, snow can get stuck between their toes before melting and forming sharp ice chips that poke the inner paw. This painful issue is especially common in dogs with longer hair around their paws and only elevates the frigid impact of the weather.\n“If you notice your dog holding up their paw during a snowy walk, this could be the reason. Obviously, snow is also extremely cold which may cause discomfort for some dogs, like a burning sensation in their paws,” she says.\nTeach your pup a perfect recall so you can be sure they will come back, no matter what.\nHow can you train your dog to come inside when it’s time?\nTo avoid these risks, Shane Gentry, trainer and founder ofSally Said So, recommends one tactic above all else. He says that training your dog to execute reliable recall is essential in getting them out of the snow, regardless of how much they’re enjoying the weather. “Recall is recall no matter the environment. It is one of those non-negotiable commands every dog should know. It can literally save your dog’s life,” he says.\nForrecall training newcomers, start indoors or in another enclosed space. Try to limit any distractions or excess stimuli and have your pup’s favorite treats handy. Then get their attention using their name or a verbal like “come” or “here” and reward them with a treat. Take a few steps away and run it back, increasing distance with every take. Repetition is key in for this training.\nSnow days are fun—until your pup needs to do their thing outside.\nDr. Kong agrees that proper recall training is crucial in getting dogs to hop out of the snow while recommending a couple of additional techniques, including using a long leash. This will help guide resistant dogs inside when they’re overstaying their wintry retreat. Establishing a routine of consistent outdoor excitement for your dog every day will also help set and manage expectations. Of course, this type of regular exercise and exploration will simply improve your dog’s physical and mental health in general.\n“Remember that providing outdoor playtime that’s physically and mentally engaging can help ensure your dog is satisfied and more willing to come inside after enjoying the snow,” Dr. Kong explains.\nIf all else fails, double down on the appeal of staying in and being a couch potato. Be sure to create awarm and cozy space indoors with lots of toys and treats, and your dog will a become a bratty homebody like mine in no time.",

Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nStudies suggest animals do think of us as their parents.\nBefore we go further, we’d like to reassure you — you are not in an unrequited relationship with your pet. Studies done on both dogs and catssuggest the bondbetween pets and their guardians actually mirrors, in some ways, the relationship between human children and their caretakers.\nA2015 studyshowed levels of oxytocin (sometimes referred to as the “love hormone”) rose in both dogs and their human caregivers when they gazed into each other’s eyes, or when the human engaged in petting the dog. Thissame mutual risein oxytocin is seen between parents and newborn children when gazing and touching, and helps build a bond between the two.\nYou love them like a child, but is the feeling mutual?\nAnd a2019 studyshowed that cats have distinct attachment styles to their human parents, comparable to those seen in child-parent attachment; this has alsobeen observedmany times instudiesbetweendogs and their caretakers. “In both dogs and cats, attachment to humans may represent an adaptation of the offspring-caretaker bond,” the study's lead author, animal behavior researcher Kristyn Vitale, saidin a press release. “Attachment is a biologically relevant behavior. Our study indicates that when cats live in a state of dependency with a human, that attachment behavior is flexible and the majority of cats use humans as a source of comfort.”\nThese are just a few examples from a growing area of study, so rest assured: You aren’t wrong to consider your pet a member of your family.\nDifferent parenting styles can lead to different behavioral outcomes in dogs.\n“Dog breeds can havebreed-specific behaviorsthat another breed would either be physically incapable of doing or would greatly struggle to learn how to do,” Lauren Brubaker, a dog behavioral researcher, tells Kinship. Still, she thinks personal history, which includes how they’re parented, has “the biggest influence on their behavior.”\nIn a2022 study, published in the journal Animal Cognition, Brubaker and researcher Monique Udellsurveyed dog parentsabout their parenting style; specifically, they asked about their expectations for their dogs, and how they typically respond to their dogs’ needs. The results placed them into categories similar to groups already established by those who study the relationship between human children and their parents: “authoritative” (meaning a style of parenting where high expectations are matched by a high responsiveness toward needs), “authoritarian” (where high expectations are met with low responsiveness), and “permissive” (where low expectations matched low responsiveness).\nWe asked both animal behaviorists and human psychologists howyoucan deal with leaving your dog home alone.\nTheir dogs underwent three behavioral tests, the first measuring their attachment to their human parent, the second testing their sociability, and the third monitoring their ability to get a treat from a puzzle toy with different levels of help from their parent. The results showed that each parenting style was associated with a different behavioral outcome.\n“Authoritative parenting, having high expectations while also being responsive to your dog’s needs can lead to measurable positive outcomes“including increased feelings of security, stress reliance, and problem solving persistence in dogs,” Udell says. These benefits, Udell adds, are similar to those experienced by human children with authoritative parents.\nDogs with authoritarian owners were more insecurely attached to their parents, and dogs with permissive owners were more likely to follow the social cues of a stranger than their parent; neither of these groups had success with the puzzle.\n“Some pet parents, for example those with a permissive parenting style, exhibit great warmth and understanding towards their dogs, but may overlook the importance of having high expectations,” Udell says. “In fact, having consistent realistic expectations and rules, engaging in reward-based training, and encouraging problem-solving are all important ways to help your dog build confidence, feel comfortable in their surroundings, and grow in their relationship with you.” The good news is, she says, it’s never too late to start building this deeper connection with your dog.\nWhich comes first: a nervous person or a nervous pup?\nCat behavior is also affected by their human.\nDogs aren’t the only ones being influenced by their human parents. A2019 studysurveyed cat parents about their personality and the health and behavior of their cats. The humans’ answers  weremapped onto a systemyou might be familiar with: the Big Five Inventory (BFI), which evaluates personality in terms of agreeableness, conscientiousness, extroversion, neuroticism, and openness. And — please don’t allow this to stress you out (it’s bad for your cat, apparently) — the study’s results showed a connection between parent personality and certain aspects of cats’ behavior and emotional health.\nIncreased agreeableness in humans, for example, correlated with friendlier and healthier cats. High conscientiousness was associated with cats displaying less anxious and avoidant behaviors, and high neuroticism scores correlated with increased incidence of stress-related illnesses in cats.\nLauren Finka, one of the study’s authors, previously spoke to Kinship about her findings. “This study really highlights the potential ways we as owners might impact the behavior and well-being of cats and the important role our personalities might play in relation to this,” Finka says. “Our findings closely mirror those identified within parent-child relationships, suggesting that, just like children, cats are very sensitive to and influenced by the ways we care for and interact with them.”\nOK, OK, don’t come for us. We know dogs and kids are very different to raise, but this study finds they respond to different parenting styles in similar ways.\nLike dogs, cats can also build confidence and reduce stress through positive reinforcement-based training with their parents. A visit to the vet is one of the most stressful situations for both cats and their humans  (and this stress can sometimes lead to parents avoidingregular vet visitsaltogether).\nIna 2018 study, published inApplied Animal Behaviour Science, scientists at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, Austria, 22 cats were split into two groups: half were trained, using their preferred treats, to use their cat carrier for a mock vet visit, half were not. Researchers observed the trained cats were less stressed and made it through their appointments more quickly than the untrained cats, showing that it’s possible to help your cat exist more confidently in the human world.\nDon’t stress if you think you’ve parented your pet “incorrectly.”\nBrubaker says pet parents shouldn’t worry too much about getting it wrong. “If I could tell pet parents one thing, it would be to love and enjoy your pet, have fun with them, and know that they love you unconditionally,” she tells Kinship. “If someone is looking to be a better pet parent, I recommend positive reinforcement training classes from a reputable trainer as a great place to start.”\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nOne way to think about training with positive reinforcement, Udell says, is that you’re teaching your pet how to have their needs met in a world where humans control most of the resources. “What we view as misbehavior is often due to a lack of understanding about how to get needs met,” she says. Positive reinforcement is focused on recognition of what your pet wants and needs, and it shows your pet “exactly what behavior is necessary to have a need met, when this outcome is possible (or not), and that you are a trusted source of help.”\nResearch has also shown, Brubaker says,that playis an important part of pet behavior and development. “Invest in somefun toysfor your dog or cat so you can play with them!” And finally, she says, make sure your pet gets an appropriate amount of exercise. Your cat might not be able to buy you a “World’s Best Mom” mug, but they will be able to exist a bit more confidently in the world. And what more does a pet parent need?\nReferences:\nSocial Evolution. Oxytocin-Gaze Positive Loop and the Coevolution of Human-Dog Bonds\nSocial Evolution.

    "page_content": "Puppies go through stages as they develop, behaving in predictable ways according to their age and developmental stage. Don’t take the age boundaries as absolute. There is variation among dogs, and these stages are gradual.\nUnderstanding these stages can help make raising a puppy easier and more fun because they eliminate a lot of uncertainty.  Consider these guidelines of puppy stages for what to do and what to expect, behaviorally speaking, at each stage of your puppy’s life.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nBirth to three Weeks\nPuppies are completely dependent on their mother for food, warmth, and cleanliness. They even need their mother’s assistance to help them go poop and pee. Their eyes are closed until the middle or end of the second week, they can’t yet see and hear, and they move very little.\nThey do make noises, though, with mewing and squeaking sounds common in newborns. A puppy separated from their mother will alert her to their predicament (danger of going hungry or getting cold) with contact calls. They scoot around in a paddling sort of way, pulling themselves with only their front paws as they cannot support their own weight.\nLet them be with their littermates and their mother constantly. They need to be together for care, food, and warmth. Keep their room warm and offer clean bedding for them, but otherwise let them be. Handling them takes them away from their heat source (their mom) and opportunities to feed as they nurse about every two hours in the newborn phase.\nIt’s likeWhat to Expect When You’re Expecting, except add“four little paws to run around your house”to the title.\nThree to eight weeks\nPuppies in this stage begin exploring. Their eyes are now open, and they can hear, too. These senses were beginning to work sometime in week two or three but are now more functional and influence their behavior more. During this stage, puppies move around on their own a lot and play with their littermates.\nAround week five or six, the way they play can look alarmingly rough. More than one person has feared they have a litter full of “aggressive” puppies, when that was not the case.\nContinue to let them be with their littermates and mother. It is critically important they are together; the puppies learn important lessons during their interactions that are very difficult to learn otherwise. They learn toinhibit their biteand how to start and end play with other dogs, as well as many other social skills, which is why puppies taken from their mother and littermates when they are only five or six weeks old (or even earlier, though that is less common), are more likely to be aggressive to other dogs. They are also at risk of biting too hard during play with other dogs and with people and to apply more pressure in an actual bite with either species as well.\nDuring this time, it’s good for people to handle them (but gently!). They should begin to meet all kinds of people — men, women, children, people of different races and genders, and those who move in different ways, including with a cane, a walker, or a wheelchair.\nAs you begin to teach them where the bathroom is, considerwherethey are doing their business. Puppies learn very early on, even at eight weeks, where to potty and are often loyal to that surface. So, if their guardian can find grass or dirt or leaves for them to use, that will make it easier to house train them later than if they go on carpet or on towels now.\nIf it’s time for a round of shots (no, not that kind), follow this guide.\nEight to 16 weeks\nIt’s during this period, usually at the very beginning, that dogs typically go to their new home, so it’s a time of transitions. A puppy might be a little bit different for the first few days to a week or so in your home because they are adjusting. Some dogs don’t act differently after a brief time settling in, so don’t be surprised either way.\nMany dogs go through a bit of a fear period in the early weeks of this stage, so your puppy’s confidence will experience a slump and then grow as this stage progresses. In the early weeks, your puppy may cower or seek assurance from you, or vocalize in a distressed way when confronted with a loud truck, a person, an exuberant dog, or a box that was delivered on the front porch.\nAt this stage, puppies are extremely receptive to new experiences, and positive ones have a long-lasting effect on them. They are far more likely to accept new experiences, new situations, and new social partners later on in life if they have a lot of experiences and meet many social partners during this stage than if they are not exposed to much during this critical time. The socialization period for dogs is a window of time during which exposure to the big wide world sets them up for success.\nIt begins as early as three weeks, but the main socialization period for most new puppy parents is from eight weeks until well into their fourth month on the planet. The window for socialization does not close abruptly, but does so gradually.\nDuring this stage, puppies learn a lot, such as who their family is, who they can play with, where to pee and poop, what sound, sights and smells are normal, and how to respond to many cues. Expect a lot of attentiveness, a good amount of cuddling (but sometimes it doesn’t feel like enough!), wake-ups in the middle of the night for potty breaks, and probably some accidents in the house, though most dogs get a good handle on the general idea that the bathroom is outside during this time.\nAt the start of this phase, expectmaximumcuteness from your puppy. Astudy in 2018showed that people find puppies at around eight weeks of age to be the very cutest — more adorable than they are when younger or older. It’s a good thing, too, because when we are not getting enough sleep and putting in all the work to raise a young puppy, that peak cuteness helps our bodies produce chemicals that enhance our bonding and social connection to our puppies.\nMany people feel especially close to their puppy during this time because puppies at this age often want to be with them no matter where they go. It’s common for puppies of this age to follow you wherever you go even when not on a leash, and that makes being with them very special.\nPuppies in a new home need patience and gentleness as they make this big transition. During this stage, it’s important to spend lots of time with your puppy to help them with this major adjustment.\nIt’s essential to socialize puppies during this time. That means providing them lots of opportunities to meet other dogs, to meet people, and to go to new places, all in ways that make these positive experiences for your puppy. It’s essential that the exposure they have to aspects of their world are good experiences, so focus on that, instead of exposing them to as much as possible.\nBasically, consider this: If they meet people and other dogs and cats, hear the blender; the washing machine and loud trucks; walk on carpets and tile floors, grass, and rocks; go to new places and smell new things, and those experiences are pleasant for them, that’s wonderful. If they have a bad time, that’s counterproductive. Associating new experiences with treats and not forcing your puppy to be too close to anything they don’t choose to approach goes a long way. Apuppy class that focuses on socializationis a great option.These early weeks are a great time for training. Even young puppies can learn many basic skills such as to sit when they greet anyone or before they eat, to come when called, to be comfortable in a crate, to walk on a leash, the beginnings of a solid “stay,” to wait at the door, to touch a target, and so much more. They will need much more training throughout their life, but they can begin to learn basic skills, as well as learn that training can be fun because treats, toys, and attention are wonderful reinforcements for responding to cues.\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nFour months to one year\nAs puppies leave their socialization period behind, they head toward adolescence, which begins by six months of age and follows the pattern of adolescence everywhere. Puppies seek increased independence and explore more on their own and head further away from us than they used to. They become increasingly less attentive to us and sometimes seem not to hear us or notice us, even when we are giving cues they used to respond to reliably.\nPuppies at this stage need more activity than they used to and generally seem hungry for things to do, stimulation, and frequently for the company of other dogs and of people. Some of the activity they seek is chewing, as many puppies have what seems like a desperate need to chew, especially when they are in the range of eight to 10 months old, though that varies.\nAt some point in the second half of their first year of life, dogs typically enter a fear period. During this time, they will often react fearfully to things that didn’t used to bother them and to some new situations or objects as well. They will often seek comfort from you when they become overwhelmed by something in their world.\nProviding your dog with what they need at this stage is generally about offering them a lot of opportunities to engage with the world and protecting them from potential trouble in that world.\nTraining is a great way to engage your dog’s mind and work on your connection to each other. Lots of training — to state the obvious — also offers the incredible benefit of having a well-trained dog. It’s wise to train at home inside and outside, on walks, in the car, and everywhere you go. Classes are a great opportunity to offer new and stimulating experiences to your pup.\nContinue exposing your dog to new experiences, whether that means walking with another person and their dog, staying overnight with you at a relative’s house, going to dog-friendly shops and cafes, or moving your furniture around. More exploration of the world at parks, in a new neighborhood, or a dog training facility can be fun and stimulating for your dog.\nIn general, at this stage, it’s wise to avoid boredom or inactivity for your dog. In addition to training and exploring, it’s great to play with your dog and to have other people play with your dog. Set up playdates for your dog with dogs of various ages and types who have good social skills and like to play with young dogs. Monitor the play to make sure they are playing appropriately and that everyone is having a good time.\nOffer your dog food puzzles to keep them busy when you are otherwise occupied. It’s helpful to feed your dog in a way that takes effort for them rather than just in a bowl. That way, feeding itself is an enriching activity. Chew toys are essential for many dogs at this stage, so provide them regularly and often. It‘s far better to give them items that aremeantto be chewed on than to have an adolescent dog seeking them out and finding shoes, furniture, or kitchen utensils to satisfy their need to chew.\nDon’t worry; it’s just a phase!\nBe mindful of dangers to your dog that were not an issue when they were young and tended to stick close by you, or only wandered slowly away. As dogs get faster and more independent, it is crucial to protect them from going into the road or running up to other dogs.\nThose experiences can be traumatizing and dangerous. As predictable as these risks are, they can take people by surprise if they forget their puppies are changing and don’t stick right by them like before. Keep them safe, and don’t give them too much freedom — especially because dogs at this age are likely to be less responsive to cues than they used to be. Don’t count on them to respond to being called to come as they did when they were younger and like they will again when they are older (if you keep up on your training, that is!).\nHelp them and comfort them when they are afraid. If they react in a fearful way, the best approach is to stay calm, get them out of the situation, and comfort them. Help them overcome their fears by not coercing them into a situation that is too much for them, and by gradually exposing them to a minor version of what scares them while associating it with truly delicious treats or play.\nSo, if men start to seem scary to them, have a man toss your dog treats or a ball, depending on what makes your dog happiest. If the fear is of dumpsters, for example, offer your dog a treat every time you see one from a distance. Over time, you can approach more closely, but keep offering treats in that context.\nOne year to two years\nThey are not technically puppies after a year, but they are not adults until closer to age two, so this phase is still part of their development. Anything that happens during this time influences their behavior and their emotions in adulthood.\nHow to get your pet to stop chewing on inedibles from clothes to couches.\nPups at this age tend to have high energy demands. They are likely to be able to play or walk or hike for long time periods, rest only briefly, and be ready to go again with great enthusiasm. They are likely to have an interest in all kinds of activities:  games,food puzzles, training, sports, and more. Throughout this stage, dogs gradually increase their attentiveness and are less likely to seem distracted or ignore you.\nDuring this time, dogs require a lot of activity, and a major part of being their parent at this time is providing it. They need lots of exercise, so running, fetching, tugging, and hiking are wonderful opportunities to spend time with your dog and meeting their needs.\nEnrichment is so important throughout dogs’ lives, and now is the time they are likely to enjoy all kinds of it. Everything from frozen Kongs to opportunities to dig to attending a training class, picking up dog sports like agility and dock diving, or doing nose work will help make your dog’s life full and keep their brain and body busy.\nLots of training is a great way to spend time with your dog and engage their interest and attention. Because dogs at this age are better able to pay attention, it’s a great time to work on all kinds of skills. Recalls, stays, tricks, targeting, sit and down, wait at the door, “leave it” — all these skills are ones that make life a little easier and more fun for both of you. Training classes are a great option, thoughtraining every daya little bit here and there is essential if you want your dog to truly master these skills.\nMany dogs relax and will have a quick rest after some training. Additionally, training makes it easier to take your dog on outings or have people over — both good ways to make your dog’s life more fun and full of interest.\nThose little razor teeth are no fun.\n“Enjoy them at whatever stage they’re in”\nI have complained many times to my wonderful mother-in-law that when all my friends tell mother-in-law horror stories, I have nothing to share. Luckily, though, I can still write about her because she gave me some of the best advice I’ve ever received. She told me, “Enjoy your children at whatever stage they’re in,” and it’s good advice for raising dogs, too. It’s just a little easier to enjoy each stage if you know what to expect and what to do.\nReferences:\nDog Pups’ Attractiveness to Humans Peaks at Weaning Age",

    "page_content": "Kinship’ssenior editor, Hilary Weaver, recently said something that really resonated with me. In our casual discussion about dogs before getting down to the business of our meeting (which was also about dogs!), she said to me, “Life is a lot — including two dogs, one deaf and one a young cattle dog — but they are also the reason I am OK half the time.”\nThat sums up what’s probably true for most of us — if we are hanging on by a thread at any point in this busy world, our dog is that thread (or is at least holding the thread!) and if we are in a good place emotionally, you better believe our dogs are there with us. Hilary reminded me how much we all give to our dogs and how much they give back, specifically when it comes to being the champions of keeping our stress in check.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nSo much of the stress from daily life can be absorbed and fixed by our best friends, which just naturally happens. There’s a reason so many people consider a day where they don’t tell the world about how much they love their dog to be a day wasted. But even though so much stress relief happens simply because we share our lives with dogs, we can actively maximize that benefit of dog parenthood.\nEnrich your dog’s life by doing what comes naturally.\nFirst, I want to be clear, because being misunderstood leads to trolls, which leads to stress, which leads to more criticism. I’m not talking aboutusingdogs. We can make our dogs part of our successful battle against the stresses of the modern world,andadd to our dog’s quality of life at the same time. In fact, it’s better for our dogs if we are OK. One of the major lessons I’ve learned as a parent of humans is easily transferable to being a dog parent:I have to take care of me so I can take care of you! So, keep in mind that these strategies about actively planning ways for our dogs to help us minimize our stress benefits them, too.\nReframe from “I have to” to “I get to” walk my dog.\nThe right perspective is everything, and if you remember what a joy it is to be with your dog, it makes the work of having one easier. So, every time you walk your dog (and we all know we don’t always feel like it every time!) let your inner voice speak this truth: “I get to walk my dog” instead of listening to some downer of a voice saying, “I have to walk my dog now.”\nMake the most of even five-minute breaks.\nDogs are so powerful that even a few minutes of connecting with them can make us feel so much better — less stressed and oh-so-much happier. If you can’t be with your dog during the day, you can still get a stress-busting lift, courtesy of your best friend. Watch a video of your dog, and just try not to say “Awwww” too loud and bother any of your co-workers.\nSeeing your dog playing, sleeping, dreaming, or looking at you even on video can make you feel better, and the effect may be even more important if it keeps you off social media. If your dog is at daycare or at home with a webcam, tune in for a few minutes to watch them live. You can take a quick break to interact with them throughFurbo 360, which gives you the ability to watch them, talk to them, and deliver treats to them.\nIf you are one of the lucky ones who is with your dog when you work because you either work from home or because you canbring your dog to work, there are plenty of five-minute break options that allow your dog to stomp on your stress. Just a quick game of fetch or tug, a short belly rub, snuggles or cuddles of any kind, a brief training session, or showing off a trick your dog knows to anyone willing to watch are all good for your soul and help alleviate stress. If being outside is possible for any of these five-minute breaks, just the natural light and fresh air can be good for countering stress, and so often it’s our dogs who are the motivator for getting outside.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nStart and end your day right by having zen time with your dog.\nHaving something to look forward to makes life better, and dogs are there for it. Just knowing you are about to have some enjoyable time with your dog can make getting out of bed easier for some of us. Of course, for others including those who are true night owls, having to get up so your dog can go outside is torture, so if even your dog can’t tame the horror of facing the morning, that’s OK.\nNot every benefit of having a dog applies to all of us. Having a dog to come home to and looking forward to time together after work is another aspect of pet parenting that may not apply universally. If it does apply to you, lean into the joy of looking forward to coming home to your dog, and enjoy that reunion. If it doesn’t, and you feel pressured to care for your dog right after work rather than being able to go out with friends or do something else recreational, it’s okay. Dogs require work from all of us — the benefits outweigh the costs, but I would never downplay the costs.\nTime your walks optimally for you.\nDog walking is a must for most dogs, so it only makes sense to walk your dogs at the time that’s best for you. Depending on your work schedule, the weather, how your day is going, or what brings you the most joy, that can vary. Perhaps the best time to walk your dog today is after a stressful meeting. Or the best time might be at the end of the day when you have no more obligations, and you can really relax and enjoy the moment.\nYou could also benefit from being outside with your dog as the sun is setting. Health professionals know that just havinga routine can help us manage stressmore effectively, so walking on a regular schedule at a predictable time of day can reduce our stress, as long as trying to stick to a routine against your nature doesn’t add stress. It’s easier to stick to a walking routine if there is a set of warm puppy dog eyes looking at us hopefully conveying the message that it is time for the regularly scheduled walk.\nHarness the power of training to reduce stress in your life.\nThe many benefits of training aren’t usually viewed in the context of stress reduction, but they certainly should be. Training done with positive reinforcement is fun and bonding for you and your dog, and can therefore be an antidote to the stress of modern life.\nAdditionally, the success of learning new skills enhances self-esteem, and having tricks or other feats to perform adds to confidence, both of which can counteract stress. And, having a better-trained dog makes so many aspects of life less stressful, so train skills that make your life more relaxing.\nFor example, if you have trained your dog togreet visitors at the doorpolitely, towalk nicely on a leash, to step on the scale at the vet’s office, toenter their cratewillingly, to stay, to come when called, and to show off a trick or two to break the ice in social settings, life is generally better all around.\n(And your own, while you’re at it.)\nDogs naturally offer direct physical benefits with stress-busting powers, so act accordingly.\nJust by being themselves, our dogs provide us withhealth and mood-enhancers. Petting them, playing with them, and even just hanging out with them results in a variety of stress-reducing benefits. Petting dogslowers people’s blood pressureandreduces their levels of cortisol, which is the hormone released when we are stressed. Playing with dogs elevates our dopamine and serotonin levels, which helps us relax and feel peacefully calm. We can capitalize on these stress-busting opportunities by interacting with our dogs, doing so regularly and when we are at risk of feeling stress or already experiencing it.\nMore exercise is the most famous stress buster dogs offer.\nIt’s hardly news that dog parents tend to exercise more than their friends and relatives who don’t have dogs, or that exercise helps relieve stress. Not only does exercising give us a break from our daily to do lists, itchanges our brain chemistry in a way that improves our emotional well-being. These happy brain chemicals — or endocannabinoids, if you prefer a more technical term — and the changes to our bodies and brain during exercise have huge impacts on many aspects of our lives. Endocannabinoids lower stress, enhance mood, increase pain tolerance, and improve our sleep. That last one — sleep — is huge because better sleep improves our ability to handle stress, so we experience less of it.\nSo, the question is not about whether the exercise your dog prompts you to get is a stress buster (because, yes, yes it is!) but which type of exercise suits you and your dog best. All kinds of exercise are beneficial, so it really depends on what you and your dog enjoy doing together.Running is a great optionfor many people and dogs, but if that idea is unappealing, choose another way to be active. You cantake your dog biking, either in a basket as a rider or as a runner alongside you, depending on your dog. Tons of dogslove swimming, and it’s great exercise for both of you — fun, relaxing, refreshing, and without strain on the joints (that’s especially helpful for many older dogs). Besides these classic sports of the standard triathlon, you couldtry skijoring, which is essentially cross country skiing while your dog pulls you, orsoft hiking, which is basically just a chill walk with slight elevation and a pretty view.\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nAdd stress busting to the long list of dogs’ superpowers.\nTaking care of and raising dogs is a lot of work, but it’s a labor of love and also beneficial to people. With the many proactive, specific ways our dogs can help us relieve our stress, the simple fact of the matter is that dogs deserve the accolade of “world’s best stress-busters.” Yet, it’s a feat they accomplish in part just by being with us and being their sweet selves, decreasing your stress just by existing.  It’s that simple and that beautiful.\nReferences:\nHealth References of Having a Routine\nHealth References of Having a Routine\nPsychophysiological Mechanisms Underlying the Potential Health Benefits of Human-Dog Interactions: A Systematic Literature Review\nPsychophysiological Mechanisms Underlying the Potential Health Benefits of Human-Dog Interactions: A Systematic Literature Review\nPet Ownership and the Risk of Arterial Hypertension and Cardiovascular Disease\nPet Ownership and the Risk of Arterial Hypertension and Cardiovascular Disease",

In the past couple days alone, I have asked the internet whether my dog’seye gunk is a normal color, if she will be emotionally scarred from having topoop in the snow, and whether she thinks I’m her mom or her wife. (Yes, no, and both.)\nIf my dog were a human child — which, in many ways, she is — I’d be teetering on the edge of helicopter parenting. This type of parent is typically characterized by being overly attentive, excessively cautious, Googling questions like “best everyday body armor for kids,” and general hovering. Understandably, this level of parental hyper-vigilance comes with a stigma.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nWhat’s the link between helicopter parenting and mental health?\nLast year, a team of Norwegian researchers reviewed 38 different studies focusedon helicopter parentingand symptoms of anxiety and depression. They found that a majority of these studies suggested a relationship between helicopter parenting and anxiety/depression, though they noted the evidence is “insufficient” and needs to be investigated further.\nIn 2018, astudy from the American Psychological Associationfound that toddlers who experienced“over-controlling” parentingat age two had poorer behavioral and emotional regulation at age five. Alternatively, children who exhibited stronger emotional and behavioral regulation at age five were less likely to have social or emotional issues at age ten. The same year, theNew York Timespublished an article on parentshelping versus “helicoptering”their children, asking questions like, “Are we abetting dependency?” and “Can we allow our child to be uneasy?”\nWe asked both animal behaviorists and human psychologists howyoucan deal with leaving your dog home alone.\nOften, it starts from a place of love. We want the ones we care about to be safe, healthy, and happy — pets included. In turn, it’s all too easy to let legitimate concerns grow to full-blown panic. If this sounds familiar as a fellow pet parent, fear not. (Er, fearless.) Here’s what you need to know about helicopter parenting your dog.\nWhat isa helicopter pet parent and am I one?\nThere is no definitive test to determine whether you’re a helicopter parent (for children, dogs, or otherwise). This is great news if you’d prefer to panic in peace but not so helpful if you’re trying to ease your own anxieties. Fortunately, I spoke to a couple of experts who offered insight into what helicopter parenting could look like for pet parents.\n“In my experience, helicopter dog parenting often manifests as jumping to the worst possible conclusion about your pet,” Margaret, an animal shelter educator in the Kansas City, Missouri, area, tells me. She used the examples of rushing to the vet because you’re worried your dog yawns too much or assuming that if your dog growls at one (one) stranger, you’ll never be allowed to take them in public again.\nMargaret continues: “As a self-confessed helicopter dog parent myself, I am constantly going over my girls with a (sometimes literal) fine-toothed comb in order to look for new bumps and bruises.” Even the professionals do it!\nWhich comes first: a nervous person or a nervous pup?\nRobert Haussmann, a certified professional dog trainer, behavior consultant, and Kinship Collective member, says he often sees helicopter pet parenting manifest as over policing a dog’s innate instincts.\n“Many clients over-police their dog’sability to sniff and explorebecause they are so concerned about what the dog may eat,” he says, noting that this kind of concern is understandable after you’ve “pulled the fourth mystery tissueout of your dog’s mouth.” But, he adds: “Sniffing and exploring is crucial to a puppies development and an adult dog’s quality of life.”\nThere are studies that suggest anxious pet parentstend to have anxious dogs. But like the studies with human helicopter parents, the findings aren’t conclusive, nor are they causational. Like most things in life, the key is striking a balance between your own caution and your dog’s curiosity.\n“I think it’s great when people are hyper aware of their dog's well being,” Haussman says, noting that dog’s lives are enriched by parents who research diet, engage in exercise, encourage mental stimulation, and the like. “It can go off the rails however when people micromanage their dogs ability to explore or socialize,” he continues, adding that it’s important to let dogs “navigate the rich tapestry of canine social communication.”\nAs someone who works in an animal shelter, Margaret sees plenty of positives in “helicopter” pet parenting. “I would much, much rather someone err on the side of over-attentiveness rather than the side of indifference or cruelty,” she says, noting that being hypervigilant could help you catch early signs of illness or keep your pet from, say,eating something they shouldn’t. “You may get the occasional eye roll from your mother whowanted human grandchildren,” she continues. “But so be it.”\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nIf you’re concerned about helicopter-parenting your pet, Haussman recommends working with a professional trainer. “New dog owners especially benefit from learning what is normal behavior and when to be concerned,” he says.\nMargaret offers some basic questions pet parents can ask themselves as a gut check: Does your dog have consistent access to good food and clean water? Does your dog have a comfortable place to rest? Does your dog have the space and opportunity to do the things dogs do (run, play, etc.)? Is your dog safe? Does your dog have regular access to medical care? “If the answer to all of the above is ‘yes,’” she says. “Then, your dog is likely feeling happy, healthy, and loved!” And if you have concerns, you can always talk to your vet.\nBoth experts recommend following your dog’s lead. “Remember that dogs like doing dog stuff,” Haussman says. “Micromanaging, being overly protective or strict can add stress for both you and your dog.”\nAbove all, what’s most important is having a well-loved pet. For some, that may mean letting your dog explore a little more or, yes, double-checking that blueberries are safe for dogs to eat.

    "page_content": "The world is divided into people whose dogs absolutely love everything about snow and people whose dogs don’t want to poop in snow, thus making winter a horribly stressful and annoying season. The problem has been magnified lately because we’re in another winter of wild weather. Far too many of us are facing giant snowstorms, huge drifts, and extreme cold.\nThe shoveling, road conditions, and heating bills are bad enough, but thisno-that’s-not-the-bathroom-anymoreattitude of dogs across the nation and beyond is making snow Enemy Number One. If you have found yourself in the yard saying with despair, “Oh for the love of god will youpleasejust come out and poop?” you may want to come inside, yank off your boots, and read a bit about how to make this snowy winter easier on you and your dog.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHow to make the snowy season your dog's favorite time of year.\nWhy do dogs hate pooping in the snow?\nIf your dog refuses to poop in snow (or pee), it’s natural to feel frustrated and annoyed. You’re frustrated because you are spending a lot of time outside trying to get your dog to poop when you could be inside with hot cocoa, happily enjoying the winter wonderland from the coziness of your favorite chair. You’re annoyed because cleaning up poop and pee when your dog has been properly housetrained for years is annoying (and maddening and gross, and unfair, and, well you get the idea.)\nEverybody has a perfect right to feel how they feel, but I must put in a word for our dogs here and suggest that another worthwhile way to feel is sympathetic. When a dog doesn’t want to poop in the snow, it’s not because they are being difficult. This situation is a classic example of a dog who ishavinga hard time rather than a dog who isgivingyou a hard time. They are most likely confused or uncomfortable, and they need our help.\nPuppies are used to whatever surface they were trained on —grass, leaves, concrete, or pee pads — and will likely prefer that for the rest of their life. When dogs encounter snow for the first time, they often just don’t know that it is OK to pee or poop on it. So, while raising a puppy in the dead of winter has its challenges (read: miseries), those who learn their housetraining skills at this time are less likely to balk at the snow each season. Clearly a lot of dogs make sense of snow either right away or eventually. Otherwise, yellow snow would not be a thing.\nThe issue of discomfort is a little more obvious — it’s cold! There’s the cold winter air itself and the cold snow which doesn’t feel good on their paws (or on their legs or bellies or…well, anywhere). If your dog is unfamiliar with snow, it’s not a fun feeling. Dogs who get cold easily (the ones who shiver when it drops below 70 are just like me!) aren’t always fans of the cold under any circumstances, but can barely keep their heads above all the fluffy white stuff after a blizzard. It’s understandable that they would be particularly resistant to head out at all — and unable to relax enough to do their business once they do.\nAnd if their fur traps snowballs on their feet, legs, and belly, they have every reason to object when we expect them to endure that. Individual dogs vary in their ability to handle cold, but generally speaking, small and slender ones with short fur suffer the most.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for helping an adult dog learn to go outside in a new environment.\nTips to help your dog poop in the snow\nSometimes it’s the little things — just a few tweaks and your dog is back to business (literally). In other cases, a touch more effort may be needed, but all these tips have been successful for many people and their dogs.\nOne method is to shovel a pathway from the door to the potty area — a patch of grass or, better yet, a spot protected from the snow, such as under a balcony. Most dogs are more likely to do their business if a snow-free zone is easily accessible to them so that they can quickly rush back indoors.\nAlso, if the area smells more like what they are used to, it is easier for them to poop like they usually do. Keep up with the poop pickup — daily poop pick-up is more important than ever during this season. Using kitty litter on the ground can provide pups with better traction when things get slippery. If all else fails, hire a professional pooper-scooper company.\nSome dogs have shy bladders, but others will appreciate a show of solidarity. You may not want to accompany your dog out in freezing temperatures, but you may also find that it leads to success. It could take several outings, though — if five to 10 minutes have gone by and your dog still hasn’t gone, bring them back inside, but on a leash so they can’t sneak off behind your back.\nThough this method takes considerable effort, it does work for most dogs. Some dogs struggle when their yard is blanketed with snow but are more inspired to go to the bathroom on walks through the neighborhood. Leading your dog to areas where other dogs have already gone (seek out that yellow snow) may encourage your dog, too.\nDressing for success is not just a business idea. It applies to everything in life, it includes our dogs, and it can be the difference maker when it comes to convincing them to potty outside, just as they do in the summer. Sometimes the reason a dog won’t potty when it’s cold is not about the snow at all. Some dogs won’t poop in cold weather, even if the ground is dry. They are happy to remain where it’s warm and stayoccupied inside, thank you very much, and the result is a dog who poops inside when the weather is cold.\nCanine coatsare functional, as well as fashionable. Putting socks, booties, or boots on your dog’s feet can be the difference-maker in some cases. Dressing your dog for winter weather can make them more comfortable and more willing to head outside. Warm-weather clothing may make them willing to stay outside long enough to take care of business. I myself never go outside in the most foul of winter weather (not even to the mailbox!) without properly suiting up.\nA snow poop tent for the dog can make everybody’s life easier. If you didn’t know you needed a dog snow poop tent, well, now you do! It’s exactly what it sounds like — a tent that protects the ground from the snow so there is still a grass or dirt area that your dog can use as the bathroom during winter.\nUsing a sports pop-up tent can work, especially if you use plywood to make sides that keep snow from blowing in. You can use an old camping tent with the floor removed, or build your own out of whatever materials you want. As long as the area is protected from snow, and there is no floor to it so your dog can smell the great outdoors, a dog snow poop tent may be the solution you need. Some dogs walk to the poop tent to go, and others get carried — whatever works!\nFor dogs who don’t want to walk on snow or are otherwise uncomfortable using the yard in the winter, try changing the surface for them. Putting down hay or straw is enough to help some dogs overcome their anti-poop protest.\nOther dogs do well if you put out an old carpet remnant on top of the snow. Anything to make it more comfortable for the season is worth trying! The straw can be left in the yard, but the carpet remnant is something I would pitch once springtime comes. It’s hard to clean it after a season of being out in the elements and being pooped on.\nTips you’ll want to pay attention to.\nTraining your dog to poop in the snow\nIf you want to know how to get dogs to poop (and pee!) in the snow, don’t forget the obvious. Training your dog makes the behavior you want more likely to happen, so training your dog to poop and pee in the snow is an important piece of the puzzle. But training will be so much more effective if you start early, long before you look outside and see a winter wonderland that you didn’t ask for and you know your dog could do without.\nWhen it snows, go back to a housetraining 101 approach. Take your dog out when there is just the smallest hint of snow (I know, it’s hard to coordinate with Jack Frost, but do your best) and encourage them to poop. You can encourage a dog to poop by taking them to a spot they usually like to use, give them the cue you taught them, and wait. Patience is important.\nWhen they do go, give them, and be generous with them. Every chance you get to have them be in light snow is an opportunity to teach them that the snow is not covering the bathroom; the snowisthebathroom. Take them into the yard and on walks to pee and poop —  flexibility about bathrooms is the goal! As the snow accumulates, you may need to clear a path or shovel out an area for their business, depending on their size and their changing attitude toward pooping in the snow.\nWe all want our dogs to besafe in the snow and cold. There are temperatures too low for dogs to be outside safely, but those vary for every dog. The average Husky will be able to handle winter weather without risking frostbite, unlike the average Basenji, but it’s wise to ask your vet about limitations for your particular dog. And temperatures that are too low for an all-day adventure or even a 45-minute walk may not be too cold for a quick visit outside to pee and poop.\nThe temperature at which your dog cries foul about having an outside bathroom, however, is entirely up to them. They have the final say on when it is too cold for a dog to poop outside without your help. It doesn’t matter what other experts might say. In this case, your dog has the only expert opinion on the subject that really matters. They know when it is too cold for a dog to poop outside, and you can figure it out because they may refuse to go into the yard at all, or you may find you have a dog pooping in the house in cold weather.\nIf your teeth are chattering, theirs probably are, too.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nIt’s better to scoop poop right away before it freezes in the snow and becomes a gross spring thaw situation. The best way to pick up dog poop in snow is the same as in warmer seasons — with aplastic poop bagor a shovel.\nTheories about why dogs cover their poop with snow include concealing their scent from rivals. Another possibility is they are pawing at the ground to mark the spot with glands in their paws rather than actually trying to bury their poop.\nDogs who are sensitive to cold are less likely to want to poop in the snow. Dogs who are small, have short legs, are slender, or who have short fur are generally more common in the anti-snow poopers group.",

If your pup runs in the other direction of their new winter coat or goes berserk when you try to pull their fuzzy little legs through the sleeves, you aren’t alone; lots of dogs are resistant to dressing up. But don’t stress: There are ways to train your dog to appreciate their winter wardrobe.\nBefore you start training, though, you should also consider whether or not your pup really needs a winter coat. If they naturally have a long, thick coat — think Husky or Pomeranian — they probably do not need to wear a coat or jacket. But if your dog is slick-coated, very young, elderly, or suffering from a medical condition like arthritis, a coat can help keep them comfortable when temperatures drop. Also, in winter, dog coats can help keep your small pup from shivering; it’s harder for little guys to retain body heat.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nIt’s also a good idea to consider how long you’re going to be outside.

But if you’re planning to take a hike on a cold winter’s dayin the snow, they’ll probably appreciate some extra help staying warm.\nWe all have to up our moisturizing game in the fall and winter.\nDo dogs get cold?\nSeriously, though, do dogs need coats? Just like people,dogs can get cold, but justwhenthey get cold depends on things like their coat length and type, as well as size. Some breeds, such as the Alaskan Malamute and Siberian Husky, are bred for cold weather and may even be reluctant to come inside out of the snow, while smaller dogs may start shivering at the first cold snap.\nExperiencing intense cold without the proper protection is dangerous for dogs and can lead to hypothermia, which can be fatal in serious cases. Cold weather can alsocause frostbiteon your dog’s ears, tail, or paws.\nIs it safe to put a winter coat on my dog?\nA winter jacket is perfectly safe for your pup, as long as you only dress them up at the proper time. Never put a coat on them when the weather is mild or they’re indoors, because this can lead to overheating. And no matter how cute they look, don’t force your dog to wear a coat if they’re ardently opposed. Instead,use positive reinforcementto encourage them over time.\nThe most mouth-watering treats for training your pup.\nHow to decide if your dog needs a jacket\nNot every dogneedsa winter coat.

It’s always a good idea to monitor pups when they’re outside in cold weather, so you can notice any signs that they’re struggling with the dropping temperatures.\nIf your dog is especially active, even in winter, dog coats may just not be necessary. You don’t want them to have the opposite problem and get overheated. But at what temperature do dogs need coats to stay warm?

Learn if your pup can get a cold, too.\nHow to train a dog to wear a coat\nYou can actually train them to like (OK, tolerate) wearing a coat by changing how they feel about it. In other words, instead of being scared of the coat, they can learn to at least accept it.\nFirst of all, arm yourself with some delicious,high-value treats. (Note: When training a new behavior, especially when you’re trying to change your dog’s emotional response to something, it’s best to use treats they absolutely love but don’t typically get.) Then, choose a time when they are relatively relaxed, such as after a long walk or playing fetch, to begin the process of acclimating them to dog winter clothes.\nPut the coat on the floor several feet away from your dog and observe their reaction. If they run away or show anysigns of stress— yawning, flicking their tongue, closing their mouth tightly, turning their body away — you’ll need to put even more distance between them and the coat.\nOnce your dog shows no reaction to the coat, praise them and give them a treat. Still keeping a good distance between your dog and the coat, put the coat down and wait for them to look at it. They don’t have to sniff it or even walk near it; a quick glance will do. Praise and treat! Do this several more times.\nContinue with this exercise as you move the coat closer to your dog. Remember, you’re still not actually touching them with the coat; you’re just decreasing the distance between the two of them and giving them a treat when they look at it.\nOnce they understand that simply looking at the coat results in a treat, try gently touching the coat to one of their front legs for a second. Don’t put it on yet; just touch your pup briefly with it. Try the front legs at first — you want to make sure thet can see what you’re doing. No one likes surprises, especially when it’s something theymay think is scary.\nIf your dog stands there and does nothing, give them a treat and lots of praise. If they seem only mildly stressed, take the coat away and then, holding a treat near their nose, try touching them again very gently with the coat. If the seemverystressed, go back to the previous step where they get rewarded just for looking at the coat.\nOnce you can touch them with the coat, try petting them with the coat in your hand. If they don’t move or show any sign of stress, give them a treat.\nYou get the idea. The key is baby steps. Take your time and don’t rush moving on to the next step. Soon, they will connect the dots and realize everything to do with the coat results in treats.\nWhen you’re finally ready to put the coat on your dog, just lay it over their back for a second, then remove it and treat them. Only when they’re comfortable at this stage (about eight out of 10 times) should you try putting the coat on and fastening it. Just like any other behavioral training, this is a process. Be patient and go slowly.\nSki-club balaclavas, waterproof wellies, all-natural nose balm, and more gear to help outdoorsy pet parents get the most out of the season.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nThebest winter coats for dogsshould fully cover their neck, belly, and back, running from the nape of the neck to the tail. The coat should fit them snugly but not be too tight or restrict their movement.\nSome dogs handle cold better than others, such as those with thick, fluffy coats. Smaller dogs, puppies, senior dogs, and those with thin fur will likely need at leastdog sweaters, if not coats or jackets when the temperature is below freezing. When the temperature is below 20 degrees Fahrenheit, monitor your dog, regardless of breed, for any signs of discomfort caused by the cold.\nWhen the temperature is between 10 and 32 degrees Fahrenheit (below freezing), dogs should not spend longer than 10 to 15 minutes outside — just long enough to do their business. When temperatures fall below 10 degrees,keep your dog inside.\nJust like they do for humans, coats can help your dog stay warm in cold weather, especially if they have a short coat or are on the smaller side.

Otherwise, your dog may get frustrated, leading to the opposite of what is intended through enrichment and mental stimulation.\nChoosing the best puzzle toy for your dog\nNot all toys are the same, and not all dogs will respond to the same toys. If your dog needs activity, try a treat game that slowly dispenses treats or kibble while they chase it around the house (preferably away from where you’re working). “Some dogs will eat out of a puzzle toy but not out of a bowl,” Alldredge says. If your dog does not have that problem, but rather is such a fast eater that they make themselves sick, try a snuffle mat that replicates foraging behavior and slows mealtime down. If your dog needsconfidence building, try a simple puzzle game and gradually work them up to more difficult ones.\n“A few years ago, I bought one of every dog puzzle game on the market,” Alldredge says. “Andwow— some of them, like theNina Ottossonones, were so hard to figure out!” Puzzle toys aren’t just for puppies, either. “The biggest mistake people make is forgetting that adult dogs need entertainment, too.” Below, the top 18 best dog puzzle toys.

Its irregular shape allows your pup to nose it around for hours and never tire of it.\nSustainable\nGives Back\nFor super energetic pups, the iDig is where it’s at. This toy allows pet parents to hide treats and kibble under the flap, so pups can let out some ofthose zoomiesby digging their way to the prize.\n“Diggers need to dig,” trainer and Kinship Collective member Nicole Ellistold us. “I often hear frustration from pet parents about theirdogs diggingin the yard, couch, and on the bed. Dogs naturally love to dig; it’s an innate desire. Instead of reprimanding your dog(s) for digging, give them somewhere to dig. And yes, evencats love this toy!”\nFor dogs who benefit from a more complicated treat-dispensing, scent-releasing toy, this is it. It also works as an added layer of complication for games of fetch.\nSustainable\nGives Back\nRecycled\nThis intermediate level two design by Nina Ottosson includes additional obstacles and step combinations. It’s perfect for extra curious pups.\nWomen Owned\nKongs are less about solving a puzzle than keeping a dog busy. Fill this toy with your pup’s favorite treats, and they can bat it around for a fun interactive experience that will help keep theirseparation anxiety at baywhen you leave the house.\n“From puppies to seniors, everyone can enjoy a Kong,” trainerNicole Ellis said.“Studies have taught us that licking and chewing help release stress in dogs, and the Kong helps achieve that while allowing your pup to have fun. It also helps our dog get some mental enrichment and learn to settle and focus on something.”\nLet’s face it, half the toys we buy for our pets are because they’re just downright fun to look at — and this Petstages carrot toy is no exception. It’ll massage your pup’s gums and help remove plaque while keeping them entertained and out of trouble, which is a win-win if we’ve ever heard of one.\nThis very pretty slow feeder will stimulate your pup’s mind and also slow their roll while they feast upon their dinner.\nBehavioristKaren Londonweighed in onwhy she loves slow feedersfor pups: “My favorite way to keep dogs from scarfing down their food too quickly is to use a dog food puzzle or slow feeder dog bowl that is specific to this purpose ... Not only does this slow down their eating, but it also provides mental exercise and gives dogs valuable experience being persistent and handling a bit of frustration. Never a bad thing, right?”\nGives Back\nSquirrels and squeaks: two things that endlessly fascinate our dogs, together at last! You stuff the squeaky squirrels in the tree, and your dog’s job is to hunt all six of them down in a kind of hide and seek.\nGives Back\nThis “tricky” treat ball lives up to its name. All you have to do is insert your dog’s favorite treats into the ball, and then let your pup have at it. They’ll push, roll, and paw the ball until the food falls out of the single hole. The simple design makes for hours of fun for your dog.\nThis subscription box is made for dogs who love to chew. Beyond meaty chews and full-size bags of treats, these come with two fluff-free, ultra-durable toys, such as a treat-dispensing acorn. Did we mention they’rethemed?\nGives Back\nThe internal maze of these colorful globes slowly dispenses treats, preventing boredom and slowing down digestion.",

    "page_content": "Stereotypes cling to certain breeds like dog hair to a suede couch. No matter what the science says, some people think American Staffordshire Terriers (aka “pit bulls”) are aggressive, Labradors are saints, and Border Collies can be trained to speak English. More reasonable assumptions cling to dozens of other breeds, but there’s actually no innate quality that determines how easy or hard a particular dog is to train.\n“I’ve trained more than 25,000 dogs in my professional career,” says Stacy Alldredge, a certified dog trainer, behaviorist, and founder ofWho’s Walking Who. Her clients run the gamut of breed, age, disposition, and temperament, and she says trainability is more about individual temperament than anyparticular breed characteristics. “It’s not the breed, but the dog’s confidence and openness to training.”\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThat said, certain breeds are known to have temperaments that are generally easier to train, including the Border Collie, Golden Retriever, German Shepherd, Poodle, Corgi, Papillon, Australian Cattle Dog, Rottweiler, American Pit Bull Terrier, and Husky. While these dogs arelikely to be intelligentand eager to please, all of them possess unique traits. More than anything, consistent training methods and a skilled parent with clear motivation are the keys to success. (One way to improve your odds of training success?Incorporate plenty of playin your training routine.)\nAdaptability to new things, ability to self-soothe, sufficient exercise, consistent food and water, clear motivation (toys,high-value treats, praise), and a dedicated pet parent all contribute to a dog’s adaptability to training. Their willingness to obey commands depends less on keen intelligence than an interest in what humans want. This quality — call it “human interest” — does tend to appear more in certain breeds and breed mixes than others. The breed with themosthuman interest? Not a breed at all, but a rescue dog: food-motivated, eager to please, and — as many adopters will attest — grateful.\nInterestingly, one study indicates that female dogs may take to training better than males.A 1996 surveyof veterinarians and dog care professionals in the United Kingdom found that across breeds, male dogs were rated as more reactive, immature, and aggressive than female dogs. Female dogs, on the other hand, were considered easier to train — and were also more affectionate. (Important note: This survey was specific to purebred dogs.)\nMale or female, rescue or purebred, below you’ll find more about 10 breeds who are generally considered quick studies. We’ve grouped them by size and included breeds that are known to be family-friendly and that shed less than others. Be sure and read to the end for answers to three frequently asked questions about training.\nSmall dogs who are easy to train\nAdorable and apartment-friendly, small dogs are a popular choice for city dwellers and those who want to be able to easily scoop their pup up and tote them around. Here are a couple that may be easier to train than others.\nNamed for the French “butterfly,” this smart, lively dog with tricky hair can also have the attitude you’d expect from someone often painted on the laps of French noblewomen. The large and graceful ears do pick up instruction well, but as with many smaller dogs, Papillons need a lot of consistent training. Here aresome tips to get you started.\nAny dog who looks about 40 percent head must bekindof brainy, and with Welsh Corgis, the appearance does not deceive. Highly intelligent and food-motivated, they’re quick to learn but, like theirmost famous fan, Queen Elizabeth II, their independence can make them prone to lording over others. For best results, and if possible, put them on a training schedulewhen they’re puppies.\nMedium dogs who are easy to train\nNot too small, not too big, but just right, Goldilocks would have been a fan of a medium-sized dog. If you, too, want a just-right-sized dog who will sit, stay, and heel, one of these breeds might make the perfect addition to your household.\nPure love bombs of affection (despite whata lot of misinformationwould have you think), American Staffordshire Terriers, American Pit Bull Terriers, and mixes such as “Labrabulls” and “Pitadors” tend to be whip-smart and determined. Plus, they’re loyal, smart, and and easy to train to be your favorite buddy.\nSpitz family dogs (including Huskies, Malamutes, Akitas, andJapanese Spitzs) were selectively bred for hunting, herding, and pulling sleds. Be aware of their incredibly heavy coat and high energy levels. These dogs might be YouTube sensations for “singing” and “talking” adorably, but they have also been known to chew straight through doors and walls while their parents are at work. Again,training them from puppyhoodis helpful, if you adopt them young enough.\nThis working dog’s rep for intelligence keeps growing, thanks to verbose characters likeChaserhere. But as any schoolteacher knows, a brilliant kid can also be quite a handful: intense, quick-thinking, hypersensitive to sound and touch. Training a Border Collie means managing extraordinary mental and physical energy. Think of them as a hyperactive roommate bent on outsmarting you.\nLarge dogs who are easy to train\nIf you grew up with Clifford the Big Red Dog, theBeethovenmovies, and Marmaduke, you likely have a soft spot for large dogs. These breeds make excellent, and highly biddable, big buddies.\nA herding dog apart, German Shepherds tend to be unusually driven and intelligent, quick to read signals and learn tasks, and extremely self-assured. What they’re not so good at is chilling. They need competent, confident parents, and training is not optional but amust. (If you adopt them when they’re older,try these methods.)\nComfortably one of the top 10 most intelligent breeds, the Rottweiler learns quickly and has a history as a guard dog. Descended from the Roman Mastiff, who herded cattle throughout Europe, their strength and protectiveness later made them favorites of German police. Darkly handsome looks aside, they’re no more aggressive than any other dog, but their size and strength make it essential that they do get trained, even if it’s relatively easy. (“Leave it” isan especially important commandto teach this breed.)\nFamily dogs who are easy to train\nMany people feel that a house isn’t a home without a dog, and a family isn't complete without one, either. If you’re looking for a pup who gets along with children and takes to training easily, try one of these breeds.\nGolden Retrievers are popular family dogs for good reason: This breed has a reputation for being the one of the best all-around dog companions out there. Well-rounded, easygoing in most situations, and eager to please, they may make a better sibling for your child than another human baby (or at least, there’s likely to be less bickering and rivalry involved).\nStalwart workers, these dogs are very faithful, and, like all of the above breeds, known for their intelligence. Their loyalty makes them good family dogs, but as with the German Shepherd and Border Collie, their smarts, energy, and independence demand consistent boundaries from their parents. It’s best if they join your family early on and grow up alongside your kids, or come into the family when your children are on the older side — later elementary school age or older.\nDogs who don’t shed and are easy to train\nWhile all dogs shed to some extent, some breeds are less likely to leave a trail of fur than others. If you’re looking for a dog who won’t require you to vacuum your home from top to bottom daily — and is easy to train, to boot — try the following.\nDescended from the German Barbet and Hungarian Water Hound, this dog named after the German word for “puddle” has a well-earned rep for intelligence and hunting strength that makes them quick to learn — and belies the whimsical curly ’dos the breed is known for. That curly coat is what makes them seem to shed less, though what’s really happening is that the coils are keeping the fur from falling to the floor (or flying through the air). Give a Poodle a good brushing, and you’ll see that they do, indeed shed. They just conveniently keep it to themselves!\nFAQs (People also ask):\nAli Smith, dog trainer and founder ofRebarkable, answers three of the top training questions dog parents ask.\nWhile cleaning up accidents is a part of life for any pet parent, it’s certainly not one of the more fun ones. It stands to reason, then, that many people prefer to keep pee and poop cleanup to a minimum. Does breed matter when it comes to potty training? Smith says yes. “Some dogs are naturally ‘cleaner’ than others. One of the cleaner breeds is the Akita, while Frenchies are notoriously hard to potty train.”\nSmith says a dog’s breeding can  affect how easy they are to train. “To be honest, it’s about how ‘biddable’ they are, which is a direct result of how they’re bred. A Labrador is built to work alongside a human — they’ve been bred to find it rewarding to make us happy, and consequently they are easier to train. A Beagle, on the other hand, is bred to be a mile away, howling their little head off and thinking for themselves...Ideally, you want to choose a dog that thinks in a similar way to you, their parent.“\nDon’t take it to heart ifyour dog is difficult to train. All dogs are different, and all you can do is your best. Here’s Smith’s advice: “The first thing is to decrease any distraction your pup is experiencing, and to increase your reward value (for example,try cheeseinstead of a prepackaged treat)...Try to avoid giving big labels (like reactivity or separation anxiety) to pups without the insight of a professional.”\nReferences:\nA Survey of the Behavioural Characteristics of Pure-Bred Dogs in the United Kingdom",

    "page_content": "You just brought home your Christmas tree about 25 seconds ago, and the dog’s already peed on it. Sound familiar? You’re not alone. At this time of year, people start franticly asking their dog trainers how to prevent their dogs from peeing on their Christmas trees. Though we see Christmas trees as decorations, their purpose is far from clear to dogs. The good news is that most dogs (who are thoroughly house-trained) won’t pee indoors just because a tree is suddenly under their roof. But it’s good to be proactive, if you want your tree to be free of dog pee. (And who doesn’t want that?) Here are a few tips to keep your festivities in the clear.\nHow to keep your dog from peeing on a Christmas tree\nTo make sure that your tree stays dog pee free this year, there are several strategies, and your success is more likely if you take advantage of all of them. Essentially, this is a management issue. Your focus will be on preventing your dog from having an opportunity to go on the tree.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nIt’s important to get back to the basics, no matter how well your dog ishousetrainedor how many years it’s been since they had an accident — especially if it is your dog’s first experience with an indoor tree. A dog who pees on a Christmas tree is confused, not acting out. Give your dog some help by letting them know that you still want them to go outside.\nTips you’ll want to pay attention to.\nTake your dog out often on walks and in the yard. You want to provide plenty of opportunities for them to pee in the right places.\nTake your dog out often on walks and in the yard.

You’ll feel good about helping your dog avoid a mistake.\nSnow days are fun—until your pup needs to do their thing outside.\nSupervise your dog so that there is no chance for them to sneak toward the tree. Watching your pup constantly is the best way to guarantee that they will not (ahem) decorate the tree. If you cannot supervise them, then block your dog’s access to the tree withgates or other barriers. Putting a vacuum cleaner next to a tree might work for some dogs. Tethering them to you with a leash is another way to be sure you know where your dog is and what they are doing.\nBe alert to the signs that your dog may be about to go, such as sniffing or circling. Take your dog out often and reinforce them with rewards for peeing there. By the time a dog has started to lift a leg or squat, it is often too late to stop them from peeing.\nIf you do see your dog doing this by the tree, make a sound that’s loud enough to cause a startled reaction, but not so loud that it’s scary. Take them outside immediately and reinforce them for urinating outside with treats and praise. If the tree has pee on it, clean it thoroughly with anenzymatic cleanerso the area will not smell like the bathroom to your dog.\nSome plants are not so merry.\nSpend quiet time with your dog near the tree, massaging, scratching, or letting your dog chew on aKongor other chew treat so they consider the tree part of their living space. Dogs are less likely to pee in areas where they hang out or where they sleep.\nIf your dog sniffs the Christmas tree or goes near it, reinforce them for being near it but not peeing on it. Do this by teaching your dog to do something specific near the tree, such as “sit” or “lie down.” This gives them a go-to behavior to do in that area other than peeing. If they develop a positive history with a behavior other than peeing on the tree, they will be less likely to pee on it.",

      "title": "Is Your Dog a Genius? A New Study Says It’s Possible",
      "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/genius-dogs"
    },
    "page_content": "If you’ve spent time hanging out with dogs — or scrolling through your dog-crammed TikTok feed — you’ve probably already figured out that some pups are a little more clever than others. All dogs are perfect (that’s a given), but they’re not exactly equally sharp. If you have a pup with some mega-impressive brainpower, science is now backing up your claim that they might (emphasis onmight) be a legit, Matt-Damon-in-Goodwill-Hunting-level genius.\nHow researchers tested genius dogs\nThe study, published Thursday inScientific Reports, observed 41 dogs who have “a vocabulary of object labels,” also known as “Gifted Word Learner” (GWL) dogs, and quite possibly geniuses. These A students were recruited for the “Genius Dog Challenge” throughan online applicationthat asked dog parents to submit a video of their pups retrieving specific toys based on the name of the toys; the human had to stand outside of the room and ask their dog to retrieve one toy at a time out of a selection of at least three toys.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nAfter the online application, some pups were selected for an online Vocabulary Assessment Test (VAT), which repeated the original task with the presence of researchers, plus collected answers to informal, semi-structured interview questions. They eventually found 41 dogs who knew the names of at least five toys.\nYour dog might not know your name. Don’t take offense; just play this game.\nThe last step of the study was a questionnaire given to pet parents, which covered three topics with more depth: the dogs’ life history, their own experience in raising dogs, and how their dog learned the names of these toys.\nIn the end, they found that 56 percent of the dogs in the Genius Dog Challenge knew the names of at least 20 or more toys, 14 percent knew the names of 15 to 19 toys, 12 percent knew 14 to 10 toys, and 17 percent knew five to nine toys. The maximum number of toy names known by a dog was a whopping 86. Because researchers knew the dogs learned the names of toys very quickly, they later inquired, via questionnaire, whether the dogs had learned more toy names in the months following the VAT. In that questionnaire, 16 pet parents reported that their little Einsteins had learned the names of over 100 toys.\nWhat did the genius dogs have in common?\nResearchers were looking for a common thread between all these clever dogs but couldn’t quite find it. The dogs came from all walks of life, though almost all were from working breeds. Border Collies did make up 52 percent of them, but the rest were a more evenly spread mix of different breeds, including Labradors, Pomeranians, Corgis, and Australian Shepherds. The majority of the pups lived in homes with two caretakers, and 57 percent of the dogs participated in extracurricular training activities, such as obedience training, herding, and dog shows.\nCognitive Science professor Dr. Federico Rossano on how Bunny, TikTok’s “talking” dog, is sparking change in how we communicate with our pets.\nWhen it comes to the backgrounds of the pet parents, their experience varied, too. Twenty-six percent of them were first-time pet parents, 31 percent had had only one dog previously, and 34 percent had raised four or more dogs. Only three pet parents reported that a previous pet had known the names of more than three toys, and only three had a professional background in dog training.\nSo…how can you raise a genius dog?\nHere’s the twist: According to researchers, it seems like you kinda…can’t. Or rather, you can’tintentionallyraise a dog to be a genius. Three-quarters of the pet parents in the study said they initially didnottrain their dogs to learn the names of their toys; the pups started getting them on their own. Each of the pet parents said the dogs learned the names through play interactions, and 80 percent of them reported playing with their dog daily. The majority of the pet parents reported that “spontaneous learning seemed to be effortless.”\nResearchers concluded that “the owners’ training skills are likely not the primary driver behind these dogs’ skill” — if that were the case, they would find multiple GWL dogs living together. In fact, three of the pet parents adopted a puppy during the course of the study, and those dogs did not learn the names of their toys, despite them using the same play and training methods.\nSay What? A look at the types of words that dogs understand.\nSo, basically, if your pup is a genius, you should feel plenty proud, but you can't really take the credit. According to the research, their smarts seem to come pretty naturally — and randomly. That means you probably can’t teach a non-genius pup to become a genius. Though, of course, providing your pup withtons of playtime— andlots and lots of toysto learn the names of — is a good start.",

      "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/why-my-adult-dog-peeing-house"
    },
    "page_content": "Adult dogs may start peeing in the house for a variety of reasons, including health issues that must be addressed before the behavior can change. If medical causes are ruled out, potential emotional factors, such as grief or anxiety, should be considered. When house training a dog, including an adult dog who needs a refresher course, temporarily restrict the areas they can access, closely supervise them, and ensure you thoroughly and properly clean up after accidents.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nPotential causes for adult dogs peeing in the house\nToby is an eight-year-old Chihuahua we adopted when he was a year old. He was quickly house trained and never had an accident. About three years ago, we adopted an elderly dog, Coco, who turned out to be completely incontinent. We put down puppy pads and dealt with it; we knew she wouldn’t be around forever. A few weeks ago, Coco passed and now, Toby’s peeing in the house. (Or he may have been doing it for a while; while Coco was alive, we would have assumed it was her.) I can’t catch him in the act; he only does it when we aren’t home. He’s not left alone all day, and when we’re home, he’ll ask to go out. Can I retrain a middle-aged dog?It is very unsettling to suddenly realize that an adult dog seems to have lost the excellent housetraining skills you’ve taken for granted for years, and it can make anyone feel frantic to learn how to stop grown dogs from peeing in the house. Adult dogs don’t start peeing in the house for no reason, and figuring out the reason is an essential part of the solution.\nTips you’ll want to pay attention to.\nPotential causes for adult dogs peeing in the house\nIn many cases, an adult dog suddenly peeing in the house is a result of a medical issue, so it’s essential to consult with your veterinarian. A common cause of an adult dog peeing a lot, and therefore going in the house, is aurinary tract infection(UTIs).\nUTIs are more common in females than in males, which is why this health issue is one of the usual suspects when the question is, “Why is my female dog suddenly peeing in the house?”\nOther health issues that lead to an adult dog suddenly peeing in the house arekidney disease, a tumor, problemsafter being spayed(which can start to be a problem right away or even years later), separation anxiety, anddiabetes.\nSome medications make dogs extra thirsty, causing them to drink so much water they can’t hold it as long, so they go in the house. If your adult dog has started a new medication, is suddenly peeing in the house, and you are also wondering why your dog is peeing so much, schedule a visit with the veterinarian.\nAge can be a factor; it’s not unusual for older dogs to pee in the house, even though they never used to. Some dogs leak urine because their sphincter no longer has the strength to fully close and keep urine in. This is more common in older dogs but can affect dogs of other ages, too.\nDogs with painful arthritis, again more common in older dogs but not confined to those in their golden years, sometimes struggle to get up in time to make it to the potty, causing them to pee in the house. Many older dogs simply have to relieve themselves more often. If this is the issue, more frequent trips outside may stop an old dog from peeing in the house.\nOn the behavioral side, there are many reasons why adult dogs may suddenly start to pee in the house. In some cases, a dog is not really house trained, but their parent has been encouraging them to go out to pee on a regular schedule, and if the routine changes, the dog may pee inside. There are dogs who resist going outside in bad weather and end up peeing inside instead.\nThese unfortunate conditions can include extreme cold, high winds, rain, or snow. Sometimes,dogs become afraidof the yard or of peeing out there for some reason, causing them to pee inside instead. Fears can result from being outside when there’s a huge clap of thunder, stepping on something painful such as a thorn, a bee that stings them, or a person scaring them while they are out there. If the dog happens to be peeing when the scary thing happens, the dog may be comfortable in the yard in general but afraid to pee outside.\nAlthough it’s possible Toby simply needs a refresher course in where to pee, I suspect something else may be going on here. The first priority is to check for a medical issue, so an appointment with your veterinarian is in order. Sometimes, there’s a physical cause for a dog peeing in the house, with a urinary tract infection being just one possibility. A medical problem may make them need to go pee more frequently or with increased urgency, which may be why they can’t hold it as long as usual, and why there’s no problem if you’re there to let him out. It’s worth keeping track of how often Toby asks to go out when you’re home to see if he is going more frequently than normal.\nTips you’ll want to pay attention to.\nAssuming physical reasons can be ruled out, there are other potential causes. As you say, it’s possible he had this issue before, but it was masked by the natural belief that any urine inside was from Coco. It could also be a reaction to the loss of Coco;dogs grieve, too, and he may be missing her. Orseparation anxietymay have come into play. For three years, he had Coco for company when you were gone. Now, he’s truly alone in your absence, no matter how short those absences are.\nClearly, Toby needs to relearn to pee outside (and outside only) rather than inside, but if separation anxiety or physical issues are diagnosed, those need to be treated before he’ll be able to succeed. Then, it’s time to work on the house training aspect. Here are a few tips to make it easier for him to go potty where you want him to.\nHow to house train a dog\nHow youclean up after an accidentis important. What matters most is removing the odor that acts like a neon sign flashing the words “pee here!” Household cleaners may smell fresh and clean to humans — but not to dogs. Many contain ammonia, and ammonia gives off an odor that attracts dogs as if it were urine. Use an enzymatic cleaner designed to chemically neutralize the urine instead. Baking soda or club soda can do this, though not as effectively.\nDogs are less likely to pee in areas in which they spend time, so keep your dog in just one or two rooms for a while. Spending time in those areas will increase the likelihood they won’t want to pee in them. But don’t isolate them; choose the rooms that you also spend the most time in. The idea is to make those rooms their home, and that won’t work as well if you’re not there, too.\nIt’s like your 30-day yoga challenge — except with way more training treats.\nWith the scent of the whole family all around, they’re more likely to want to keep that area clean. With success, add rooms to their “home area.” Being on the floor with them will add your scent, which also makes it easier for them to grasp that these areas are out of bounds for elimination.\nWhile your dog is relearning their house training skills, it is important that they be in one of only three situations:\nOutside with you: If they’re outside, they have the opportunity to pee in the proper place. Because you’re with them, you’ll know if they’ve actually gone or just sniffed around, watched the birds, or chewed on a toy. If they do go pee, you’re right there to reinforce them with a treat, so they learn they’ve done the right thing.\nInside, under your constant supervision: Watching a dog every second for signs they need to go out is a lot of work, but it’s the best way to be alerted to their needs. Many dogs circle, sniff, head to the back door, pace, whine, head to an area they have peed in before, seem distracted, or refuse a favorite treat or toy when they need to potty.\nIf your dog lets you know when they need to go out when you’re home, this may not be necessary. However, it’s also possible they’ve gone in the house while you were home, but you didn’t notice right away and assumed it happened when you were out. I’ve heard this many times from people who didn’t realize their dogs had peed inside until they started keeping a closer eye on them.\nConfined in a small area when you are not around: When you can’t watch them,confine them to a small space, where they’re unlikely to make a mess. A crate, the laundry room, or a bathroom — any place they’re comfortable — are all options. Many dogs don’t like to be in peed-in places and are less likely to pee in a small space, especially if they sleep or rest there regularly. This doesn’t mean a dog who can’t hold it any longer or a dog who is peeing in the house because of stress will hold it, but it can encourage many dogs to do so for at least a while longer. Additionally, if a dog does pee in this area, clean-up is at least confined to a spot that is (ideally) easier to clean than other areas of the house.\nIn the early stages of house training a dog, you should not put your dog in any other situation. Once your dog has progressed and is better at peeing only where you want them to, you can consider relaxing these rules.\nFinal pieces of advice: Do not, under any circumstance, punish your dog for peeing inside the house. That can be scary and distressing and can damage both your relationship and the house training progress itself. Be patient. Remember, your dog is struggling and deserves your support, comfort, and assistance. They may be as upset about the peeing in the house as you are, or may beone of those dogs who is tricky to train.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nEnzymatic cleaners prevent the house from smelling like the bathroom, which can help stop urination indoors. Indoor puppy pads can prevent cleaning hassles.\nDogs often pee in spots that smell like urine, so if you don’t use an enzymatic cleaner to remove the odor, they will consider it the place to pee.\nBoth males and females can develop health issues such as urinary tract infections, kidney disease, or tumors, but female dogs can also suffer incontinence due to being spayed, though the issue may show up years after the procedure.",

    "page_content": "That work-from-home life is something some of us have been doing for years. The COVID-19 started nearly four years ago, and we’ve gotten used to terms like “hybrid working,” which means wedohave to leave the house sometimes. Or maybe your company wants you to be back full-time for those in-person board room meetings and Wednesday happy hours. No matter your reality, your pup doesn’t see you as much as they did for a couple years there, and it stresses them out. It’s beyond time to startseparation anxiety-training with your dog.\nWhat is separation anxiety in dogs?\nSeparation anxietyis a common behavioral disorder in dogs that occurs when a dog experiences panic or fear when they’re left alone. It can be treated with enrichment, training, and medication. It’s important to be patient and consistent because treatment can take time. If you are struggling to help your dog, consider working with a certified professional dog trainer or behaviorist.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHow does separation-anxiety training work?\nWhensomeone is scared— dogs, cats, people, you name it — you can teach them to overcome their fear by using a behavioral psychology process called systematic desensitization. Basically, you introduce the thing that is scary but at a level that is not scary.\nSo, if you want to help your dog overcome their fear, you’d first need to figure out how far away they can be from whatever is causing their fear without being scared. Let’s say that distance is 10 feet away. That means you’d start your training at 10 feet away when your dog is completely relaxed. Great. Let’s see if you can inch a little closer. Nine feet away — still no problem. Eight feet — you’re good. Seven feet —gulp! Way too close. Let’s back ’er up a bit…7.5 feet — all good. Little by little, you move closer, but only as long as your pup still feels fine. The key is controlling that distance so that they can always feel safe.\nDoes your dog freak out when you head for the door? Here’s some advice.\nUnderstanding separation anxiety in dogs\nLet’s apply this to dogs who are scared to be alone now. Pups are not dummies. They’ve figured out that every time the keys make that jingly sound or the jacket goes on, their people leave through that door, and their terror begins. They tell us they’re anxious bygiving us signals.\nDogs with separation anxiety will whimper, stiffen, yawn, lick their lips,bark, howl, jump up to the door knob, scratch and chew the door (or the frame and the floor), lose their bladders orbreak out of their cratesand cut themselves in the process.\nAll of those behaviors are rooted in fear. Notice how your dog does not do that when someone else is there? They’re scared when they’re alone, and so if you stop scaring them, the“bad” behaviorsgo away, too.\nIt’s 2023, and the office is calling. How can our dogs cope?\nHow to train a dog with separation anxiety\nRather than thinking of separation anxiety-training as something to “teach your dog that you always come back,” think of it as training to “teach your dog that nothing bad ever happens when you walk out the door.” In order to do that, you have to watch theirbody languageto control how long you are gone.\nWhen you turn your door knob, does your dog fly to the door? If so, don’t turn the door knob yet. Just walk to the door and go back and sit down. Can you open the door halfway, but all the way is too far? Fine, only open it halfway until your dog doesn’t even look up when you go to do that. Can you stand outside with the door closed for one second, but two seconds is too long? OK! Great info. Keep it under two seconds. Get the idea?\nPick one or two times a day to do 30 minutes of alone-time exercises, five to six days a week. Practice the actions leading up to leaving your dog alone to teach your pup there is nothing to fear. You’ll do this by grabbing the keys, turning the door, or walking to the door — whatever their tolerance level is. Don’t push them; ensure their body language stays positive. The goal is to show them it’s safe.\nMake sure your dog is totally relaxed before you leave again. If you leave while they're still excited about your previous return, they will be too aroused for the next trial and have less tolerance, which could make the issue worse (not better).\nIf your dog is panting, yawning, salivating, pacing, or trembling, they are too stressed for you to continue. Back up and shorten how long you leave them alone until they are relaxed again. Then continue building up their tolerance — slowly.\nAs the old saying goes, “A tired dog is a good dog. Exercising your dog’s body and mind is a good way to decrease their stress so they're less anxious when you leave the house. Make sure your dog is getting plenty of exercise, and play fun, interactive games with them.\nWe asked both animal behaviorists and human psychologists howyoucan deal with leaving your dog home alone.\nKeep training as they get better.\nAs your dog gets used to simple acts like walking to the door and touching the handle, introduce departure-related objects (keys, jackets, purse) one at a time. Mix up the training regiment with easy and more complex tasks. For example, walk to the door and turn the handle halfway; other times, grab your jacket and put on your shoes before doing so.\nTeach your dog that nothing bad ever happens when you walk out the door before anything bad does happen. Up to 55 percent of dogs worldwide exhibit some kind of separation-related problem, so why risk that happening to your dog, too? Tackle the issue before it becomes a problem.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nIt depends. If your dog feels that their crate is their safe place, then crate training should work for them. If your dog shows signs of distress in their crate, it's probably not a good idea.\nYes, hiring a dog trainer or animal behaviorist can help improve your dog's separation anxiety.\nResources:\nSeparation anxiety in dogs: What progress has been made in our understanding of the most common behavioral problems in dogs?\nSeparation anxiety in dogs: What progress has been made in our understanding of the most common behavioral problems in dogs?\nSeparation Anxiety\nSeparation Anxiety",

      "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/kids-approaching-dogs-viral-tweet"
    },
    "page_content": "The internet and trolling. It’s a relationship as symbiotic as organism and parasite. There was a time when this give-and-hot-take dynamic was mildly amusing, albeit still pretty annoying. Somebody would drop in and say something along the lines of, “Jordan could never compete in today’s NBA,” and pointless chaos would ensue. But like the sky in early December, things got dark quickly. Case in point, on the hellscape formally known as Twitter, one woman recently shared an encounter between her dog and a stranger’s child, and the discourse that followed quickly made the post go viral. Now, if you thought the split between Jordan and LeBron fans was hostile, you’ve never seen the battle between pet parents and human parents.\nSaturday night, Lynne Schmidt, under the account @AbortionChat,posted a pictureof her dog, Zoë, to X, along with a short retelling of the incident. “Small child runs up to Zoë. I body block and say, ‘Maybe we don’t run up to dogs we don’t know.’ The parent: She’s three. Me: ‘If she isn’t on voice recall, maybe she should be leashed?” the post read. As of publication, the tweet has gathered over 23 million views and 2,500 replies. Thankfully, they were all very thoughtful, constructive, and respectful (my sarcasm should be screaming through the screen at you right now).\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nTo represent the parent’s perspective, one account eloquently put it, “People >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Animals.” Another added “If she’s a danger to children in public spaces, maybe she needs to be put down?” To which I say, OOF. Worth noting that Schmidt went on to add that her dog is aservice animal.\nNaturally, pet parents were also heated. “‘She's three.’ More of a reason you should be paying attention to your child and making sure they are not running up to dogs they don’t know,” one account replied. Another took the opportunity to not only show support for the animal but reminisce. “Honestly, I think that’s a great suggestion! I was a leashed kid and that’s probably a major reason why I’m still around,” they wrote.\nThey’ll always remember their first childhood pet—this intro is just the beginning.\nOf course, others put their tin foil hats on and claimed the incident never happened at all — an increasingly common online response to anything unsettling that I do not have the patience or energy to dive into here. But what I do have time for are some tips to help human and pet parents in the real world minimize these situations and coexist peacefully on their daily trips to the park.\nAlways ask\nFor starters, parents should not let children approach strange dogs, and even dogs they have met before. “We should never assume a dog is friendly — even a dog we’ve petted or played with before,” explains Ali Smith, a dog trainer and founder ofRebarkable. “Because, like us humans, dogs have bad days or maybe feeling unwell, so always ask.”  She adds that unless they’re familiar with the animal, kids should keep their distance from any dog that is alone, even if they’re behind a fence or gate. This is in the best interest of the child, dog, and each’s parents.\nLorrie Reynolds, a trainer who runsMaximum Fun Dog Sports, adds that many dogs are frightened of children. But that doesn’t exclude pet parents from any responsibility here. “Handlers should instruct a child on how to approach their dogs, if their dogs are open to meeting children,” she says. “Otherwise, they should politely ask them to stop their approach.”\nEvery pup should have basic obedience training, including recall and simple commands like sit, before meeting children, explains Reynolds. The ideal situation is that dogs are socialized with kids when they’re young, but that is understandably not always an option, especially when you adopt.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nSmith confirms that it’s also up to the pet parents to let an approaching child know if their pup is not up for intros. “Dog guardians can intervene and say ‘hello’ and ask the child to wait there for a moment and explain if the child can or cannot pet the dog, and how is best to do so. If you want to say no, then do so,” she explains.\nMinimize risks\nNow, let’s say all parties involved are on the same page and want this meeting to go down. There are several things to keep in mind that will help everything go smoothly and minimize risks. Ivan Petersel, dog trainer founder ofDog Wizardry, warns that children can often be around the same height as dogs, which causes some confusion for the animals. An extension of that concern is the opportunity for extensive eye-to-eye contact, something dogs may view as threatening.\nAdditionally, the way adults approach new pets is usually much different than how youngsters do it. “Kids move differently than adults and are often erratic and unpredictable,” Petersel says. “This can cause the dog to react with fear, aggression, etc.” As a result, pet parents and human parents should be keeping a close eye on the dog’s body language. If they’re jumping or lunging to play with the child, then the interaction should probably be stopped. Petersel adds that pups may not immediately understand a child’s boundaries and can end up hurting kids even when they’re just being playful.\nStep one: Never put your face close to theirs.\nTake it slow\nAfter all these things are considered and an introduction seems reasonable, the most important thing is to take it slow. “Firstly, allow the dog to gently sniff the child if it feels safe and the dog’s body language is relaxed,” Petersel advises. He does not recommend, however, that the kid put their hand out. “The dog can smell your ankles, shirt, etc. No need to stick out your hand. A dog can smell a drop of blood in something that’s the size of an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Their sense of smell is incredibly strong, and there is no reason to create any risk.”\nHe says to wait until the pup is relaxing before having children gently brush their hand against the dog. Hovering above the animal is also a bad idea. Instead, let the dog slowly show them how they feel comfortable being pet and follow that lead. Reynolds adds that children should only pet them on the shoulder or side and never the head, ears, or tail.\nYou may have also noticed that none of these experts recommended the dog or child to aggressively attack one another and their beliefs on the world wide web before meeting. This is, evidently, some guidance a lot of us could all use.",

There areso manyskills and cues they need to learn, nobody can blame you. But rather than panic — often the first instinct! — make the task manageable by integrating training into daily life.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nAlways have treats.\nSchool is always in session, so be prepared to teach the right lessons. Have treats at the ready — always on you in a treat bag, in the pocket of the jacket you wear on walks, stashed around the house in containers puppy can’t reach. Professional dog trainers love to catch their dog doing something right. If their dog sits when a visitor arrives or lifts their paw in a cute way, they’ll give the dog a treat so such behaviors will be more likely to happen again. There are endless opportunities to train throughout the day when you have treats on hand.\nThe most mouth-watering treats for training your pup.\nEvery door offers a chance to practice wait.\nDogs, like people, are regularly going in and out of doors, and that presents opportunities to teach your dog to wait and to practice this important safety skill. Whenever your puppy is not in a big hurry to go through a door to go pee — going in and out of the house, the crate, and once they are big enough to do this without a lift, even the car — you can use the opportunity to train your dog to wait and to practice this skill.\nRecalls, recalls, recalls.\nReliably coming when called is one of the most important behaviors to teach any puppy. A good recall keeps dogs safe from possible danger, and a dog with a good recall can have more freedom — walking off leash, playing in fields, joining you for picnics, etc. The best way to teach a dog to come is to teach them that this cue predicts something wonderful.\nEvery time you have something your dog wants, call them to come so they become eager to respond to this cue. So many dogs respond every time to the sound of a leash (a walk is about to happen — yay!) and to the sound of a treat bag crinkling (I’m about to get a treat — yay!). Training a reliable recall is about harnessing those same good feelings and associating them with the cue to come. If you say “come” before giving your puppy something they love, such as a toy or chew, or before going outside with them, or before giving them abelly rub, or playing a game of chase with them, your dog willwantto respond to this cue by running right to you.\n“Sit” is a good habit.\nMost dogs quicklylearn that sittingis a good default behavior when they want something; understanding with a bit of practice that if they sit, they get the same good results as if they said “please.” Teach them to sit as a habit before receiving their breakfast or dinner (and lunch, too!), before you put on a leash, and when you get to the edge of a curb on walks.\nReinforce every potty success.\nYou need to know if your dog has gone pee or poop, so they can come back in the house, have a rest in their crate, or come in the car with you without creating a cleaning challenge. Just because they are outside does not mean they have gone potty, so you must watch to know for sure. That means you need to be outside with them, supervising their activity and watching whether or not they go. Make good use of your time outside by giving them treats after every potty time. That’s how you let them know they’ve done the right thing by pooping or peeing in the yard or on a walk, and how you can make every bathroom event a training success.\nUse their name to get their attention.\nGetting your dog’s attention isveryimportant, so it’s useful to train your dog to look at you when you say their name. (You can train a dog to do anything if youhave their attention, but without it, everything is whole lot harder.) Say your dog’s name, and if they look at you, give them a treat. If you have treats in your pocket, you can do this any time you and your puppy are together, making it easy to integrate into your day.\n“Four on the floor” during greetings.\nWhenever you come home, offer them a treat and some attention for keeping all four paws on the floor. Far too many dogs jump up and become unpopular with guests because they leave paw prints, tear clothes, and hurt or frighten someone. They will seem more unruly than sweet no matter how friendly they are. Make it easier on your dog and yourself by teaching them from the beginning that every time they greet you, they will get treats and attention if all four paws are on the floor. If you prefer for your dog to sit in this context, then reinforce them for sitting during greetings.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nMake hanging out fun.\nTeach them to go to their bed, onto a mat, or in their crate when you are eating dinner, need to get some work done, or are otherwise going to be occupied and unable to attend to them. Make it a positive experience for them by giving them something fun to do. If they receive astuffed Kongor a puppy-safe chew toy, they will be happy and busy. The training lesson that it’s fun to be in that spot even if their person is doing something else is a valuable one for puppies to learn.\nCheck-ins on walks.\nTrain your puppy to check in with you on walks by using treats to reinforce the behavior of coming over to you. Puppies are often distracted on walks by all the sights, sounds, and smells of the great outdoors, and they will become more distracted as they approach andenter adolescence. If you can teach your puppy that it’s worth it to come over to you even during the fun of a walk, you are helping them create a lifelong habit. Receiving treats on walks, as a reward for checking in, teaches dogs to pay attention to you.\nPlay offers more than just fun.\nHopefully, one of the top reasons you love having a puppy is because of the playtime you get to have together. (It’s not the new sleep schedule, that’s for sure!). Playing with toys is fun, as well as a great way to teach your dog useful skills. Teaching your dog to take something and to drop it on cue is a natural fit for the game of tug. When you play, tell your dog to take it and offer the toy, perhaps waving it around a bit or dragging it along the floor. When they do take hold of it in their mouth, reinforce that behavior by playing tug with them.\nAfter a brief session, tell them to “drop it,” put a treat by their nose, and when they let go, give them the treat, and then start a new game of tug after telling them to take it. You can repeat this multiple times so they get to play when they take it, and they get a treat when they drop it, but “drop it” doesn’t always mean the end of the play session.\nFor some dogs, it’s not as simple as just throwing a ball.\nFetch can also helpdogs learn to drop it, especially if you play with multiple balls. You can train a “drop it” skill by showing them a second ball while they are holding one; this makes many dogs drop the one in their mouths in anticipation of another ball being thrown. Make sure to throw your ball as soon as they drop the one in their mouth so they are promptly reinforced for dropping it. Dogs who get plenty of playtime are less likely to seek and destroy other objects in the house.\nHeeling here, there, and everywhere.\nIncorporating aheeling practiceinto your day means reinforcing your dog for walking next to you when you are walking anyway. That means you can do it when you walk around the house, whether you are headed to the bathroom, to the other room to grab a book, or to the kitchen for a snack. Just a few seconds of walking by your side and receiving treats done a few times a day is enough to get a great head start on heeling. I also recommend doing this on walks for 10 to 15 seconds at a time a couple of times during each walk, offering treats generously for being in the right place by your side.\nA few structured training sessions.\nThere are some skills that are not so easily integrated into daily life, so the trick is figuring out a way to integrate some structured training sessions into your day. These sessions are essential for training skills that don’t come up as naturally. Training your dog to leave it so they don’t eat something gross, dangerous, or valuable off the floor is easier to do in a planned way in the early stages.\nTeaching your dog to touch a target or to do tricks — such as shake or roll over — or to stay are all best taught in sessions dedicated to training. Find a way to put small training sessions into your day: This can be during TV commercials, when you are waiting for your leftovers to reheat or your toast to pop up, or even when your roommate or partner gets in the shower first and you are waiting for your turn. Whenever your daily life leaves you with a brief pause, that’s a time you can train your dog. So, keep those little pauses in mind, and do your best to take advantage of them.\nThis study says it’s actually less about what’sintheir DNA and more about what’sonit.\nIntegrating lots of the training into daily life makes it easier to manage and not so overwhelming. Integrated training also follows the principle that the best training for dogs — especially puppies — is done in really short sessions. Most people think of five minutes as short, but when dog trainers refer to short sessions, they often mean 30 seconds or even less. Finally, dog training is more fun and feels less like work when it’s just a part of your day rather than a big task waiting to be done. And with puppies, fun is what it’sallabout.",

    "page_content": "Shortly after we were married, my husband and I spent the holidays with my in-laws, and we brought our young dog, Bugsy. He was social, had an excellent “stay,” came when called, had no history of food thievery, and wouldn’t dream of lifting his leg indoors (even on a tree), so my confidence in his visiting skills was high.\nOn arrival, as he occupied himself with a stuffedKongso we could unpack the car, a possible problem occurred to me. Bugsy often tossed his Kong into the air and ate any treats that flew out of it. In our poor students’ apartment, it was endearing, entertaining behavior. But my in-laws’ decor included crystal, collectible figurines, and an array of china teacups. Racing into the house in a panic, I caught the Kong in midair as it flew toward a set of porcelain miniatures. As I breathed a sigh of relief, it occurred to me that perhaps I had been a bit smug in thinking the trip would be stress-free.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThis time of year generates tales of woe associated with bringing dogs to visit friends and relatives — whether your pup howls because they don’t have a seat at the dinner table or they get thezoomiesat your in-laws’ tiny apartment. Whether or not people fully anticipate the trouble that awaits them, taking a dog into someone else’s home for the holidays can cause major stress. The best approach for assuaging this seasonal angst is two-pronged: Prepare your dog as much as you can ahead of time with the skills they’ll need to succeed during the visit, and make every effort to avoid other situations for which they haven’t prepared.\nDo these things to help your pup (and your guests) feel chill.\nFirst, get permission to bring your pet\nThe preliminary step, of course, is to request permission to bring your pet along. Not everyone wants your pup to visit, no matter how well-mannered they are. Even dog lovers appreciate the advance warning that allows them to, for example, put away the fragile vase on display at the precise height of the perpetually swinging tail of your cheerful Great Dane. If your dog is not welcome, don’t bring them, or find somewhere else to stay. The strain of a visit with an unwelcome dog can permanently damage relationships. Plus, it’s hard on the dog to be \"Undesirable Number One\" in an otherwise festive home.\nBrush up on basic commands (and fun tricks)\nTraining is a critical aspect of preparation:. The better trained your dog is, the more welcome you will both be as guests. The key skills are to be able to sit, stay, come, leave it, greet politely, andstop barking on cue. It sounds like a long list, but these are also the basics of polite canine citizenship. I also recommend that you teach your dog at least one “show-off” behavior. This can be waiting at the door until told to proceed (easy to teach but impressive to most people) or a trick such as “roll over” or “high five.” Anything that makes your dog more charming will help ease tensions in case of a social gaffe. For example, I had a client whose dog jumped up on her father-in-law, but was forgiven immediately when she gave the cue, “you goofed,” and the dog responded by lying down and covering his face with his paws, as though in embarrassment.\nYoucanlive in a quiet house again.\nNip bad behavior in the bud\nCommon host complaints include barking,jumping up on visitors, andstealing food. Of course, if your pup is prone to more serious transgressions such asbiting, destructive chewing, or house-soiling, it is unfair to expect your dog and your hosts to co-exist peacefully, and it may be best not to go a-visiting with them in tow.\nTeach your dog the skills they’ll need to be a gracious guest. If your pup is a barker, teach them to stop on cue. Say “enough” the instant they start to bark, and then puttreatsright by their nose. Do not let them have the treats until they stop barking. Many dogs quickly learn that quieting down when you say “enough” is a way to get treats. If your pup jumps up on people, teach them that if they do this, the humans will leave. But if they sit, they will get treats and attention. Since the majority of jumpers do so out of an urge to be social, they quickly learn that jumping up makes people go away. They choose to sit instead, which results in the opportunity to socialize, and results in treats as well.\nBring toys and treats to keep them entertained\nEven if you prepare ahead of time, there’s plenty to do during your visit to make sure that the holiday is remembered as a fun one rather than as the last family holiday to which you were allowed to bring your dog.Exercise, chews, interactive toys, andpuzzlescan minimize behavioral issues such asdestructive chewingand counter-surfing, which tend to worsen when dogs are bored or full of pent-up energy. Bring acrateif your dog likes it and your hosts have enough space. Help clean up, especially if the mess involves dog hair or sloppy drinking at the water bowl. Seize the opportunity to put leftovers out of your dog’s reach, and volunteer to take out the trash.\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nRun through a training drill on arrival\nAs soon as possible after you arrive, practice the skills your dog already knows so that they can learn to do them in new places, too. One of the things that separates professional trainers from novices is that professionals know that training doesn’t automatically transfer to new locations. For example, just because your dog has a rock-solid stay in your living room, doesn’t mean they know how to respond in the same way in your yard, at the park, or at Grandma’s house. Even a couple of five-minute training sessions can significantly improve your dog’s performance and manners.\nObedience skills aren’t the only ones that may drop off at a guest’s house: Many dogs who are completely trustworthy when left at home alone are stressed, scared, or mischievous when left alone in a new place, all of which can result in house-soiling or the aforementioned destructive chewing or counter-surfing. The change in routine, a new place and additional people may also make dogs more likely to exhibit these unwanted behaviors. Adjust your plans — and expectations — accordingly.\nSet your dog up for success\nPup faux pas may occur, but focusing on prevention will help your dog succeed. Don’t set up your highly food-motivated dog to fail by leaving them alone, even for a minute, while the turkey is on the table. If you know your dog has a tendency to find food or shoes, don’t put temptation in their way. Make some areas of the house off limits, or use a crate, baby gate, orpuppy penso that your dog never gets the opportunity to display anything but their best behavior.\nNo matter how things go, send a thank you note to your hosts to express your gratitude that you and your dog were welcomed into their home (and, if necessary, to apologize). With thoughtful preparation, you can prevent a major pup holiday meltdown.",

If your pup is a social butterfly who wants to goof around with every dog they meet and enjoys play sessions, even when multiple dogs are involved, they will probably find daycare a positive experience. If they are not familiar with multi-dog play, it’s wise to give them opportunities to play in a group setting, starting with small groups and moving on to larger groups, assuming they're enjoy it.\nDoggie daycare is not the place to teach a dog to like strangers or to be comfortable with other dogs. Imagine trying to change a socially anxious person who is shy and introverted into a social butterfly by sending them to a huge party with dozens or hundreds of people and loud music. That’s a good analogy for trying to teach a dog to be more social by sending them to doggie daycare. It’s just too intense and will likely be a negative experience that could actually make them less social.\nWork onyour dog’s recallso they will come when a daycare staff member calls them; this is important because they may need to call your pup away from potentially problematic situations. I also recommend teaching them to sit when they greet people and to walk nicely on a leash so the staff members will enjoy their interactions with your dog.\nDon’t let your new dogwalk you.\nTeach your dog to be comfortable in a crate if the daycare facility uses them. Many daycares have dogs spend some time playing in groups and some time on breaks, resting in crates.\nBefore your dog attends doggie daycare without you, familiarize them with the actual facility. Pop in for a quick meet-and-greet with the staff and a walk-around, so the sights, sounds, and smells are not a shock to them the first time you leave them there.\nWhen you do take your dog there for their first day, leave them for only an hour or so, even if you must pay for the whole day. It’s far better to leave them wanting more than for them to become overwhelmed and exhausted by being active — and awake, quite frankly — for so long. If that experience is a good one and your dog seems happy (based on what you observe and what the staff tells you), the next step is for them to spend a few hours there, and then if that goes well, to spend the whole day there.\nKeep in mind that not every dog enjoys doggie daycare — and that’s OK. Some dogs find it overwhelming — more like a schoolyard fight than a party. Other dogs exhibit such high levels of arousal that they are incapable of being their best selves. Dogs can sometimes be trained to handle the situation better, but often, if they’re scared or get too revved up, they may simply not be good candidates for spending all day with a large group of dogs. If this proves to be the case with your dog, understand that it’s not a failing on their part; it’s all about the dog and their particular personality and needs.\nDoggie daycare is great for many dogs, but it can be a negative experience for others. Communicate with daycare staff to provide information about your dog's behavior, preferences, and any special needs, and only keep sending your dog to doggie daycare if it is working out for your dog. It can be a challenge to answer the question, “How do I know if my dog likes daycare?” but it helps to observe your dog when you arrive to see if they are eager to be there or not, and also to watch your dog’s body language at daycare to determine if they are relaxed, comfortable, and happy. If they look fearful or show signs of stress, they are presumably not a dog who likes the doggie daycare experience they have been having.Choosing a high-quality doggie daycarethat suits your dog is an important way to increase the chances of a positive experience for your dog.\nEverything you need to know to get your new addition off to a good start.\nWhat are the pros and cons of doggie daycare?\nThere are pros and cons to doggie daycare, and it’s important to evaluate on a regular basis whether the pros outweigh the cons for your dog. On the pro side, doggie daycare offers your dog the chance to have a fun, stimulating day rather than being home alone when you are at work. The opportunity to play, to be around people and dogs, and to go to a place other than home benefits many dogs. Doggie day care offers plenty of enrichment, and they will probably be tired when you come home, so you can rest and relax rather than be the recreation director all evening.\nOn the downside, some dogs find doggie daycare stressful and upsetting. They may become overly aroused with all the stimulation and may become crabby and defensive because they need more space and time to relax on their own. Bad experiences at daycare make some dogs less able to handle other dogs. Others become so excitable around other dogs that they act in inappropriate ways, such as leaping on them and generally being rude whenever they see a dog.\nDoggie daycare, puppies, and socialization\nIf you’re wondering whether doggie daycare is good for socializing your puppy, that’s a hard no. Socialization is exposing a puppy to a variety of new experiences (positive ones!) during the critical period of their lives from three to 14 weeks and only applies to puppies. Most doggie daycares will not accept a puppy who is younger than four months old (which is too old to still be in their socialization stage).\nThat is good because there is too high a chance of a bad experience in a dog’s early weeks that could have long-term effects. This is the same reason puppies, especially young ones, should not go to dog parks. If clients ask me when a puppy can go to daycare, my answer is that they probably shouldn’t go untilthey are in late adolescence.Though some facilities with small groups monitored constantly by knowledgeable staff create good experiences for young dogs, there’s always a risk of a bad experience negatively affecting them.\nHow to prepare your dog for a dog walker\nTo prepare your dog for a dog walker requires teaching your dog to be comfortable with every aspect of the experience and to be polite and easily manageable during walks. Specifically, the advance preparation for dog walkers means teaching your dog to be an enjoyable dog to walk withgood leash mannersand good social skills.\nFor starters, it prevents escape, works as a training tool, and is recommended by rescue workers.\nTo prepare your dog to be walked by a professional dog walker, make sure they are accustomed to the gear the dog walker uses. It’s important that they’re walked using a familiar, safe, and comfortableleash (and collar or harness)that also works for the dog walker.\nDog walkers greatly appreciate if pups have been taught to remain calm while the collar or harness is put on and/or their leash is being attached, whether that means a dog sits or simply stands still. If your dog has a tendency to pull, teach them to walk nicely on a leash, which will make it more likely that your dog and the dog walker will have positive experiences during their outings.\nFinally, it’s important to make sure that your dog will be comfortable with a dog walker entering your home. Many dogs are happy when anybody comes over at any time. If this describes your dog, great! If that’s not the case and your dog isuncomfortable with a strangerwalking in when they’re home alone, set up situations in which people come overwhile you are thereand toss treats or toys to help your dog feel happy about visitors.\nOnce people are not strangers to them, your dog will be better able to handle them entering when you are not there. If you’re concerned that your dog might act aggressively to a visitor or be really nervous around them, consult with a canine behaviorist who can help your dog with this issue.\nFind one they love, but not so much they won’t wanna come home.\nWhat are the pros and cons of dog walkers?\nGenerally, the pros of dog walkers are that your dog gets out for some fun and exercise. The cons are that you are trusting someone else to keep your dog safe and happy. That’s only possible if the person has the experience to understand your dog’s emotions and behaviors and act accordingly. Not every dog is a good match for dog walking services. If your dog is fearful of strangers or highly reactive to other dogs, consider contacting aprofessional behaviorist or trainerwho is qualified to address these issues.\nThey’ll be able to help improve the situation and let you know if and when your dog is ready to go on walks with a dog walker. If your dog is easy going and agreeable on walks no matter what they encounter, and doesn’t have any alarming habits such as slipping out of their collar or trying to run away, a wide variety of responsible dog walkers will be a good match. If your dog is aggressive, reactive, fearful, or a skilled escape artist, then only a dog walker who specializes in handling these issues will be appropriate to consider hiring to walk your dog. But definitely do your research: Even that is no guarantee that the benefits will outweigh the costs.\nAnd why you shouldn’t skip the longer routes.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nIn addition to communication from the staff about your dog, monitor their progress by observing their body language at drop-off and pick-up  and when they see their dog walker.\nLet the doggie daycare or dog walker know what your dog loves, what might upset your dog, what cues they know, and if they have any health issues including allergies.",

    },
    "page_content": "If there’s one thing we’ve learned over the past few years, it’s the importance of wearing a mask. Just as we’ve spent nearly three years combating misinformation and ignorance around face masks, many pet parents have been stuck in a similar loop for much longer when it comes to muzzles.\nThey know all too well the benefits of letting their dogs rock a Bane fit while enduring the negative stereotypes associated with looking like one of theBatmanfranchise’s most infamous villains. One organization has been working to ease some of that stress and teach other dog owners and bystanders not to fear muzzles — but instead celebrate them.The Muzzle Up! Projectis a San Francisco-based advocacy, training, and education servicefighting stigmasagainst dog parents who muzzle their pets.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nBeyond the Muzzle\nThe group was started in 2013 by Maureen Backman, a private dog trainer at the time, who had her ambitions set on altering common misconceptions about muzzle use.\n“I remember as a new baby dog trainer seeing her posts and being so in love with the message she was sending, Sarah McManaman, director of operations at The Muzzle Up! Project, says. “There was always a big emphasis on empowering dogs and working together as a team. I really appreciated having that be one of my influences.”\nBackman founded the organization hoping to normalize muzzle use and offer training without judgment. While she would eventually leave the Muzzle Up! Project to focus on a career in human therapy, her mission, and the collaborative ethos she established remain.\nMuzzle Up partners with trainers and rescues across the U.S. to alleviate fears about muzzling pups and help demonstrate how best to use them. The training tool has been historically misunderstood as merely a safeguard against biting, ultimately resulting in the  assumption that any dog wearing one is dangerous.\nNow, this concept isn’t entirely difficult to understand. If you saw someone walking around the park wearing a Hannibal Lecter mask, you’d probably cross the street, too. But with dogs, there are plenty of reasons unrelated to protecting flesh that one might wear a muzzle.\n“Yes, muzzles do help prevent bites. But they also help dogs with certain medical conditions like PICA, where they compulsively want to eat non-food items,” McManaman explains.\nShe also notes that muzzles also help keep vet staffs safe; a panicked dog or one that is in pain is more likely to bite, even if it’s out of character. While it might be unlikely, a dog who is severely injured can lash out in an attempt to protect themself from further pain. If your dog understands how to properly wear a muzzle and is comfortable doing so, it’s less stressful for you and prevents a potentially terrible situation.\nEducate, Educate, Educate\nOf course, Muzzle Up doesn’t condemn those who are unaware of all the reasons why someone might muzzle their dog. Instead, the team sees it as an opportunity for some polite teaching.\n“I feel like most people who are unaware of all the reasons someone may muzzle their dog assume that a muzzled dog must be a dangerous dog. We were all that person at one point, so when someone is questioning why your dog is muzzled or making assumptions that is an opportunity to gently educate,” says McManaman.\nThe online discourse around muzzles has become a major challenge for The Muzzle Up! Project’s mission — even from those who support it.\n“A lot of what I do involves watching what goes on online in the dog world surrounding muzzles, dog ownership, and dog training. People post what they are doing or how they are training, and then the comment section is just everyone fighting amongst one another. Criticism leads to defensiveness, and someone who is defensive is not receptive to any information being provided,” McManaman explains, before advising that kindness is the best way to advocate for fearful or aggressive dogs and the use of muzzles.\nShe adds: “We were all once a person who didn’t know about muzzles and assumed that they were only for aggressive dogs or that a muzzled dog has an awful life. We know that those things aren’t true so we need to lead by example,” she implores.\nHelp Beat the Stigma\nMcManaman practices what she preaches with her own pets. Neither of her dogs technically need to be muzzled but both have experience with the training for the device. “Why? Because all dogs can benefit from having been conditioned to wear a muzzle,” she explains. “There are so many uses beyond just aggression that responsible dog ownership also includes proactively training your dog to wear a muzzle.“\nPlus, one of her two pups is a Pit Bull and Rottweiler mix — giving McManaman a unique insight into one of the more complex muzzle battles.\n“I think Pit Bull owners have a harder time coming to terms with muzzling their dog. They are already having to deal with the stigma of the breed and a lot of people who talk to me don’t want to muzzle their bully breeds out of fear that they may look mean or dangerous,” she explains. Thanks to decadesof poor media representationresulting in negative public perceptions, Pit Bulls have long faced breed discrimination.\nFor Pittie owners, McManaman recommends fighting the urge to protect your dog’s image in favor of allowing them the convenience of looking like NBA player Richard Hamilton. “Let’s make one thing clear: Muzzles are for all breeds. Every dog can benefit from muzzle training and every dog has the propensity to bite,” she states.\nIf you want to get involved with Muzzle Up and support its mission, McManaman says there are few things more impactful and encouraging than using your own voice and platform: “Every time you post a video of your dog enjoying their day while wearing a muzzle, even if that only impacts one person, you are headed in the right direction. People need to see that muzzled dogs are happy, fulfilled, and living their best lives. The only way they are going to see that is if people are putting out the videos and pictures of that happening.”",

    "page_content": "Ready to train your new dog and wondering where to start? Google “dog training” — actually, please don’t — and the opinions are as endless as they are confusing. One thing is certain: Learning to communicate in a way that matches how your dog learns best is what makes everything else work.\nThat’s where “clicker training” comes in. If you’re feeling you somehow missed the memo on the magic of clickers, don’t freak out. You’re in good company with most dog parents. Here’s a simple guide to clicker training and why every trainer swears by it.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nAlmostallnew puppy parents fall at the first hurdle. Here, pro tips on picking yourself up.\nFirst, what’s a clicker?\nAlmost deceptively simple, a clicker is a cricket-like noisemaker that fits in the palm of your hand. It’s super inexpensive at under $5, but it punches way above its weight as a tool to help turn you and your dog into training wizards. When you press the button on the clicker, you hear a “click” sound, hence the name.\nThe click is used to mark theexactmoment your dog has done something correctly, and the sound is always followed by reinforcement — usually a treat. Your dog learns the sound of the click predicts the treat, and the good behavior that happened at that instant becomes burned into your dog’s treat-loving, you-pleasing brain.\nIt’s important to remember that dogs are individuals, so training isn’t one-size-fits-all.\nWhy can’t I just give my dog a treat when they learn a cue?\nGreat question. Because a clicker gives your dog’s brain the timing precision and clarity it needs. No offense, but your timing is probably off. Dogs require immediatefeedback to learn. You may intend to give your dog a treat when they sit, for example, but actually deliver it when they stand up after sitting rather than at the precise moment their butt hits the ground, and that can be confusing to your dog’s literal mind. The click is a way for you to precisely and clearly let your dog know the exact good behavior that made the precious treat appear.\nA clicker also makes it possible to communicate successfully with your dog when you aren’t right next to each other. For example, if you’re calling your dog to you, the goal is to click when your pup starts movement toward you and deliver the treat on arrival. Or, if you’re asking your dog to “stay” at a distance, you can click from afar when the stay starts and go to your dog to deliver the reinforcing treat.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nHow does clicker training differ from other training methods?\nClicker training is also referred to as “marker” training and is a form ofpositive reinforcementor reward-based training. It’s rooted in behavioral science and evidence-based methodology that relies on teaching dogs what we want them to do, reinforcing desirable behaviors for more effective learning, and bonding with you instead of correcting or punishing “bad” behavior.\nHow can I start clicker training my dog?\nFirst, you want to teach your dog what the clicker means: that hearing that sound is the best thing ever. This is called “charging the marker” and here’s how it’s done:\nHave a handful of small treats in one hand and your clicker in the other. Click. Pause. Give your dog a treat. Repeat until the treats are gone. You aren’t asking for any behaviors. Your dog is simply learning that the click sound equals treat.\nHave a handful of small treats in one hand and your clicker in the other. Click. Pause. Give your dog a treat.

The click is only meaningful because it predicts reinforcement. So, no matter how many times you’ve clicked and treated before for the same behavior, if you click, you treat. If you stop treating after you click, the click will lose efficacy as a conditioned reinforcer (which means when dogs hear it, they know they did what their human wanted). You can eventually stop clicking and just offer a treat (or other type of life reward) when your dog is able to perform the desired behaviors in all sorts of settings — home, a busy park, a trail, store, etc. Until then, keep clicking and treating.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nCan I use the clicker to get my dog’s attention?\nNope. The clicker is not an attention-getting device. It is there to communicate the moment your dog (or cat or chicken — yes, everyone loves a good click) does something right. Dogs are geniuses at doing what works for them.Have fun using your clicker to make your dog’s good behavior and life skills work for both of you.",

    },
    "page_content": "As kids, we were taught to ask permission before petting a dog with some variation of “May I please meet your dog?” As adults, we have T-shirts and hats that say, “Tell your dog I said ‘hi.’” But when did we start thinking it was OK to excitedly approach a dog with a big ol’ pet on the head, sans warning?\nDo we, as humans, especially after years of social distancing, love a non-consensual pat on the head (seriously, who would do that?) or hug? No. We like to be asked. And so do dog parents who are out in public with their pups.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nRead Between the Lines\nThis simple question has the potential to avoid unpleasant interactions, but only if kids (and adults) are taught how to interpret the possible answers, especially those that are nuanced. The answer might be a simple “Yes.” It could also be a straightforward “No“ for any number of reasons: It’s not safe to pet the dog, the dog will feel uncomfortable if the child attempts to interact, or even that someone is on a tight schedule and doesn’t have time for a meet-and-greet. The person may also seem hesitant but not actually say “No” or give an answer that conveys serious concern.The clear “Yes” answers are easy to figure out. It’s common for people to reply to a request to meet a dog with some variant of “Sure, she loves people!” “He would love that!” or “Absolutely; thanks for asking!” In that case, there is a good chance that the person expects a positive interaction between a person and a dog. They might be wrong, but there’s no sense of worry or concern being expressed, which is encouraging, and it makes sense for people to approach the dog.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nSimilarly, a definite “No” from the person is also clear. If a person declines the request, people should respect that and not approach the dog. Common ways that people prevent an interaction are by saying, “I’m sorry, but people make her nervous,” “She’s too shy; it will upset her,” or “I think maybe no, because everything scares her.” They might even say, “No, because she’ll try to bite you.” People who answer in this general way know that the dog can’t handle it and that it would be a mistake to let someone meet her.\nUnfortunately, there are two general categories of answers that can be ambiguous, and too few children have been taught to understand them. The first set of such answers is generally positive with mild reservations. These usually indicate that the people are not concerned about their dog being aggressive, but they feel embarrassed about some aspect of their dog. These replies are along the lines of, “OK, but she’s very excitable,” or “Yes, but she may jump on you.”\nSometimes, people just offer a warning that is not behavioral, such as “If you don’t mind getting a lot of fur on you!” In most cases, these responses are not deal breakers. If the person expresses that their dog is unruly or shedding, it’s OK to answer, “I don’t mind dog hair,” or “I don’t think jumping up will put a dark blot on her character!” Just consider whether the dog is not so powerful or out of control that someone could get knocked over. This requires a judgment call, and the most conservative approach is to choose not to meet dogs after such replies. At the very least, proceed with caution.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a shy pup to go from wallflower to social butterfly.\nAnother set of answers can be more worrisome, and people need to learn that they should not pet a dog if the dog’s parent says things along the lines of, “That wouldprobablybe OK,” or “Well, she’s shy, but we can see how she does,” or “If she’ll let you. I’m not sure because sometimes she can’t handle it.” All of these replies show that a person is in the hope-and-fear zone. (“I hope it will be OK, but I fear that it will not be.”) There is a great risk that the interaction could not end well for the person or the dog.\nGood Rules of Thumb\nKids, who can often scare dogs, should be taught that the correct action upon hearing such remarks is not to approach the dog. A simple, “Oh, that’s OK. I wouldn’t want to upset her, but thanks anyway,” is a good phrase to use in those situations.There are endless possible answers when a person asks, “May I please meet your dog?” The “Yes” and the “No” replies are easy to understand. The former tells you it’s likely to be a positive interaction and the latter lets you know that the person knows the dog can’t handle it and has clearly said so. It’s those intermediate answers that require more careful interpretation. If the answer gives any hint that it might not go well or might distress the dog, it’s best to decline.\nWith patience and positive reinforcement, you can do a lot to make up for lost time with socialization.\nOf course, all of this general advice assumes that people have the right read on their dog, and that is not always the case. They may think the dog loves all people, even when the dog’s body language reveals that they are terrified and wants someone to go away. That’s why it’s still important for passersby to learn how to tell that a dog is behaving in a fearful and/or threatening way.\nDog parents’ responses to a request to meet a dog are only one stream of information we can use to decide whether to approach a dog. Still, there’s often a lot of truth in what they say, which is why we should evaluate those responses and act accordingly.",

    },
    "page_content": "Whether you’ve had a dog for years or recently brought home a new puppy, chances are your dog encounters other dogs pretty frequently. While we humans may greet each other with a head nod or hello, dogs have a far more complex way of greeting one another.\nWhat are dog greetings, exactly? Dogs are intensely social creatures, and while it’s not possible to say what canine greetings are actually for — they have not been studied enough — it’s likely that they serve more than a single purpose. Greetings between dogs serve a lot of functions, from reducing uncertainty, fear, and arousal to gathering information. They can be used to signal status, increase tolerance for being in close proximity to one another, and aid with conflict resolution and reconciliation.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThe function of greetings between dogs who are familiar with one another and those who have never met are likely not the same. Between unfamiliar dogs, the goal of a dog-to-dog introduction is probably to assess one another:Are you a male or a female? Intact or altered? Where have you been? How old are you? Do you like to play? Are you friendly? Sociable? Well-mannered? Are you someone I want to interact with?On the other hand, dogs who know each other well have less to learn, which means their greetings are more likely about continuing the relationship and expressing emotions about the reunion.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a shy pup to go from wallflower to social butterfly.\nWhat do appropriate dog greetings look like?\nDespite some variations, the basics tend to be the same. Dogs move toward each other in a calm and relaxed way, often approaching from the side or along an arc rather than head-on. Sniffing is a huge part of the process, and dogs may take an interest in any area with glands, pheromones or other scents. They might touch noses first, then move on to sniff the anogenital region, or they might start their investigation at the back end of the other dog. According to Dr. John Bradshaw, PhD, males typically sniff the area under the tail right away, while most females initially go for the head.\nIf the greeting is going well, the dogs’ bodies will be relaxed. Their tails might be moving and have a flexible look; their ears arenot pulled backand their jaws will be relaxed as well. Both dogs should be visibly comfortable with the interaction rather than anxious or afraid.\nIt’s common for dogs to part ways after a short greeting. Dr. Camille Ward, PhD, studied greetings at a dog park (excluding the initial entries, which often involved a mob scene) amongst 52 dogs and found that they were surprisingly brief — typically six to eight seconds, with dogs going their separate ways after this fleeting interaction. The shortness of the greetings was not the only surprise in the study; Dr. Ward also found that only 12 percent of greetings progressed to play. This suggests that (a) when dogs are free to choose, they greet and move on quickly and (b) play is not nearly as likely an outcome of greetings as you might think.\nThey’re not exactly crafting friendship bracelets for each other, but dog bondsmeansomething.\nSome dogs don’t engage in greeting behavior at all — and that’s okay. Dr. Ward, who saw no aggression during this study, found that more than 80 percent of the greetings were unreciprocated. (When dogs were of similar weight, it was more likely that the greeting would be reciprocal.) If your dog isn’t interested in greeting another dog, it’s best to honor their choice (rather than try to force them to say hello).\nWhat do problematic dog greetings look like?\nThere are many signs that a greeting is not going well. A dog may make a beeline for, rush at, or jump on the other dog, which is not only bad manners but can also overwhelm or frighten the dog who’s being charged.\nSigns that trouble is brewing include tension anywhere in a dog’s body, facial expressions indicating anxiety, fear or other negative emotions, and/or a tail that is slowly twitching at the tip or stiff or tucked under the body. If a dog lays their head or paw over the top of another dog’s shoulders, that is considered very pushy, making it an inappropriate greeting behavior. Intense staring, another definite no-no, is a behavior that goes beyond rude straight into threatening.\nYelping or other high-pitched vocalizations usually indicate that a dog is upset and not enjoying the interaction. Leaping up, muzzle punching, growling and, of course, biting fall far outside the bounds of acceptable greeting behavior. If one dog sniffs but refuses to let the other dog sniff back, tension may result, and that can lead to trouble.\nChange is hard, but that doesn’t mean you should feel bad.\nWhile dog introductions can go awry because of canine social faux pas, humans sometimes inadvertently make things worse by: tensing up, holding our breath or displaying other signs of nervousness; standing still (which forces the dogs into a prolonged interaction), crowding the dogs, tightening up on the leash, insisting that the dogs work it out, speaking in harsh or anxious tones, or punishing the dogs.\nDogs are sensitive to your behavior and body language, so if you’re nearby when they are in a tense situation, what you do affects them. Do your best to alleviate the tension instead of adding to it. Stay calm and speak in happy, lighthearted tones, perhaps saying something simple like, “This way!” in an upbeat manner, and then moving away from the other dog. Keep walking if possible, and encourage your dog to move, too. Moving often disrupts the intensity of a greeting that is not going well because it allows the dogs to disengage from the interaction.\nHow do you introduce dogs properly?\nGreetings are most likely to go well when dogs do not feel trapped, so if possible, introduce the dogs off-leash. When dogs are on-leash, the greeting is not on their terms because they are being forced to be close to each other and lack the freedom to move away. If having the dogs greet off-leash is not possible, the next best thing is to keep the leashes loose. Dropping the leashes is sometimes an option, too.\nWouldyouwant a stranger coming right up to your face?\nIdeally, dog meetings should take place in an open space rather than a confined area, which allows the dogs room to move and get away if they choose. Being outdoors also gives dogs the “pee-and-flee” option.\nIn a study of olfactory investigation and urination at a dog park, Dr. Anneke Lisberg, PhD, noticed a strong tendency of entering dogs to walk or run away from the dogs swarming them at the gate, and then urinate once they were at a distance. Often, the other dogs would investigate the urine, which gave the new dog some breathing room. Dr. Lisberg hypothesized that urinating gives dogs an opportunity to communicate with other dogs without continuing to be sniffed directly, thus breaking the tension that is so common when dogs who don’t know each other are greeting one another. When house trained dogs are forced to greet one another inside, they’re robbed of this valuable “pee-and-flee” strategy.\nOne of the best ways to ensure a proper dog greeting is to keep it short and sweet. Since dogs naturally engage in short greetings anyways, it makes sense to play by these canine rules.\nA PSA to pay better attention to our best friends’ body language.\nWhat about dogs who already know each other?\nDogs who are old buddies may go right into play. This works if they are both comfortable with skipping the usual niceties. The problem is that dogs accustomed to this sort of interaction sometimes try the same thing with unfamiliar dogs, who may not respond well. The way dogs act with their best buddies may not be appropriate when meeting someone new. (The same goes for us humans, too!).\nIt’s incredible that simple hellos between dogs can be so complicated. But, given the huge amount of information exchanged during greetings and the potential for intense emotions, we should be more amazed than surprised.",

    "page_content": "Helen’s dog, Benny, was super well behaved, an all-around ambassador to his species, and as every high-achieving student can identify with, “a pleasure to have in class.” Benny was the exemplary kind of dog who chose to rest his head gently on the one child with developmental disabilities when he visited classrooms, could be trusted to keep his paws and mouth to himself at a party where the potluck items wereon the floor or low tables, never barked, and slept throughthunderstorms. He was, in short, quite unusual.\nAs the instructor of his intermediate training class and of his tricks and games class, I could see that he was as easy a dog to train as any I have ever met, and he probably would have been a delightful companion, largely devoid of bad habits, without any training. He was one of those rare dogs who can make any trainer look good. Helen didn’t understand that Benny was a bit of an outlier until after he died, and she adopted her next dog, Miro.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nMiro was, by no means, difficult as dogs go, but he was quite typical and different from Benny. He was a little tricky topotty trainbut not overly challenging. Hechewed,barked,jumped on people, was mouthy,counter-surfed, searched purses for snacks, andpulled on a leashenough to make walking him unpleasant. As much as Helen might have wanted to look inward and say: “OK, so,whatam I doing wrong?,” the truth, in this case, wasnothing. They can definitely respond to training, but all dogs are innately individual.\nDogs Are Who They Are\nI wish everyone understood the individuality of dogs and what that means when it comes to their behavior. Helen learned that lesson, but not every dog parent even knows they need to. Even unlimited love and training won’t turn a dog with impulse-control challenges, high-arousal issues, orfearfulnessinto a dog who is a good match to be aservice dog.\nToo many people are being told that if they would just train their dog better or reinforce them more, they could turn their dog into whatever sort of dog they desire, but I don’t believe that. This line of reasoning does a lot of harm to people; it makes them feel like failures, which is unfair. A dog parent might have trained their pup beautifully, but each dog responds differently to the same amount of and approach to training.\nRenowned animal behaviorist Patricia McConnell, PhD, on what it takes to be a great therapy dog.\nThankfully, many trainers understand the importance of each dog’s individuality. For every dog who professional trainers can trust off leash in any setting, there is a dog who can only be given such freedom in limited situations. Not all dogs are capable of being demo dogs for training classes. But, when many trainers are referencing the dogs who taught them the most, they usually bring up their most challenging dog, not the straight-A student.\nPatience — and Understanding — Is Key\nYears ago, I had a dog who didn’t learn very fast. It would frequently take me weeks, or even months, to teach him something that I would teach my clients’ dogs in one or two sessions. I knew that his speed of acquiring new skills was not an indictment of my training skills; I could clearly train some dogs with much less effort. It was just a fact that my dog was not a quick study, but someone who didn’t know that might have criticized me if they’d seen our slow progress.\nYour pup is special simply because they’re your baby. Remember, their personality, and their response to training, is just as unique. Not every dog is capable of handlinglarge parties, off leash walks in the woods, or childrentrying to hug them, even with lots of training. Some struggle to control their mouths, to keep their barking in check, or to keep all four paws on the floor when greeting anyone. Yes,of coursetraining can lead to improvement in all these behaviors, but some dogs take to the training like naturals and others don’t.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nAccept Your Pup For Who They Are\nSure, it’s a good goal to try to expand the variety of situations theycanhandle with training and behavioral modification, but you wouldn’t want to change who they are at their core — and it doesn’t make sense to try. The variation among dogs (whether the main cause is genetic, a result of earlier life experiences, or the usual mix of these two factors) can’t be undone by training. Forcing your pup to exist in an environment that makes them uncomfortable, or that they can’t handle, won’t do either of you any good.\nNo matter if you have a dog like Benny, one like Miro, or a dog with truly serious behavioral issues, it’s important to accept them for who they are, just as we would want anyone to do for us. So, here’s your charge: Recognize that who your pup is has a lot to do with who they are when they came into your life. And, whoever that is is absolutely perfect in every way — before and after training.",

    },
    "page_content": "Many dog professionals believe thatcratesare a necessity when sharing your life with a dog — and they usually have a point. Crates can be a great management tool: They are helpful with a new puppy’shouse-trainingroutine, they can be a wonderful place for your dog to safely retreat and relax when there are too many visitors in the home, they can be used tosafely transport dogs in a vehicle, and they can be a comfy place for your dog to take an afternoon nap.\nHaving said all that, you may be surprised to hear that crates aren’t always the solution. Many dogs deal withseparation anxiety, and crates can sometimes make these problems worse.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nWhat causes confinement anxiety in dogs?\nWhen dogs suffer from confinement anxiety, their brains process things a bit differently, and confining them to a small space can often heighten their anxiety and stress levels. Think of it like being trapped in an elevator full of people or in a traffic jam in an underground tunnel. Even those of us without anxiety issues may become a bit nervous or uncomfortable. Now, add in ananxiety disorder, and you have a full-blown panic attack.\nSpend less time searching for your dog’s house than you do on Zillow.\nThere could be several reasons a dog panics in a crate, and it’s not always because of separation anxiety. If you have rescued a dog from a shelter, they probably spent many hours confined to a small wire kennel. It’s very possible that they have a negative association with this type of enclosure and won’t find an even smaller crate to be a comfortable place. This can sometimes be easily overcome by usingpositive-reinforcement trainingandfun gamesto help your new dog build a positive association with their crate. (Crate Gamesby Susan Garrett is one example.)\nWhen working with dogs who suffer from anxiety when left home alone, confining them to a crate or other small area is often recommended by well-meaning professionals. They might suggest using an exercise pen (also known as an “X-pen”), a baby gate, or closing the dog in one small room. The reasoning behind these suggestions is usually to preventaccidentson the rug and/or destruction to the home while the dog parents are gone.\nWhat are the signs of confinement anxiety in dogs?\nThe irony is that many dogs with separation anxiety manage to cause even greater destruction or self-injury while in their confinement area or crate. This can  take the shape of torn-up bedding, bent crate wires, or self-injury. Not to mention, their anxiety typically worsens when there is a combination of “home alone” and “confined to a small area.”\nHow can I help my dog with confinement anxiety?\nMany dogs with separation anxiety also suffer from confinement anxiety. Considering that, they actually begin to relax and show more progress when allowed to be free in every area— or a large portion — of the home. Once we eliminate the confinement, they no longer have that feeling of being trapped or as if the walls are closing in on them.\nThis allows us to introduce our behavior modification program with one less hurdle in front of us. Pet parents are often relieved once they see their dogs begin to relax and lie down on their comfydog bed.\nTrain your dog to stay calm when they’re on their own — instead of sad-singing“All By Myself”until you come home.\nIt is very tricky to give an exact amount of time that it would take a dog to get over confinement anxiety. This is something specific and different for each dog and will be determined by how severe the anxiety is. When dealing with confinement anxiety, this is something that needs to be taken at the pace of the dog.\nThis is not something that can be rushed because you need to “crate your dog.” This type of training takes time and a lot of patience. Depending on how severe your dog’s confinement anxiety is, it may be best to get a training plan from a trainer who is knowledgeable in that area.\nMany dogs with separation anxiety have crate or confinement anxiety, but not every dog with confinement anxiety has separation anxiety. Separation anxiety in a dog is typically when a dog becomes extremely dependent on having certain family members around.\nWhen these dogs are left alone, they start to display very undesirable behaviors, such as excessive barking, howling, or whining,chewingand destructive behaviors, having accidents, heavy panting, or drooling. If you think your dog has separation anxiety, it is best to check with your veterinarian to begin to formulate a plan on how to help and possibly treat your dog.\nDiggs has the answer.\nHow to select a crate for a dog with confinement anxiety\nThere are specific crates that are more beneficial to purchase when your dog has confinement anxiety. They may be likely to chew and break through a crate that is not strong enough. Dogs with confinement anxiety have been known to get injured because of the type of crate they were placed in. Broken teeth — or worse — a jaw stuck in the wires of a metal crate, and cracked nails are some of the issues that arise.\nIt is best to stay away from mesh-fabric crates when you have a dog with confinement issues because they would easily be able to escape. Picking a crate for your dog with confinement issues will depend on the severity of their behavior. At times, a wire-metal crate may be OK, but a dog can get their teeth, claws, jaw, or legs caught in this type of crate if the behaviors they exhibit are more than just drooling and barking. Ask a vet or talk with a trainer to decide which crate is best for you and your dog.\nA good alternative to using a crate for a dog with confinement issues would be a safe dogdaycareordog sitter— someone to stay with your dog while you are away to help alleviate the issues.  Another alternative would be to leave your dog in a safe room in your home. This option can be a gamble, though, depending on your dog and the severity of their behaviors. They could try to break out of the room by chewing your siding orscratching up your door.\nA high-anxiety dog crate is one that is escape-proof and typically safe to leave your dog in. High-anxiety dog crates allow you to contain your dog knowing they will most likely not get hurt while you are gone. These crates typically have extra security to keep your dog contained so they do not learn the behavior of escaping a crate.\nThis type of crate will have features to keep your dog safe — one main feature should give you the ability to know there is nowhere on the crate your dog’s teeth, jaw, nails, or legs can get caught. A true high-anxiety dog crate will cost you a pretty penny but is worth all the peace of mind knowing your dog is safe while you are away.\nYes, a true high-anxiety dog crate works to keep your dog safe while they are learning to work through their confinement issues. These crates do not get rid of your dog’s behaviors— that is something you will still need to work on — but they do keep your dog safe. Because a high-anxiety dog crate is escape-proof, it may help teach your dog that escaping is impossible.\nA cratecanbe a wonderful thing for a dog. In fact, some dogs will seek out their crate and willingly go in it several times a day. It’s just important for all of us, including trainers and veterinarians, to consider that this is not a “one-size-fits-all” solution.\nCelebrity dog trainer Victoria Stilwell explains how to crate-train a dog with an intense fear of being in the car.\nWe must be willing to consider what’s best for each individual dog and honor those needs. This should include performing a proper and safe assessment to determine if a dog is comfortable in a crate, especially when left home alone. Some dogs need us to think outside the box before placing them in one.",

      "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/puppy-classes"
    },
    "page_content": "Adopting a puppy is often the first taste many people get of what it feels like to become a legit parent. You may experience a sharp, sudden urge to set your pup up for a lifetime of excellence — spending untold hours scouring pages of chew toy anddog walkerreviews, and (heaven help us all) puppy Reddit. But there’s one thing you can do for your puppy that will truly influence the kind of dog they become: puppy classes.\nWhat are puppy classes?\nYou might be under the impression that a puppy class is about teaching your pup basic commands, but its goal is actually simpler — and arguably more important. It might be more apt to call these courses dogsocializationclasses. “A puppy class is mainly for socialization,” says Lauren Novack, a dog behaviorist. Not to stress you out, but “dogs have a very short socialization period and what happens during this time will set the tone for how they see and interact with the world around them. That window usually closes for puppies at around 12 to 14 weeks of age.” It starts much earlier than that.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHow important is puppy socialization?\n“All of the experiences puppies have within their first 14 weeks of life make a permanent imprint on their brain about what’s safe and unsafe in the world,” Novack explains. “It’s critical that during this period the new experiences your puppy has are positive — you don’t just want them to tough it out on a noisy city street; you want them to be curious about all the elements of it and confident about making good decisions.”\nSocialization is what a good puppy class can help with, and it’s why the importance of puppy class really can’t be overstated. It sets up a careful rubric of experiences for your pet and teaches you how to read their body language so that you don’t overwhelm them. There may also be a brief — emphasis on brief! — time for puppies to play together under supervision.\nEverything you need to know to get your new addition off to a good start.\nWhat you should I look for in a puppy class?\nThis part is really important. “It would be betternotto go to puppy class than to go to a bad one,” Novack says. “In that critical developmental period, it’s just as important to avoid bad experiences as it is to provide positive experiences. If you buy a puppy rather than adopting one, look for a reputable breeder who actively socializes their puppies until they pass them off to you. If you adopt a puppy from a shelter rather than a foster home, get them into a puppy class right away.” Trainers should be certified and have experience in puppy socialization, Novack adds. One major red flag is if the trainers use any kind of punishment or aversion techniques. “That’s something you should run far, far away from.”\nWhen is the best time to start puppy classes?\nDog socialization training should be started within the 12 week time period that’s so important for socialization. The American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior recommends that puppies start classes around seven to eight weeks old after their firstdistemper/parvo vaccine.\nSchedules for puppy classes can vary. Some are once a week, while others are multiple times a week. Puppy class usually lasts around six to ten weeks, but lengths vary depending on the program.\nIf it’s time for a round of shots (no, not that kind), follow this guide.\nWhat will my puppy learn in a puppy class?\nFor very young puppies, group puppy training is mostly focused on socialization rather than trick-training or obedience training. Your puppy will learn valuable social skills, includingbite inhibition, that will set them up for many happy and safe days at the dog park. Your pup may also have a chance to improve on everyday puppy skills likewalking on a leashandpotty training.\nAnd don’t be surprised to not see any puppies at your first class — a humans-only introduction gives the trainer a chance to trainyouon things like when to reinforce your puppy’s behavior and how to understand their body language. Again, don’t expect to learn many obedience tricks in class. “Your pet can always learn skills,” Novack says. “But the opportunity for puppies to learn how to socialize without fear is brief — and it’s not a time you can get back.”\nHow to socialize a puppy\nIt’s helpful to get the guidance of a certified trainer if this is your first time attempting to socialize a dog, or even if it’s just your first time socializing a puppy with a unique temperament — like ifthey’re shyeror mouthier than your previous pets. But if an in-person puppy class isn’t in the cards, Novack recommends finding an online training course to give you a solid foundation.\nA few guiding principles can help you at home. First, think about all of the things your dog will encounter over their lifetime. Hair dryers! Nail clippings! Screeching tires! Little kids! Tall people! And so many other dogs! You want to expose your puppy to as many things that will be part of their regular lives as possible. But not all at once. Aim for “small introductions, one at a time, making sure that your puppy feels calm and safe and happy,” Novack says. One other thing: don’t forget about your puppy’s feet. Give them the opportunity to walk on as many different surfaces as possible — tarmac, astroturf, grass, sand, sidewalk grates, and so on.\nHow to teach your pup to play nice.\nDon’t force puppy socialization\nNot all puppies are going to approach every exposure with enthusiasm. That’s okay — and it’s important that you don’t force your dog into an experience they’re not ready for. “What you want to make sure of is that they’re willing to go outside, their body language is loose, and they’re doing it on their own,” Novack says. “If your dog is hesitant, break the task into smaller pieces.” For instance, if your puppy is nervous about going outside, see if they’re curious about just leaving your apartment’s front door. Once, they’re comfortable with that, see if exploring the hallways interests them. If their body language is relaxed there, see if they’re curious about going in and out of the elevator. Baby steps.\n“Letting your puppy participate in the decision-making is key,” Novack explains. So is understanding that socialization continues even after your formal sessions are over. The skills you learn in puppy class should be applied to every interaction your pup has with new stimuli. “Socialization is happening 24/7.”\nFAQs (People Also Ask)\nDon’t worry about your puppy being a little unprepared for puppy play class — by definition, all the class members will be newbies who are still learning! If your pup misbehaves, the class leader will be ready to settle and redirect your dog. Be sure to find a trainer who usespositive reinforcement training, since a dog should never be punished.\nThere’s a lot more to it than sniffing each other’s butts.\nAsk some trusted sources where you can find a puppy class; you might start with your veterinarian, dog walker, groomer, shelter, or pet-parenting friends. Check outthese pro-tipsfor finding a qualified trainer.\nWhether or not kids are allowed at puppy groups depends on the program. Some will encourage all family members to participate, while others will ask that kids under a certain age stay home.\nReferences\nPuppy Training Guide\nPuppy Training Guide\nPuppy — Training Basics\nPuppy — Training Basics\nPuppy Socialization, Training and Enrichment\nPuppy Socialization, Training and Enrichment",

    "page_content": "Dogs may not always seem to hear what we are saying, but they are mostdefinitelylistening. A a September 2022 study called“Language Preference in the Domestic Dog”in the journalAnimal Cognitioninvestigated dogs’ ability to distinguish between different languages, and it turns out, they can.\nThe study\nThe researchers asked a simple question: “Can dogs tell the difference between English and Spanish?” Scientists already knew that human infants distinguish different languages based on rhythmic cues, and the same ability has also been found in cotton-top tamarins (a species of monkey weighing half a kilogram that lives in Colombia) as well as in rats. Those species do not have long-term language exposure like dogs do, making studies of dogs’ responses to different languages relatable to studies of babies. Dogs, like babies, are always hearing people talk, making dogs an ideal species for studying the role of exposure to language in both language discrimination and language preference.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nTikTok pet parents have made this clear: Tone matters. Celebrity dog trainer Nicole Ellis says dogs can hear “stress in our voice — whether directed at them or when they hear us talking to others.”\nThe dogs in the study all lived in households in which either English or Spanish was the primary language spoken. So, each dog was used to one language, and the other language was new to them. From a linguistic perspective, the many differences between English and Spanish include differences in the length of time it takes to say each syllable. In Spanish, most syllables are of similar length but in English, unstressed syllables are shortened, while ending vowels are lengthened. These variations on syllable length lead to different rhythms in spoken language. For anyone seeking more terminology in their daily life, Spanish is a “syllable-timed” language and English is a “stress-timed” language.\nAll dogs, no matter which language they were used to hearing at home, were tested to assess their responses to both English and Spanish for comparison purposes. Each dog heard 22 seconds of fairy tales in each language. The fairy tales were read by a woman who is a native speaker of both English and Spanish and who was unfamiliar to the dogs. The dogs were in a sound booth while the stories were read to them, and the researchers recorded how long they oriented toward the speaker where the sound of the story was coming from.\nSay What? A look at the types of words that dogs understand.\nTurns out, dogs are good with change\nDogs in both English-speaking homes and in Spanish-speaking homes were able to tell apart the two languages. Spanish-hearing dogs listened longer to English and English-hearing dogs listened longer to Spanish, a result that shows a novelty effect of the dogs’ language preference. In other words, they were more attentive to an unfamiliar language than the one they are used to hearing. An interest in and acceptance of novelty is part of what allows dogs to be our companions and family members. Many species are afraid of anything new, which makes them unable to cope in human society, but the domestic dog is exceptionally good at accepting new things, whether that is sounds, sights, people, or routines, when compared to other species.\nInterestingly, though babies prefer their native language to an unknown language, babies have preferences for novelty over the familiar for non-linguistic stimuli. Maybe puppies would also prefer the familiar over the unfamiliar language, and that would be interesting to study in the future. (The dogs in this study were all adults with an average age of nearly five years old.) Evidence of this idea is that dogs prefer thesound of their own nameover the sound of another name or over the sound of their own name mispronounced. Maybe both babies and dogs prefer familiar language when it is meaningful to them as language but unfamiliar stimuli in other cases.\nYour dog might not know your name. Don’t take offense; just play this game.\nSo, how did dogs pick up English vs. Spanish?\nResearchers do not yet know whether dogs used rhythmic cues or phonological cues to tell the languages apart. They could have recognized familiar words in the stories in the language they were most familiar with, although researchers took care to avoid stories with words dogs were most likely to know such as “walk” or “treat.”\nThere is still so much to learn about the responses and reactions of dogs to different languages. For now, we know that we can say either “I love you” or “Te amo” to dogs, and they will know the difference, even if we are expressing exactly the same feeling.",

    },
    "page_content": "Dogs are scavengers — there’s no pretending otherwise. And some dogs embrace their scavenger nature more than others. If your dog seeks out food (and even things that are most definitely not food) on walks and snarfs it down, you know how scary that can be.\nIf the item they swallow is toxic or causes an intestinal blockage, that can mean an expensive vet visit. But more importantly, snarfing down unknown items is dangerous, which is why it is essential to have some answers to the question, “How do I get my dog to stop eating everything?”\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nYou can’t stop people from littering and you can’t control nature, so fast-food wrappers, chicken bones, toxic nuts, dead birds, rotting sticks, and barely-buried cat poo will always be around. What youcando is protect your dog from the dangers of gulping down the stuff they find.\nIf your dog is prone to scavenging, protecting them from trouble is a difficult but worthy challenge. Here are some ways to do it.\nHow To Stop A Dog From Eating Everything\n“Leave it” tells your dog that they’re not allowed to take a particular item — but you must “proof the cue” (aka, get your dog to respond to a cue in all situations) until they’ve mastered it. You’re probably thinking, “I’ve already tried to teach my dog to do this. It just doesn’t work a lot of the time, especially when they find something extra-special.” I do know how hard it is to successfully teach a dog they can’t have something that’s right under their nose just because you say so.\nThat’s where “proofing the cue” comes in. Teaching a dog to do something is one part ofdog training, but most of the effort is about getting them to do it regardless of what else is going on — in other words, helping them succeed no matter how distracting the environment and how enticing the treasure.Working with a trainerwill make it far more likely that you can successfully proof your dog’s “leave it” so you can use it when it really matters.\nWhen you’re out onwalks, in the yard, or anywhere your dog may be distracted by things to eat, make it worth their while to check in with you. When your dog looks at you, give them something amazing, such as a chunk of real chicken, a small piece of steak, or a bone to chew. In a world filled with interesting things to smell and eat, you have to offer items good enough to compete.\nIf your dog learns that you have special treats that only appear when you are in the great outdoors, they’ll be more likely to pay attention to you. They will also be more likely to respond when you say their name or ask them to “watch.” When you can reliably ask for and get your dog’s attention, you can do so preventively when you see something that may tempt them, thereby avoiding the problem altogether.\nHow to get your pet to stop chewing on inedibles from clothes to couches.\nTrading high-value items is an important skill for dogs who like to scavenge on walks. It is important to build up value to help your dog understand that giving up an item they found is more valuable to them than keeping it from you or eating it. Start with easy items, like your dog’s toys.\nWhen your dog picks up a toy, you can play tug with them or fetch, when your dog comes towards you use a HIGH value treat (chicken, liver, low sodium hot dogs-the treats must be really good/stinky!) and put it up to their nose as their mouth opens say, “trade/drop it,” and immediately put that treat in their mouth once the toy is out.\nAs your dog gets better at this and has started to understand that “trade” means to drop it, you can begin to do the trade with higher demand items like a chew toy. If your dog shows any signs of resource guarding (growling, air snapping, tensing, turning away, or whale eye) you should enlist the help of a trainer before trying to train this behavior.\nEvery place you walk your dogs may have objects that you don’t want them to inhale, but some spots are worse than others. Choose places that offer the fewest temptations in the way of trash and other dangers. Completely avoid areas that could have toxic items, such as hickory nuts or pecans. If your walks include little-traveled roads, one option is to walk in the roadway to avoid surprises hiding in hedges or on people’s lawns.\nDogs who inhale everything they come across often find searching for food and eating it to be the most exciting part of life. If you provide them with opportunities to indulge their drive to seek and consume, it helps take the edge off their desperate need to do so on walks. It won’t stop this behavior, but finding other outlets for it helps lessen the intensity, making it more likely that you can divert their attention with the techniques discussed above.\nFor example, feed your dog by scattering their kibble over a wide area. If you devote half of the kitchen to your dog’s dinner, they have to search for each piece, and that allows them to use their brain and nose at every meal. It also keeps them from eating their dinner in just a few seconds. You could also try making a snuffle mat, a homemade toy that lets dogs sniff out treats.\nTeach them to use their nose in games. Two of the easiest are “Find It,” where you ask your dog to stay and then hide atreat(or treats) they have to find, and “Which Hand,” which allows them to choose the hand that holds a treat by nudging it gently. If they choose correctly, they receive the treat.\nMany slow feed bowls have protrusions that dogs must work around to access their food. This slows them down and requires them to work harder to eat, which provides them with mental stimulation and the ability to make eating slowly a habit.\nSometimes people stop walking their dogs because of the risk that their dog will snarf up something truly dangerous. While that’s better than a medical emergency, not walking your dog can compromise their quality of life. Another (potentially better) option is to physically prevent your dog from being able to ingest these dangers.\nOne barrier is a muzzle. Many people are reluctant to use one because they worry others will think their dog is aggressive, but I wish all the shame and embarrassment associated with muzzles would disappear from our world. Using a muzzle can improve the quality of your walks, allowing your dog to safely sniff and roll and play and enjoy themself.\nThis unique head gear is designed to help protect dogs’ eyes, ears, and noses from foxtail penetration.\nIt’s important that the muzzle doesn’t interfere with your dog’s ability to pant to cool themself off, so choose a basket muzzle rather than a cloth one. A meshOutFox Field Guard— originally made for a protection against dangerousfoxtailawns — can also keep dogs from ingesting rocks, worms, trash, and all the other temptations out there. It is a mesh covering for a dog’s entire head that does not interfere with panting, sniffing, playing, or drinking.\nDogs who love to snarf up things are certainly in danger of hurting themselves (and your budget). But dogs who inhale the world in a second often have a zest for life, and know how to make the most of it. So, while we may not want to follow their lead on what to consume, many of them set a great example of how to “suck out all the marrow of life,” as Thoreau so famously wrote.",

The rise of virtual training sessions has been a godsend to many new pet parents, but for others in-class dog obedience training is a great place to start. Pick the method that is best for you and your pup. Keep reading for our Puppy Training 101 pro tips. (Heads up: We recommend aclickerfor this class.)\nHow to train a puppy\nThere’s nothing more fun than training a new puppy and watching them experience everything for the first time. Ready to get started? Here are your seven puppy training essentials:\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nIf you give your pup free reign, you will regret it later, trust us. Before you start puppy training,set boundariesearly on to avoid breaking bad habits later. You can do this bypuppy-proofingyour home: Keep countertops clear, cover trash cans, hide cords and cables, lock cabinets, and hide away shoes and other valuables away from puppy teeth. Baby gates can also help create a puppy-proofed labyrinth. Once they earn your trust, you can start taking down barriers.\nHere are some simple steps to pry your pup away from thatonespot in the yard they’re obsessed with.\nWith bad choices off the table, it’s time to teach puppy training obedience.That starts with positive reinforcement. Condition your pup to understand what behaviors youwantthem to repeat by rewarding them for their behaviors. Use a marker, like the word “yes” or the click of a clicker, to pinpoint the exact moment they do something you want to encourage. Then, taking a page from Pavlov, follow your marker with positive reinforcement (treats are your most valuable currency). Click, treat, repeat. In no time, your dog will practically be salivating the second they hear your mark. Pro tip: This method also works when training your puppy not to bite.\nIf you’ve ever zoned out during a Zoom call, then suddenly been called to answer a question, you know that winging it when caught off guard doesn’t always work. Likewise, when your dog is distracted, they aren’t going to perform well. Teaching them to focus on you and give you their fullattentionis an essential puppy training command.\nFind a quiet area in your home, stand just as quietly (with treats ready and hidden), and simply wait for your dog to look at you. The second they do, give them a mark-and-treat one-two punch. When your puppy has figured out the power of a glance, you’ll be in for plenty of hungry stares. Once your dog masters this staring contest, try out this trick in places with more stimulation, like in your backyard. And so on and so forth.\nDon’t let your new dogwalk you.\nYour mouth waters watching restaurant commercials, so imagine how ravenous your dog feels when every walk is an olfactory buffet for their keen doggo nose. Walking at a heel calls for an incredible amount of self-control for a dog but is a must for your sanityandtheir safety.\nKeeping outside distractions in mind, startleash training your puppyat home. It’s not required, but you could get a puppy - leash — such as a well-fitted harness with a back attachment point that isn’t too restrictive.  Leash them up, and tell them to sit parallel to you. Say “let’s go,” mark, and treat. Timing is everything! Every step that follows, so long as they stay by your side, should be rewarded. If — rather,when, because it will happen — your pups pulls, don’t chastise them; just stop, turn around, and wait for your dog to get the hint and check in with you. Again, once they get the hang of it, you can take it outside and practice IRL.\nNot to be dramatic but recall training can save your dog’s life. If you have a fenced-in yard, great. If not, use a 20-foottraining leadin a distraction-free zone. Pick a cue, either “come” or “here,” and start by saying it when your puppy is only a few feet away. When they come to you — you know the deal — mark and treat.\nGradually increase the distance by stepping back further and further, cueing your pup to follow. Having a dog who’son-callmeans that you can trust them to swiftly return to you in case of emergency. For example, this could be when they get spooked and slip their collar on a busy street, or a fight breaks out in thedog parkand you want them out of harm’s way.\nKinshipCollective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a stubborn pup to listen up.\nNailing the “stay” command ensures your dog’s (and your mail carrier’s) safety. Like a good true-crime series, it’s all about build-up, which just means telling your dog to stay, counting a few seconds in your head, then marking and treating before releasing them from the command with an “OK!” Put this routine on repeat, increasing the time before treating until you hit 30 seconds, then add some distance to the equation.\nOnce they’ve mastered the basic command, level up by walking in a circle around your dog, leaving the room or, the ultimate test, break out the vacuum cleaner. Don’t get frustrated if your pup snaps out of “stay” — this kind of mind control isn’t going to happen overnight. Trusting them to remain motionless until you give them the green light is a process, but one that’s worth it in the long run.\nThe power of positivity isn’t just a self-help mantra, it’s also key for making your dog comfortable with you (and vets and groomers) handling sensitive body parts like paws and ears. Show your dog that they’re in good hands by pairing touch with treats. Gently hold your pup’s paw and give them a treat. You can eventually work up to anail trimmer— just not on day one. Baby steps.\nHow long does it take to see results?\nEverything is a learning experience for dogs, but it’s a good idea to spend a few days a week dedicated to formal dog training. The ideal puppy training plan will depend on you and your dog. Some trainers find that shorter sessions are more effective than longer sessions. In a study on dog training frequency,researchers foundthat dogs trained one to two times a week learned a new behavior faster than dogs trained daily. Consistency andplay trainingalso play big roles in how quickly dogs learn new behaviors.\nCue theSchoolhouse Rock!because learning can be fun.\nIs it safe to train my puppy without professional help?\nAs long as you do your research, it’s safe to train your puppy without professional help. The caveat: You may not get the best results. Like anything in life, when you’re not an expert at something, it’s hard to do a good job. So it’s often a good idea to call a professional to help you out. Training a puppy is hard work, and getting help from a pro can save you a lot of time and frustration. It can also help prevent problem behavior from developing, such as marking in the house or chewing on clothes or body parts.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nThe first thing you should teach your puppy is their name and recall (aka, to come when called). Both are skills that could save their life.\nTraining a puppy is hard work no matter what age they are. That said, when your puppy is around three to four months, you might find it more difficult to train them because they may display nipping behaviors.\nAs long as your puppy doesn’t have any health issues, you can start training them (including taking them to socialization classes) as early as seven to eight weeks old.\nReferences\nPuppy Training Guide\nPuppy Training Guide\nGuide to Your New Puppy\nGuide to Your New Puppy\nPuppy Care and Training 101\nPuppy Care and Training 101\nThe Pet Barn Puppy Guide\nThe Pet Barn Puppy Guide\nWhen Should You Start Training Your Puppy?\nWhen Should You Start Training Your Puppy?",

    "page_content": "As we close in on fall, the official start of awards season, aka Moira Rose’s “favorite season,” is only a couple of short months away. And if you’re looking for “Biggest Loser of the Year” candidates, I found the perfect nominee: Augusto Deoliveira, aka “The Dog Daddy.” No, he doesn’t qualify for his ridiculous moniker or his affinity for tracksuits. Instead, it’s about the awful ways he treats dogs and the frankly abusive “training” methods he promotes.\nThe truth about “The Dog Daddy”\nThe TikToker masquerading as a dog trainer has amassed a hefty following of millions across his various social media accounts, where he regularly posts clips showcasing his work with behaviorally challenged animals. During these sessions, he can often be seen overtly using force and inflicting pain on his subjects as a means of petrifying them into short-term obedience.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nCelebrity trainer Zak Georgerecently notedon Instagram that Deoliveira primarily utilizes a severely outdated method known as “yank and crank,” which involves no effort to connect or understand the animals while giving little consideration to their emotional wellbeing at any step during the training process. It merely focuses on controlling dogs through violent tugs to essentially choke them into submission.\nThe idea of being a dog’s “alpha” is a popular one — but it’s not an effective way to train.\nGeorge has led a cohort of trainers, organizations, and veterinary professionals who have spoken out against The Dog Daddy’s practices amongst his increasing popularity.\n“This is not even an issue of positive reinforcement trainers disagreeing with trainers who use punishment…Hanging a dog by his neck is not training, it is simply blatant abuse,”Ken Ramirez, the chief training officer at Karen Pyror Clicker Training, tells Kinship. Karen Pryor Clicker Training is dedicated towardpositive reinforcementtechniques, and Ramirez says that he isn’t surprised by Deoliveira’s actions. “There have always been people who use force and exert physical control over animals to get what they want but it doesn’t make it right,” he adds.\nThis is just abuse.\nDespite this, Deoliveira has gained a massive number of followers. It’s something Ramirez credits to a facade of miracle success, noting that these types of extreme tactics can occasionally give the illusion of quick and dramatic behavioral shifts in dogs. But, in reality, the poor pups are just terrified of being hurt again — something that’s not only immoral but ineffective long-term. Ramirez shares horror stories that he’s heard from vets over the years about the true impact of leash yanking to temper a dog’s reactivity. He notes that some have experienced serious injuries to the level of broken necks.\nOffering fewer treats can actually be agoodthing.\nPer Ramirez: “Successful training is about developing trust and building a great relationship with your dog. Fear and intimidation do not assist in building either of those things.” The legitimate trainer explains that when a dog acts aggressive or reactive, it’s usually out of fear. So, when a person uses aversive tools to temper this response, it only confirms the pup’s distress.\nWhy positive reinforcement training is always the way to go\nAlternatively, positive reinforcement helps combat the dog’s fear rather than add to it. These strategies focus on rewarding good behavior instead of punishing the actions of a scared and confused animal. As Ramirez puts it, “Positive reinforcement is effective because it shows the dog what behavior you want, and it gives them an alternative to the unwanted behavior. Punishment focuses on getting rid of behavior while reinforcement helps guide the dog to more desirable behavior.”\nBeyond spewing BS training information across the Internet, The Dog Daddy gets paid quite a lot for his expertise, or the lack thereof. According to his site, Deoliveira charges $400 per group training class and a whopping $1,500 for private lessons. Typically based out of LA, he also takes his “How To Hurt Your Dog” seminars on tour, traveling the globe and offering his sessions during brief city stops. But as awareness of his methods grows, pet parenting communities are fighting back.\nTraining a dog can seem pretty intuitive — until it’s not.\nFollow the protests against The Dog Daddy\nProtests have begun developing locally in the lead-up to many of these classes. In fact, protesters now oftenoutnumber his own clientele. One concerned southwestern trainer recently went as far as starting apetitiononline to halt The Dog Daddy’s ability to practice in the state of Arizona.\n“It is disheartening that someone who claims to be a professional dog trainer would resort to such cruel tactics instead of utilizing modern methods proven by experts worldwide. We cannot allow Augusto DeOliveira’s abusive practices to continue unchecked in our state,” the petition reads.\nPrior to a few planned appearances by DeOliveira in London, theRoyal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) publicly warned against his methods and discouraged pet parents from attending any classes. “We, like many organizations, have significant concerns about the use of aversive training techniques and equipment, e.g. prong collars, which are designed to cause pain and fear. These can compromise welfare and are completely unnecessary,” Esme Wheeler, a dog welfare expert for the org, saidin a statement. These appearances have since been postponed.\nWhat else you should know about The Dog Daddy\nUnshockingly, Deoliveira is also a dog breeder. Last year,The New York Postreportedthat one Staten Island man paid DeOliveira a $1,000 deposit on a German Shepherd that he never received. After multiple planned meetups that ended in no-shows from Deoliveira, a refund was offered. Unsurprisingly, that too seemingly got lost in the mail.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nLast week, Deoliveira responded to growing concerns regarding his violent training methods. “I want to emphasize an important fact: There has been no legal or ethical wrongdoing found in my specialized training methods, nor have there been any legal actions or investigations initiated against me by relevant authorities,” he wroteon Instagram.\nThe statement represented a slight shift from the stance Deoliveira took when initially facing scrutiny for his practices. Following early backlash from a post on June 29 depicting his standard choking-based style of dog training, he uploaded a nondescriptapology videoto his YouTube account. In it, Deoliveira stated that his behavior was unacceptable and promised to take some time off from posting. Three days later, he uploaded avideo on Instagramwith the caption “New Beginnings” displaying the same old abusive garbage he’s become known for.\nSocial media is not a one-stop-shop training source.\nRamirez recommends pet parents avoid TikTok and Instagram as primary sources for in-depth behavioral advice. “Even great positive reinforcement trainers will share training tips on social media but will follow it up with a reminder that every dog is an individual and that serious behavior problems always require a consultation and a plan that has been individualized for that particular dog,” he adds.\nAt this point it should go without saying, but avoid The Dog Daddy entirely unless you’re helping to protest his videos. That you should definitely do.",

    "page_content": "So, you have a new puppy. A small, soft bundle of joy and delight and sweetness and frustration, with tiny needle teeth sharper than any object known to any human being. No matter what breed or mix your puppy is, grooming is (hopefully) about to become abig partof their life. So, how do you set this little one up for success? How do you teach them that grooming is aregular, pleasant part of life, and not a terrifying ordeal to which they must periodically be subjected?\n“There are times when dogs freak out if they have never been to a groomer,” says Jess Rona ofJess Rona Groomingin Los Angeles. “They pee on the table, they panic, they scream. It’s so stressful for them, and it could have been prevented by an owner taking them to get groomed sooner.” The celebrity dog groomer laid out some crucial tips to help familiarize your puppy with the grooming process.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhy is grooming important for puppies?\nGiving your puppy a haircut doesn’t just look cute — it’s crucial to their health. Not grooming your dog regularly can lead to serious health consequences, notes theASPCA. The reason: Groomers can discover health issues like skin conditions, cysts, andear infections, which may be hiding under your pup’s fur.\nWhen should I start grooming my puppy?\nIf you’re wondering when puppies should get their first haircut, Rona recommends that your puppy get their first grooming before their final set ofvaccinationsare complete, usually around 16 weeks of age. This way, you can make sure your puppy is at the groomers as soon as their shots are done — and you won’t be cutting your puppy’s hair too soon.\nWith the perfect brush comes impeccable vibes. Check out this selection.\nHow often should I groom my puppy?\nWhen it comes to how often your dog should be groomed, Rona recommends bringing them in frequently to ensure they start to feel comfortable with the grooming process — roughly twice a month for the first six months, ideally. “And then, maybe a month after your first appointment, that’s when I would do the first haircut. Just so they can really get used to the blow dryer, get used to a new stranger, and just get used to the process,” she suggests.\nHow can I make grooming a regular part of my puppy’s routine?\nTo get into a good puppy grooming routine, it’s important to find the right groomer. As Rona puts it: “If you want to set your dog up to love grooming, go to a place where you know the person will be kind and gentle.” You can figure this out through referrals, or by going to a groomer that has windows through which you can watch your pup being groomed — though the latter option isn’t guaranteed. Some groomers don’t encourage pet parents to watch through windows, as their dogs might see them and get agitated.\nRona also suggests making sure you’re the very first appointment of the day. Later in the day, she says, “you’ve got all your dogs in there, and there’s bathing and drying happening, it’s loud, there are dogs running around…It’s the hustle and bustle and chaos.” Mornings, she adds, are usually much quieter, which will make for a calmer and more pleasurable experience for your puppy. It’s also OK to ask the groomer to go slow and gentle. This will help your dog get used to grooming and not fear it, which is especially important when it comes tocuttingyour puppy’s nails and grooming your puppy’s face.\nFivesimple steps for trimming your dog’s nails at home.\nA key part of normalizing the grooming experience for puppies comes at the end, when you go to pick them up. In all likelihood, they’ll be super excited to see you. They might bark, run around, or try to jump up on you. The best thing you can do in this case, Rona says, is to ignore them until they calm down.\n“I had to learn that the hard way with my dog, because she would pee when she got excited,” she adds. “Dogs get overwhelmed, and the excitement can turn intoanxiety, and it can sometimes turn into aggression. So, I would say to keep a ‘no big deal’ attitude about the groomer.”\nIf your dog loses their sh*t over anything—from a squirrel to a guest. Here are some tips to curtail that.\nCan I groom my dog at home?\nIf you have a small, short-haired dog like a Chihuahua, or if bimonthly groomings are out of your budget, you can always groom your puppyat home.\nHere are Rona’s dog grooming tips:\nGather your supplies: Rona recommends that, before anything else, you ready all the materials you’ll need, like a warm towel, squeeze-bottles for water and for diluted shampoo, and a sponge. This way, everything is within reach “so you aren’t juggling too much when your dog is all wet and acting like a loon.”\nGather your supplies: Rona recommends that, before anything else, you ready all the materials you’ll need, like a warm towel, squeeze-bottles for water and for diluted shampoo, and a sponge. This way, everything is within reach “so you aren’t juggling too much when your dog is all wet and acting like a loon.”\nBrush if necessary: If your puppy has a long coat, brush them out before the bath, and then after, once they are 100 percent dry. “If your dog is matted, and you bathe them and don’t work out the mats, the water will tighten them and make them worse,” Rona explains.\nBrush if necessary: If your puppy has a long coat, brush them out before the bath, and then after, once they are 100 percent dry. “If your dog is matted, and you bathe them and don’t work out the mats, the water will tighten them and make them worse,” Rona explains.\nBathe your pup:When everything’s ready, wash your puppy in water that is warm, but not too hot.

Follow our timeline below to start “training” your puppy between eight to twelve weeks.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat training methods should I use for my puppy?\nOne of the most popular training methods for puppies is using positive reinforcement: The general thinking is that dogs will repeat good behavior when they are rewarded for it. Bad behavior isn’t rewarded or even acknowledged. When you need to correct your puppy, you remove a reward like a toy or a treat. There is no reprimanding.\nAlong the same lines, using your puppy’s food or treats to train them is one of the best tools. By working with food, you will easily be able to get their attention and create a positive association with you giving them direction.\nA dog behaviorist schools us on why puppy classes are more about socializing than getting straight As.\nPuppy training schedule by age\nBelow is the ideal training schedule for the first six months of your pup’s life.\nEight to 12 weeks\nThis early time is for lots of love, positive experiences, exposure, and learning about their home and family. It’s your puppy’s time to know they are home and safe.\nPuppies under 10 weeks old typically can’t hold their bladder for more than 30 minutes or so; that number will increase a bit each week. This means you either need to plan to take your pup outside consistently or, as a fallback, have a safe area available at all times (puppy pads orgrass pads). Puppies need to go out:\nWhen they wake up\nWhen they wake up\nAfter they eat\nAfter they eat\nAfter they drink\nAfter they drink\nAfter they play\nAfter they play\nAny time they look confused\nAny time they look confused\nEvery 30 minutes\nEvery 30 minutes\nBasically, when in doubt, take them out. Every time your puppy pees or poops outside, give them a high-value treat (something your pup loves)rightafter they finish doing their business, so they know to continue heading out whenever nature calls. Avoid punishing your puppy for accidents. It’s frustrating, but they’re still learning and can’t control themselves. Clean it up, throw it in the wash, and get back to rewarding your puppy for all the right things they’re doing.\nTips you’ll want to pay attention to.\nLearning how to socialize your puppy is arguably the most important piece of any successful puppyhood (with propervaccinationsand go-ahead from your vet, of course). This is the process of teaching your puppy all about the world through positive, gradual experiences.\nThe world can be scary for a puppy, and it’s your job to help them learn it doesn’t have to be. Signing up for a puppy socialization class or working with a trainer when they’re young can help your pup establish a positive comfort level from the start. The first 16 weeks are critical for your puppy’s development, so definitely don’t wait on this one.\nSay your puppy’s name and give them a treat. After enough repetitions — which shouldn’t be a problem since volunteers will be lining up for this tough assignment — your pup will start to respond at the sound of their name and know something good will follow. Andta-da, one of many sweet milestones to be accomplished.\n12 to 16 Weeks\nWhy? That limited window isn’t closed yet, but we’re getting close. Keep focusing on new experiences. Don’t wait (you know you’d rather take your puppy everywhere as your plus-one anyway).\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nPuppies — and dogs in general — are not predisposed to being alone. It takes time and positive experiences to learn that being home alone is safe and, to be honest, kind of great. Start by creating good experiences in safe places, such as a puppy pen, crate, or made-safe-for-your-puppy room. Use lots of treats and toys your pup loves and a favoritebed.\nLeave for only seconds or minutes at a time. Gradually increase timeifyour puppy is comfortable — they may vocalize a little, but excessive whining, crying, andbarkingequals distress. Don’t let them just “cry it out.” If your puppy isn’t progressing being home alone within a week or so, contact apositive reinforcement trainerfor help sooner rather than later.\nPuppiesbite. A lot. It’s normal. Part of your job is to help them learn they can play with other dogs and toys with their mouth, but your skin is sensitive. Over the first several months, we “shape” our dogs to use their mouths softer. They get to bite some, but don’t be afraid to use those toys to redirect them when it gets too rough.\nThis can be a good time to start teaching some very basic cues to help open communication with your puppy. If needed, don’t hesitate to work with a positive reinforcement trainer for help. My top three behaviors to teach puppies:\nTouch/hand target\nTouch/hand target\nOffered attention (looking at you)\nOffered attention (looking at you)\n“Drop it” or “leave it” (start with trading for treats)\n“Drop it” or “leave it” (start with trading for treats)\nThose little razor teeth are no fun.\nYou will be working onwalking on a leashfor months or longer. But this is a good age to introduce a leash, let your puppy drag it around, and start to reward your pup for walking with you.Harnessesare also the best fit for a young puppy learning about leash walking (actually best foralldogs during walks and healthier for their necks). Be generous with treats to teach them what you want and be patient.\n16 to 24 weeks\nDon’t rush to teach too many things too fast. Learn about your puppy and what your and theirspecific needs are. There is so much time to teach new behaviors. Focus on the foundations of just a few basic skills now and ensure your puppy is well socialized, comfortable in the world, sniffing all the sniffs, and having positive experiences on walks. They’ll be taking in new sights, sounds, and experiences with ease. Not to mention, connecting with you. Just like humans, your new puppy will be learning forever. Slow down and enjoy the walk.\nSix months and beyond\nBy six months, your puppy should know their basic commands and have a pretty good handle on potty training,crate training, and socializing with other dogs. It’s important to continue to make progress every month after that. Keep meeting new people and dogs and exposing your puppy to new experiences and sounds. Your puppy should also be able to increase time in between bathroom breaks. You should also continue to:\nConsistency iskeyfor your puppy.

It’s a lot easier to pick up a 15-pound puppy who isn't listening versus a 70-pound grown dog! By training early, you’re setting you and your puppy up for more peaceful cohabitation for the rest of both of your lives.

    "page_content": "Lola is my five-month-old Shepherd / Labrador Retriever mix. We adopted her about a week ago from a foster home. She starts off great when we go on walks, but after about five minutes, she is constantly pulling and zig-zagging. I keep the leash all wrapped up so she has to walk next to me, but she still keeps pulling. Stopping and redirecting her doesn’t seem to work. The minute we start walking again, she starts to pull. I’m not sure what to do next. — Ines\nCongratulations on your adoption! Leash-pulling is a super common problem for dogs, especially puppies like Lola who are just learning how to walk on a leash. The good news is it sounds like Lola’s an eager, curious puppy — and with a little guidance, she can explore her new neighborhood safely and calmly.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nFirst, identify your dog’s motivation and remove distractions.\nThe first thing we need to do is identify what it is that’s motivating the behavior of pulling. It could be that a dog is fearful and overwhelmed by environmental stimuli, and they’re trying to escape. Alternately, it could be that they’re super jazzed tosniff around and explore their environment. In either case, we need to make staying by your side seem like the best option to your dog.\nDog trainer Karen B. London promises you’re not doomed to be pulled down the street forever.\nYou can do this using positive reinforcement, a.k.a. lots oftreats. Don’t be shy about the number of treats you give, because you can always fade food out of the equation over time. You might want to plan your training around Lola’s feeding schedule so that she has an empty stomach during training, and she’s extra motivated by food rewards. Use these high-value rewards in an environment where Lola is not distracted, whether that’s a yard or hallway or courtyard — anywhere your dog can pay full attention to you. Start where the dog can hear you and focus on you. Eventually, you can slowly increase the challenges present, bringing Lola to more and more distracting environments.\nAvoid following their pull, and avoid pulling back.\nAllowing a dog to pull and following them with tension on the leash just reinforces pulling. The dog learns that pressure on the neck means forward movement, which is what’s motivating their behavior. In other words: your dog wants to move forward, and if you move them forward when they pull, they’re gonna want to keep pulling.\nIf your pup acts diabolical on walks, you are not alone. Here’s what you can do.\nAt the same time, yanking your dog or correcting them could add stress, and we don’t want to add stress to training — this could lead to reactivity issues down the line. Dogs have something called an oppositional reflex. What that means is when pressure is applied to them, they have the natural instinct to push or pull back. It’s not because they’re disobedient; it’s how they’re hardwired. Because of their oppositional reflex, yanking a dog or holding a dog’s leash too tightly near you just makes the problem worse. You want to aim for a loose, slack leash.\nLevel up your equipment.\nIf a dog is really strong, as Lola will probably be when she’s grown up, you might need a piece of equipment that gives you more control without adding pain. We want to control using leverage, not suppress using force.\nNo-pull harnessesare a good start. That’s a harness where the leash attaches in front of the dog on the chest area, which is right in front of the dog’s center of gravity. When the dog goes to pull forward, they can’t as easily engage the pressure on the leash and pull you. You can also give them a bit of a pull back and interrupt their forward momentum without hurting their neck and restricting their airways.\nStyle and safety don’t have to be mutually exclusive (phew).\nIf the harness isn’t effective or your dog is improving but occasionally jolts out of line, a head collar is another potential solution. A head collar is a bit more intrusive to a dog than the harness, so it does take some time to desensitize your dog to be comfortable wearing it. It doesn’t operate on pain, but it fits around a dog’s snout, so some dogs have trouble getting used to it. The device operates on leverage; it’s similar to a horse bridle.\nKeep in mind that the training has to happen with or without equipment. The harness or head collar can help you get in front of a dog’s ability to use their body weight to pull you forward, but it won’t solve the problem. Plus, your training regimen with your dog is a bond the two of you form together, and it will be the greatest tool to problem solve in the future.",

      "title": "A Crash Course on Dog Agility Training",
      "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/dog-agility-training"
    },
    "page_content": "Ever watch a Westminster agility champ fly through the obstacles with precision and think:My dog could do that? Or cry laughing when some less-than-graceful dog launches into the course with joyful abandon doing whatever they please? If either scenario resonates, agility training might be the perfect exercise for you and your dog to do together.\nWhat is Agility Training?\nIt’s learning and practicing the physical and mental skills behind a fun, often fast-paced sport that involves both you and your dog working as a seamless duo. If we had you until “seamless,” not to worry, getting there together is half the fun and a great way to deepen the bond with your dog. In agility training, there’s typically an obstacle course that your dog runs through with you as their hype person, and where the fastest time wins — if you’re competing professionally, that is. Agility training isn’t just for Westminster, though. It can be done in the comfort of your home or backyard with easy-to-find obstacles from tunnels to hoops to weave poles. Or, forget the equipment and just teach your dog to weave through your legs. It all counts in our book.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nAgility works for pretty much every dog, no matter the breed, size or age. If your dog is social, physically fit and likes to learn, they will most likely enjoy agility. Older dogs or certain breeds that might normally be characterized as couch potatoes come to life when given extra attention and mental and physical stimulation from agility.\nBenefits of Agility Training\nWhatever your dog’s end goal — championship dreams or soul-satisfying good times — the potential benefits are the same. There are plenty of ways you can use agility training to help your dog thrive,well beyond the course.\nWalking is great, sure, but usually not enough stimulation for our dogs. Agility works both physically and mentally to stimulate and tire our dogs out in the best way. Learning how to get your dog to go over, under, around, or through different obstacles as you call out directions, while running to keep up with them, is the best kind of all-purpose exercise for you both. But you don’t have to be a track star, and your dog doesn’t have to be aBorder Collie. Any breed or mix with an eager-to-please attitude can discover that agility is theirthing. One key requirement is a foundation of good health — younger dogs or breeds prone to joint injuries should take it slow to avoid risk to vulnerable areas and muscles.\nYou can’t have agility without “agile.” It’s all about the base — teaching your dog to be aware of their back end helps keep their body in great working order. They need to know how to keep their back paws close to obstacles to get around them efficiently. A good trainer will show you how to support your dog’s smooth, safe movement for agility now and healthy mobility long-term. It’s a role that should also include keeping your dog in great shape — maintaining ahealthy weight, and taking time to warm up and cool down before and after training. Small disclaimer: No guarantees your dog’s new back-end control will extend towards preventing happy tail swooshes of wine glasses from surrounding coffee tables.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nThe good news is agility training doesn’t require your dog (or you) to have any specific skills before you start. But it is helpful to at least have an understanding of basics like sit, down, watch me, and stay. Here’s your chance to refresh simple skills they already know, letting thetreats flowto celebrate, and bask in your dog’s every success.\nAgility is 100% present time with your dog. No cell phones, no distractions. Totally tuning in to them makes it possible to start thinking and moving as one. Your dog will be in heaven, and you’ll develop an unspoken language between you that, while it may not fulfill the dream of them speaking English, makes all the other parts of your life together more magical. Spending extra time training your dog will teach you a lot about their personality as well as strengthen the bond between you. Find out what motivates them most: toys, praise, food or a combination?\nAgility training might be the perfect way to give fearful dogs their moment. Although it isn’t an absolute cure for fearfulness or other issues likeseparation anxietyandreactivity, it can build confidence, which, in turn, lowers anxieties. Learning life skills in a playful way allows your pup to shed stress. And because agility training requires using their minds, dogs will expend energy quicker and less able to focus on things they perceive as scary. Most of all, teaching them through positive reinforcement tells them we have their backs, always. Pro tip: If your dog isn’t a fan of other dogs, you’ll want to start with private sessions or on familiar turf.\nHow to Get Started\nIf you and your dog are new to agility, it’s helpful to start by finding a local agilitytraining class and trainer. Look for one that is founded in positive-reinforcement, reward-based training. Watch out for euphemisms like “balanced training” that include negative methods and force correction tools. Any hint of negativity, fear, or force creates the opposite of the successful experience you’re going for with your dog. Check certifications and ask questions of your potential trainer. You want to be sure you’re getting someone who knows what they’re talking about, is staying up-to-date on the best science-based training methods, and won’t push your dog past the threshold.\nOnce you start, move at your dog’s pace: If your pup is the nervous type, start with just one obstacle, then try again another day. Use treats and toys freely to reinforce the behaviors you’re asking them to accomplish on the course. Above all, remember that your biggest reason for doing agility is growing your bond with your dog, so have fun and enjoy the windy road together.\nJulia Lane, the owner of Spot On K9 Sports, shares her tips on finding a class that meets your and your dog’s unique needs. Here are three main considerations for choosing the best match:\nThe environment.When you enter the agility training facility—whether it’s a snazzy indoor training school or a fenced-off grassy field—take a look around. Is the equipment in good shape? What kind of flooring is used? Artificial turf or thick rubber matting made especially for performance sports helps ensure that you and your dog won’t get hurt.\nThe instructor.Even if you know nothing about agility, you will have a gut reaction to what you see. If the instructor yells or students look stressed or frustrated, obviously no one is having fun. Look for an instructor who communicates well with the students and gives equal attention to each dog/handler team.\nThe dogs.How many dogs are in the class? Is there a lot of down time? How many often does each dog get a turn? Is safety stressed by the instructor? You don’t want a beginning or “green” dog to jump full height or go over obstacles like the A-frame or dog walk at full height. Also, only one dog should be off leash at a time, even at the most advanced levels.\nWhen it comes to dog agility equipment, there are so many options that work with dogs big and small. Julia shares a quick breakdown on the most popular tools:\nTheA-frameis a tall, wooden or aluminum structure whose apex is typically set at 5' 6\"or can go as high as 6' 3\" at the championship level.\nThedog walkis a raised, narrow plank that the dog must cross as quickly as possible without sacrificing safety or missing the contact zone on the exit ramp.\nThepause table—araised platformupon which the dog must do a sit-stay or a down-stay.\nJumpsare self-explanatory, though there are quite a variety of them. They range from the simple bar jump (imagine a hurdle jump) and the wide boards on the ground that comprise the broad jump to the winged jump, which is a bar jump with plastic lattice “wings” on either end.\nThere are two different kinds oftunnels. The open tunnel is a tube through which the dog runs as fast as possible. The closed tunnel, or chute, looks like a giant wind sock. The dog must run through it in order to push up the material and exit.\nTheweave polesare challenging for dogs to learn because the weaving motion is unnatural to them. Twelve upright poles, each attached to a heavy steel base, are set out in a row.",

    },
    "page_content": "When you first bring home a puppy, your priorities might go like this: get in the maximum number of cuddles, make sure they get those puppy naps in, and keep them from chewing every single item in your home. You might not be thinking about another very important part of puppy development: socialization.\nJust as it’s good for babies to meet other babies — even if all they do is stare at each other — puppies need to see and interact with other dogs. So, in addition to the oodles of cuddles on your prio list, make sure you add a social hour or two to your pup’s weekly schedule.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nWhy is socialization important for my fearful dog?\nI have a six-month-old named Gator who is a super shy puppy; he is a velcro dog and never leaves my side. He’s generally pretty happy, but he lived in the mountains for the first couple of months of his life, so isn’t used to hanging out with other dogs. At dog parks, he doesn’t play with other dogs unless they approach him first. How can you socialize a nervous dog?\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nBeing a bit cautious isn’t necessarily a bad thing, says Kinship Collective member and dog trainerRobert Haussmann. But perhaps we can help improve his comfort level and willingness to engage other dogs. We also want to prevent him from becoming over-stressed and developing any fearful or reactive behaviors around other dogs.\nDogs go through adevelopmental stageknown as thecritical period— commonly referred to as the socialization period — between two and 14 weeks of age. During this time, dogs can develop familiarity with a variety of sights, sounds, other animals, people, and situations. It is their exposure during this crucial time that builds resilience and confidence around novelty. The more exposure, the more comfortable they become. Because Gator has spent much of his early socialization period in the mountains, he may not have developed his social chops with other dogs. This can leave him feeling unsure about inviting or accepting play and/or expressing his likes and dislikes and his ability to safely resolve conflict.\nAt six months of age, Gator is just startinghis teen years. Along with the awkwardness that befalls all teens, dogs also hit yet another developmental phase called the secondary fear period. The secondary fear period starts between six and eight months of age and lasts until about 18 months. This lesser-known and often overlooked stage of life coincides with the time when a dog would leave the care of his mother and venture off in the world. Nature, being as clever as she is, flips a little switch in the brain that says,Be careful, if you’re not 100 percent sure, stay back, and proceed with caution!\nWhat to expect when your perfect puppy hits that unruly stage.\nHaving a sheltered early socialization period followed by intense exposure during the secondary fear period can lead to anything from minor discomfort to severe fearfulness depending on the dog. Lucky for you, it sounds like Gator is more of the former and just feels a bit uncomfortable around other dogs. Here are some tips to help him go from wallflower to social butterfly.\nHow can I tell if my dog is shy or fearful?\nHere are some of the most common signs of an unsocialized dog:\nA fearful dog might have flattened ears, lick their lips, yawn, cower, avoid eye contact or tuck their tail between their legs when around strangers or other dogs\nA fearful dog might have flattened ears, lick their lips, yawn, cower, avoid eye contact or tuck their tail between their legs when around strangers or other dogs\nA shy dog might exhibit aggressive behavior, such as staring, erect ears, barking a lot, snarling, or growling and snapping when around strangers or other dogs\nA shy dog might exhibit aggressive behavior, such as staring, erect ears, barking a lot, snarling, or growling and snapping when around strangers or other dogs\nA shy or fearful dog might back up, raise their hackles, or exhibit aggressive behavior when on walks even if no one else is around.\nIf it’s time for a round of shots (no, not that kind), follow this guide.\nWhat is the best age to start socializing my shy dog?\nDogs go through a developmental stage known as the critical period — commonly referred to as the socialization period — between two and 14 weeks of age. During this time, dogs can develop familiarity with a variety of sights, sounds, other animals, people, and situations. It is their exposure during this crucial time that builds resilience and confidence around novelty. The more exposure, the more comfortable they become.\nHow do I start socializing my shy dog?\nDog parks,daycares, and playdates with other rowdy puppies may be a bit too much for Gator. Closed spaces with larger groups of dogs running around and playing can often be pretty overwhelming. To introduce a nervous dog to other dogs, try enlisting some friends or family members with dogs to go on walks together, moving in the same direction and having the chance to be near each other without a lot of face-to-face encounters right away. Allow both dogs to take their time and feel safe. They are seeing and smelling each other from a distance while roaming around together sniffing and exploring.\nAfter about 10 minutes of this, you can stop and see if they are interested in sniffing each other for a few seconds. Once they have given a sniff or two, walk-on for a bit longer, stopping occasionally to assess their comfort level and allow them to engage in prosocial behavior. They can then be encouraged to have a little outdoor off-leash play too. Building Gator’s social experience and exposure should accumulate into an overall sense of safety in the presence of dogs.\nSound advice from seasoned dog and cat parents who have been there.\nWhat are some socialization techniques for shy dogs?\nSome dogs play rough, some dogs play gently. Some dogs like to chase, some dogs like to wrestle. Others just want to play fetch and be left alone. When you’re trying to teach your dog to greet other dogs calmly, follow Gator’s lead on what kind of player he is and set him up with playmates and activities he enjoys. Perhaps the dog park on a Saturday morning is just too rowdy for him. Maybe the closest dog park is just not big enough for him to find a buffer to create space and assess the situation. Maybe he is more into an open field with a few good friends. If you find a group of dogs he gets on with, try and make it a regular thing. If you find a big open park where he can avoid rowdy dogs and find chiller playmates, go out of your way to take the trip — even if it means passing the park right down the block.\nTo help build confidence in your insecure or shy dog, engage in activities where Gator can feel capable and safe can help him in his day-to-day confidence. Try engaging in somescent games. Have him perform a down stay in one room while you hide his breakfast, a few kibbles here, a few kibbles there, then release him to go find it. If he eats wet or raw food this can be distributed in stuffable rubber toys and hidden in the same manner.\nSpeaking of stuffable toys, invest in a variety ofinteractive feeding toysthat he can engage with and dissect. This can be the primary way he eats his meals and any snacks outside of training. Having him search and forage for his own food is a great way to help him feel capable.\nA dog behaviorist schools us on why puppy classes are more about socializing than getting straight As.\nA well-rungroup training classcan be an organized way to train a timid dog by engaging with other dogs without play being the primary focus. Find a dog socialization training class with a professionally certified trainer who practices LIMA (Least Intrusive, Minimally Aversive) techniques and has plenty of experience. Learning a strong foundation of training cues is also a real confidence booster and opens up a clear line of communication and strong bond between you and Gator.\nWhat if my shy dog shows signs of distress during socialization?\nWhile it will be tempting to take him into thedog parkon a Saturday when everyone looks like they are having a good time, try to avoid putting him in situations where he may feel overwhelmed. You may even receive well-meaning advice to keep bringing him until he gets used to it. But this can have adverse effects on your progress, especially during this sensitive time in his development. Exposure to dogs is critical to getting him to feel more confident around them and therefore more social. Make sure to work slowly until he is ready and excited to go play.\nOnce Gator is more comfortable playing with dogs, it is still important to know when he has had enough or if he is feeling a bit overwhelmed. Familiarize yourself with canine body language and the subtle cues that indicate when he is and is not comfortable. Remember you are his teacher, guardian, and overall main squeeze. He depends on you for information and trusts you to make decisions that keep his best interests in mind.\nThere are no stupid questions — well, when it comes to your dog’s health.\nFAQs (People Also Ask):1) Should I force my shy dog into social situations?\nDefinitely not!

      "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-lifestyle/where-does-your-dog-sleep"
    },
    "page_content": "Like humans, dogs are social animals. Most of them feel comfortable being near the rest of the family and that includes at nighttime. Many people have their dogs in their room on adog bed, in acrate, or on the floor by the bed. Others like to have them to sleep on the foot of the bed.\nStill, others snuggle with their pup right next to them, even under the covers. They keep you cozy while making you feel safe, secure, and loved. It’s a wonderful feeling to have dogs snuggle up at night, or even during a nap. Indeed, 45 percent of people say they allow their dog to sleep in their bed,according to a surveyby the American Kennel Club. Despite how common this is, there are still many people who ask if you should you let your dog sleep with you.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nWith so many dogs sleeping in our beds, isn’t it about time we throw away the guilt so many people feel about having their dogs share the same sleeping space? I talk to pet parents every week who apologetically tell me their dog sleeps with them. They often share this information as though they are making a confession, and many say, “I know I’m not supposed to, but I let my dog sleep with me.” Somehow, the cultural consensus is that sleeping with your dog in bed is a problem.\nIt’s science (and adorable).\nIt’s sad how many people feel bad about letting their dogs up to sleep on the bed at night when that decision is totally theirs to make. Far too many people feel judged about it, but it’s good to see they are making their own choices about letting their dog sleep with them, because that’s what it is — a choice.\nThere are many factors that can help people make a well-informed decision about where to have their dog sleep, but the judgment of other people should not be one of them.\nDog sleep habits\nThe average sleep time for dogs is in the range of 12 to 14 hours a day, a figure that refers to adult dogs. Puppies need even more sleep — 15 to 18 hours is not unusual for them. Because dogs need more sleep all day than people do, it is usually easy to sync our nighttime with theirs. Most dogs will sleep at night when we do and then get their napping in throughout the day as needed.\nMost adult dogs sleep all through the night, though they can be woken up by loud noises, by being touched, or if they are uncomfortable for any reason. Many senior dogs do wake up in the middle of the night, sometimes because they need to pee. Puppies frequently wake up during the night, though many of them will sleep till morning once they are in the range of four to six months old.\nDogs need more sleep than humans. Here’s how much is healthy.\nShould I consider my dog's age when deciding on their sleeping area?\nYour dog’s age can influence where you choose to have them sleep. Dogs at different stages of their life merit different considerations when you decide where they should sleep.\nPuppies can easily get themselves into trouble while we are sleeping and therefore unable to supervise them. That’s why I like to have puppies sleep in a crate. That way, they aren’t going to chew up household items, and if they do have an accident, it’s at least confined to one area. My preference is to have the crate in the bedroom so the puppy has company. They are social and are more likely to feel safe and secure near you. Also, that way, you are more likely to respond if they become upset or wake up and have to go outside to pee. If you are not using a crate, you can consider confining them in the room with you or putting them in a puppy pen in your room.\nSome puppies grow up sleeping in a crate and remain most comfortable and happy in one throughout their life. Others prefer to be on the floor, in a dog bed, or on the bed with you as they age. Once they are old enough that it’s safe for them to sleep without being confined, whether you stop having them sleep in the crate or not depends on what makes you happiest and what makes your dog happiest. Continuing to sleep in a crate during the first year or two is common because many dogs are less likely to chew things they shouldn’t by that time.\nThere are pros and cons of sleeping with your dog — for both of you.\nWhere should adult dogs sleep?\nMost adult dogs are happiest if they sleep in the same room as you. As social animals, it can be stressful for many of them to be separated from everyone else in the household at night. Within your room, they can be in a crate if they like being in one, on a comfortable dog bed on the floor, or up on the bed with you. The primary goals are to keep everyone happy and to allow everyone to have a restful night of sleep. If that means having the dog in the bed with you, your dog will likely be very happy about that. If they prevent you from getting adequate Zs, then having them in a crate or on a dog bed rather than up in your bed are better options for everyone.\nSenior dogsor dogs with health problems should sleep wherever they are most comfortable. If that means up on the bed (and they don’t ruin your nights), that’s great. If that means on the floor by your bedside, that is a wonderful option. It is especially important to provide dogs in any pain with the bedding that eases their discomfort. That may mean a soft, cushioned bed, or it may mean a dog cot that is raised off the floor to allow better air flow. Some dogs with health issues, or those who are old, may need help getting on and off the bed — or even on and off a dog bed. Make sure you help them if they need it, especially as they age.\nIf hypothyroidism is to blame, it’s bestnotto let sleeping dogs lie.\nAdvantages of sleeping with your dog\nThere are many reasons to let your dog sleep with you: Dogs typically like to sleep with us. They are less likely to become stressed, either frombeing aloneor in response to something startling, like lights from cars going by or a thunderstorm. In the morning, you’ll know when they have to go out right away — or if they are sleeping in that day.\nIf your dog is in or on your bed, any cold weather will seem a lot less harsh with a living furnace right next to you. Sharing sleep is one way to feel really close to each other, and that’s always a plus.  Sleeping with your dog:\nReduces depression\nReduces depression\nPromotes theta brainwaves\nPromotes theta brainwaves\nIncreases sense of security\nIncreases sense of security\nEases insomnia\nEases insomnia\nMaximizes comfort\nMaximizes comfort\nDecreases loneliness\nDecreases loneliness\nImproves sleep quality\nImproves sleep quality\nReduces stress\nReduces stress\nLowers blood pressure\nLowers blood pressure\nStrengthens your relationship\nStrengthens your relationship\n“Let sleeping dogs lie” is more than just a confusing old saying.\nDisadvantages of sleeping with your dog\nOn the downside, some people find a dog in their bed keeps them awake, either because the dog snores or because there is not enough room in the bed or enough covers to go around. It can cause considerable friction in a relationship if one member of a couple loves having a dog on the bed and the other person doesn’t.

I will not lapse into poetry here, but I will share some of the advantages of having a dog sleep in a crate.\nCrates keep dogs and houses safe. Dogs can find danger in the form of electrical cords, food that’s not good for them, and things that are not even food but can be swallowed. Having a dog sleep in a crate protects them from these dangers while you are sleeping and unable to supervise your dog. Similarly, dogs who are loose at night may eliminate indoors, chew up a family heirloom, or attempt to remodel your house by treating the door frame as a toy. Crates solve these problems.\n(And your own, while you’re at it.)\nIf your dog is used to sleeping in a crate, it makes traveling easier. Wherever you go, whether you are visiting friends, at a hotel, or staying in a camper, your dog can sleep in the crate. Since this is just what they do at home, they are likely to have an easier time adjusting to life on the road. A dog who can easily travel is a dog who is more likely to get to come along on trips.\nDogs who are used to crates are less stressed when they have to go someplace new and are put in a crate. If your dog is used to sleeping in a crate, it is likely they will have an easier time handling a potentially stressful outing. Stressful outings can include being at the veterinarian or at the groomer. They could also include a situation in which the whole family has to evacuate because of a natural disaster. I hope it never happens to you, but if you do have to evacuate, it will be far easier on your dog if they are used to sleeping in a crate because they may need to be in one at a shelter or other temporary housing.\nDisadvantages of dogs sleeping in crates\nDogs are individuals, and not every one of them likes crates as much as I do. Some dogs dislike being in a crate, and if that’s true of your dog, then they shouldn’t be asked to sleep in one. It’s still a good idea to teach them to be as comfortable as possible in a crate because of the advantages of that, but they do not need to sleep in one regularly.\nThere’s nothing wonderful about having a dog in a crate who is unhappy there. There are dogs who bark or whine when put in a crate, and that’s not good for anybody’s sleep. Other dogs salivate or pant, or show other signs of distress. Yes, crates offer advantages related to safety and convenience, but those pluses can easily be outweighed by the negatives if a dog dislikes being in one.\nBoundaries, folks. Boundaries.\nDogs who are in crates cannot make all the choices they can when they are out of a crate. Their agency is taken away by being confined. A crated dog can’t choose to be in a different area of the room where the temperature is different or there is a breeze (or isn’t a breeze) coming through the window.\nThey can’t walk around if they feel like it. The crate prevents much of their freedom, which is what they are designed to do. For many dogs, that leads to a sense of safety or perhaps they don’t care one way or the other. But dogs who do care about having choices, a crate puts uncomfortable limits on them.\nA major disadvantage of crates is that they take up so much space. I’ve lived in some small houses. None were straight up tiny houses, but they were small enough that I asked my artist mother-in-law to paint a sign that says, “Love grows best in little houses.” Love and little houses are a great combo, but crates and little houses are not. In small houses, or houses with small bedrooms, the space occupied by a crate can be a huge inconvenience, especially if the size of the dog necessitates a large crate.\nWhat are some alternative sleeping arrangements for my dog?\nYour dog might not want to sleep in a bed, but there are other options where your dog can safely get a good night's sleep. Your dog might want to sleep in their crate, at the foot of the bed, or in another cozy spot of their choosing.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nYes, atleastone. I love for dogs to have choices about which bed they like. The location of the bed, as well as the style of bed, may influence your dog’s preference for sleeping (or resting) there. I like to have at least one dog bed on each floor of the house, and I prefer for there to be multiple options in the room where they sleep.\nMany dogs like big, flat dog beds, while others prefer donut beds or other option with something to lean against. Dogs have preferences for the size of their bed, too, and it always amazes me how many big dogs actively choose a small bed to curl up in even when a much larger bed is available. Just as we have many options for where to sit — couch, armchair, straight back chair, or even a bean bag, many dogs delight in various options when it comes to their own furniture. When it’s cold, they may choose a fluffy bed, but gravitate toward a cot dog bed in warmer weather.\nIt’s not generally recommended that dogs sleep outside. That exposes them to temperature extremes and to dangers from wildlife, and makes them vulnerable to someone taking them. Additionally, many dogs act like they are on sentry duty when they are left outside. Being vigilant and on guard isstressfulfor them. It’s far better to avoid these issues and have them inside to sleep.\nOne exception to this is dogs who have lived outside all their lives, perhaps as strays, before being adopted. These dogs sometimes prefer to be outside, perhaps finding the massive change to a life indoors too overwhelming. With these dogs, it is good to teach them to be comfortable indoors for their own safety and to build a closer relationship, but they should not be forced to come inside if they are too scared or otherwise uncomfortable to do so on their own.\nThe best way to make a dog comfortable while sleeping is to give them choices aboutwhereto sleep. If they choose to sleep on the bed with you, or on the floor, or on a dog bed, or in a crate, they are likely comfortable there. Whether your dog sleeps at the foot of the bed, your dog sleeps under the bed, or your dog sleeps under the covers with you, their choice tells you they want to be there.\nOther ways to make your dog comfortable are to provide them sleeping conditions that suit them. That includes soft beds, cushioning, or blankets. It’s also important to keep the room a comfortable temperature. Just like people, dogs sleep better when the temperature is right, though that can vary for individual dogs. The most important action most of us can take to make our dogs comfortable while sleeping is to have them near us, in our room, and perhaps in our bed. That’s great news because so many of us are most comfortable with a sleeping dog in the bed, too.\nReferences:\nDifferences in Pre-Sleep Activity and Sleep Location Are Associated With Variability in Daytime/Nighttime Sleep Electrophysiology in the Domestic Dog\nDifferences in Pre-Sleep Activity and Sleep Location Are Associated With Variability in Daytime/Nighttime Sleep Electrophysiology in the Domestic Dog\nSleep Duration and Behaviours: A Descriptive Analysis of a Cohort of Dogs up to 12 Months of Age\nSleep Duration and Behaviours: A Descriptive Analysis of a Cohort of Dogs up to 12 Months of Age\nThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime: The Effects of Pet-Human Co-Sleeping and Bedsharing on Sleep Dimensions of Children and Adolescents\nThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime: The Effects of Pet-Human Co-Sleeping and Bedsharing on Sleep Dimensions of Children and Adolescents\nIs It Good to Sleep With Your Dog in Bed?\nIs It Good to Sleep With Your Dog in Bed?",

If you’re about to become a dog parent for the first time and are about to start saying that phrase a lot, this article is also for you. The park can be a fun way for your pup to socialize and get some exercise — as long as you follow some basic dog park rules. We asked Robert Haussmann, certified dog trainer and co-founder ofDogboy NYC, for tips on how you and your pup can be the cool kids at the park and notthatdog andthathuman.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat is dog park etiquette, and why is it important?\nDog park etiquette is essential for you and your pup to have a positive experience —Haussmann shared his top tips for ensuring that you’re both following the rules and respecting the other humans and dogs there.\nHow do dog parks work?\nDog parks are generally areas that have been designated for dogs to play off leash. Each dog park has its own rules and regulations that are important to follow. Often, the area is fenced in, so it’s safe to let your dog run free and play. Sometimes, there are dog park activities your pup can partake in. You can evencreate your own dog parkin some cases.\nHow can I tell if my dog is ready for the dog park?\nIf you’re wondering how to introduce your dog to the dog park: The best way to ensure that your dog has a good time is to not to go...until you’re ready. Dog parks can be good for socialization, but there are a few things you should know and do before your pup makes their dog park debut.\nDoes your dog like to chase but not wrestle? Wrestle but not chase? Casually sniff things while never getting too close to another living thing? Understanding your dog’s likes and dislikes will help you determine if the dog park is something they are likely to enjoy, plus make it easier to assess if your dog is having a good time once they’re there.\nThere’s a lot more to it than sniffing each other’s butts.\nDogs tell us a lot through their body language — if we know what to look for. “Sometimes, the signs they give are obvious (growling, snapping, raising theirhackles). Other times, they’re more subtle (lip licking, yawning, avoiding eye contact),” Haussmann says. “It’s important to understand what the different visual cues mean so you know if your dog is feeling defensive, overwhelmed, nervous, etc.”\nThe dog park is not the place to learndog obedience. They should already reliably come when called and respond to commands like “drop it.” Says Haussmann: “If your dog doesn’t come unless you pull a piece ofbaconout of your pocket that sends all the other dogs into a frenzy, that could be challenging for everyone involved.”\nYour dog’s first experience with other dogs shouldn’t be at a crowded dog park. It’s best to ease them into social situations — especially when they’re puppies. Haussmann recommends one-on-one playdates andpuppy socialization classesso puppies can learn how to interact before taking them to a park with adult dogs.\nA dog behaviorist schools us on why puppy classes are more about socializing than getting straight As.\nWhat should I do if my dog is exhibiting aggressive behavior?\nIt can be alarming if your dog is acting aggressive at the dog park, or is acting too rough. The main reasons why dogs become aggressive at the park are dominance and prey aggression, both of which can get out of hand (or paw) fast. So it’s important that you know what to do if this occurs: Keep a watchful eye on your dog because usually they will warn another dog with a growl or snap before they become physically aggressive.\nAlso, look out for aggressive physical cues such as standing very straight or direct eye contact. If you hear or notice any of these signs, put a leash on your dog and walk them out of the park. If your dog does get into a fight, remain calm while you try to break it up, keeping your own safety in mind becausedog fights can be dangerous.\nFeeling good about all of the above? Before hitting up the park, read on for some dog park dos and don’ts.\nDog Park Dos\nIf your dog is new to the dog park or tends to get overwhelmed, 10 a.m. on Saturday when the park is packed probably isn’t the best time to go. Opt for off-peak times when the vibe is likely to be more low-key.\n“If you have a dog who’s high energy, you may want to take them for awalkbefore going into the park,” Haussmann says. “That will tire them out a little, so they’re not too over-zealous when they get around the other dogs.”\nNot helicopter-parent close. But close. “Dogs need to learn how to read signs and resolve conflict non-violently on their own,” Haussmann says. “You don’t need to rush in and insert yourself into every situation. But if your dog is clearly bothering other dogs (bullying a young pup, not giving a dog space to get away) your dog may need to come out of the park for a while.”\nTwo animal behavior experts agree it’s usuallyplay fighting. Here’s how you can tell.\nIf you’re not sure if your dog’s style of play is working for another dog, ask the pet parent. If they feel uncomfortable, consider removing your dog so the other pup gets a break. “Dog parks are a community,” Haussman says. “We all need to work together to keep everyone happy and healthy.”\nDogs need their crew. If your pup is playing well with a group of dogs, find their pet parents and see if you can coordinate days and times to come to the park together.\nPicking up poop sucks. Being judged for not picking up poop sucks more. Some parks will have poop bag dispensers on site but be sure you bring your own too, just in case.\nThere will likely be a water source at the park. Still, to avoid any potentially contagious diseases, it’s best to have your own water bowl at the ready.\nThe deadly disease is most common in autumn and late summer. Find out how to keep your pup safe.\nDog Park Don’ts\nBut aren’t treats and toys the best? They are! Just not always at the park. “Dogs can be competitive around food and toys,” Haussmann cautions. “And some dogs can become reactive or aggressive, especially in high-arousal situations when they’re jazzed from playing. Younger dogs, in particular, can struggle when an element of competition gets introduced into the area.”\nRemember, you’re at the park to spend time with your dog. It’s not the place to catch up on emails or scroll through your social feed. Your dog is counting on you to help them stay safe and have fun.\nYour dog should have their vaccinations before heading to the park, but you should also be on the lookout for signs that your pup might not be feeling well. A touch of diarrhea, an isolated bout ofvomiting, or a minor cough may not be anything serious or contagious, but better safe than sorry.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nThink there’s no harm in scooping your dog up when it’s time to take a break? Think again. “Dogs can get freaked out when they see another dog get picked up,” Haussmann says. “They may respond by jumping up or nipping at your dog, and your dog could end up getting hurt.”\nNot every day is a good day to go to the park. If it’s a sizzling day, your pup could be at risk forheat exhaustionor paw injuries from hot surfaces. Freezing days could be uncomfortable or even dangerous for your dog if they’re outside for too long.\nIf you only remember one thing, Haussman says, “Advocate for your dog. That’s one of your most important jobs as a pet parent.” Trips to the park are meant to be fun adventures for your pup. It’s okay to tell people what your dog does or doesn’t like. And if for some reason the dog park just isn’t your dog’s thing, that’s okay too — there are plenty of other ways you can exercise and socialize your dog.\nFAQs (People Also Ask):\nOnce they have had all their shots, yes — but you don’t want your dog’s first socialization experience to be a busy dog park, so ease them in with other social situations first.\nIt’s not a good idea to bring your dog to the park if they’re not socialized — try introducing them to other, more easily controllable social situations.\nIf it is an off-leash park — most are —then you shouldn’t keep your dog on a leash because it can stress out your dog if other dogs are off leash and moving freely.\nOne way to to keep your dog from getting overwhelmed orbecoming frightenedis to make sure they have their own space when they first enter the dog park.\nDogs can become competitive around food and toys, or get aggressive if they’re brought into a dog park, so it’s best not to bring them.\nAlwayspick upyour dog’s poop at the park! Most parks will have poop-bag dispensers to use, but bring your own just in case and dispose of it in a trash can.\nIf you feel comfortable you could talk to the other dog’s owner to ask if they could intervene. If that’s not an option, remove your dog from the park.\nReferences:\nDog Park Etiquette\nDog Park Etiquette\nUnleashing Common Sense\nUnleashing Common Sense\nDog Park Etiquette and Safety\nDog Park Etiquette and Safety\nAnimal Protective Foundation Dog Park Etiquette\nAnimal Protective Foundation Dog Park Etiquette\nDog Park Guidelines and Etiquette\nDog Park Guidelines and Etiquette\nEverything You Need to Know About Dog Parks and Dog Agility Equipment\nEverything You Need to Know About Dog Parks and Dog Agility Equipment\nProper Etiquette at the Dog Park\nProper Etiquette at the Dog Park\nAnimal Hospital West Lake Forest Aggressive Behavior Between Dogs at the Dog Park\nAnimal Hospital West Lake Forest Aggressive Behavior Between Dogs at the Dog Park\nParnell Living Science Dog Park Etiquette Do's and Don't's\nParnell Living Science Dog Park Etiquette Do's and Don't's",

    "page_content": "When it comes to buying a collar for your dog, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the amount of options out there. Do you go with a standard, utilitarian nylon collar with a buckle? One of those elaborate, beadedSusan Alexandra collarsthat could be mistaken forcurrently trending human accessories? Did you know that evenGucci makes collarsnow? Maybe you forgo a collar entirelyin favor of a harness. But then, the spiral begins again: What kind of harness? Back clip? Front clip? Head haltie? The sheer number of possible canine restraints is dizzying.\nThe answer, of course, depends on your dog and their specific needs. But for many dog trainers, walkers, and rescue professionals, one collar has become an indispensable tool for ensuring the safety of dogs who might slip out of a regular collar: the martingale.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThe martingale collar, also known as a “limited-slip collar” or a “Greyhound collar” is a collar with two loops. The first wraps around about three-quarters of the width of the dog’s neck, and the two ends of it are connected by a “control loop,” which can be made of fabric or chain and is where the leash is attached. When the collar is correctly fitted, the design of the martingale allows one to tighten the collar without choking the dog. Below, everything you need to know to determine if a martingale collar is right for your dog and how to adjust the fit to use it correctly.\nWhere Did Martingale Collars Come From?\nIt’s unclear when, exactly, the martingale collar was first invented, but experts agree that it was first used primarily for Sighthounds like Greyhounds, Whippets, and Salukis, who have long, thick necks and narrow heads that regular collars can easily slip over.\nThe term martingale likely comes from a piece of horse tack known as a martingale, which is also known as a “tiedown” or “headcheck,” and is a strap that prevents the horse’s head from whipping so far back that it risks hitting the rider.\nPro tips for boosting the confidence of a scaredy-cat dog.\nHow Are Martingale Collars Used?\nBeyond their popularity with Sighthound guardians, martingales have become a favorite tool among those working in dog rescue as well, because they prevent skittish dogs from slipping out of collars without risk of choking and traumatizing them. (The martingale, to be clear, is not a choke collar — when correctly sized, it tightens just to the width of your dog’s neck, but not more than that.)\nMelissa Giordano, the adoption coordinator for The Sato Project, which rescues, rehabilitates, and rehomes stray dogs from Puerto Rico, says that she’s used martingale collars for almost 15 years, and that they are an essential tool for keeping her organization’s rescues safe. “We fly all of our dogs over from Puerto Rico, so they come off the plane — it’s loud, it’s a new environment, and it’s scary. Sometimes their flight instincts are strong, and they just want to run,” she explained. “So we have to have something that they can’t slip out of, that’s going to be secure but also doesn’t risk injuring them like a traditional choke collar.”\nRobert Haussmann, a certified professional dog trainer, co-founder ofDogboy NYC, andKinshipmember, recommends his clients use martingales in conjunction with other collars or harnesses as a safety precaution. “If I talk to walking companies, I usually encourage them to have some martingale collars as a backup for whatever device their clients are using,” he says. “So if a client is using a no-pull harness, or a head collar, or a traditional harness that closes between the shoulder blades, the martingale can be used as well, just in case there’s an equipment failure.”\nHaussmann uses a martingale with his own dog, who is “shaped like a whippet,” and says it’s a “fantastic” everyday collar for dogs who are already calm and responsive on a leash. Still, he warns against leaning on it too heavily as a training device. Owners of dogs who are easily excitable, or who pull a lot, might be inclined to use the martingale’s tightening ability as a punishment for a dog who pulls. But this punishment, Haussmann warns, can exacerbate a dog’s nervousness and behavioral issues, and add more stress to an already stressful situation.\n“There is no tool that makes up for the relationship between you and your dog, and the work and effort you’re putting into training that dog,” he says. “A lot of times, people use devices like that to suppress behaviors instead of teaching their dogs appropriate behaviors.”\nDog trainer Pat Miller’s pro tips for preventing your pup from darting out the door.\nWhat to Know Before Getting a Martingale Collar\nThe most important thing to keep in mind when getting any collar, but especially a martingale, is fit. Melissa Giordano says that whichever type of collar you get your dog, a good rule of thumb is that you want to be able to fit two fingers underneath it when the dog is wearing it. “You want it to be snug but comfortable, so the dog has room to breathe.”\nMartingales come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and patterns (for sighthounds, for example, there are thicker collars that help distribute pressure around their long necks) so finding the right one for your dog may take some measuring and shopping around online. Girodano also says that, for safety reasons, she personally prefers a martingale with a quick-release buckle. That way, she says, if the dog’s collar gets caught on something and they start choking, it’s easy to free them without having to find scissors to cut the collar off.\nOnce you get the collar, make sure to give your dog time to get comfortable with it before you take them out on a walk. Haussmann recommends letting your dog smell the collar, clicking the buckle so they get used to the sound, and having them wear it for brief periods around your home so they can get used to how it feels.\nAnd remember, Haussmann notes, to pair any collar or harness with regular training: “Once your dog knows how to walk well on a leash and is doing a great job, then by all means, [a martingale] can be your full-time collar.”\nThe Best Martingale Collars",

    },
    "page_content": "Jumping into the pool or lake after a sweaty day in the sun is one of life’s great pleasures, and it’s only natural to want to share the feeling with your pup. But of course, some dogs won’t be quite ready to take the plunge. If you’re looking to help your four-legged friend finally get the hang of the doggy paddle, these tips from dog trainer and dock jumping expertAngelica Steinker, M.Edshould help them acclimate to the water.\nFirst of all: Can all dogs swim?\nWhile most dogs should be able to get around in the water with the help of a life jacket, some breeds are better equipped to take a dip than others. Dogs that were originally bred for water retrieval (like Labs and Golden Retrievers) will usually take to the water more than ones whose builds make it difficult to float (like Bulldogs or Dachshunds). With that being said, Steinker has found that some pups are just born with a “water gene,” despite their breed, while others just have no interest in getting in. Giving these water-wary dogs a personal swim lesson is a great way to expose them to swimming in a safe and supportive environment.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHow to help your dog get the hang of it.\nThe secret of any effective swim lesson is positive reinforcement. If you consistently do fun activities in and around the water, your dog should slowly but surely start to gain more confidence swimming. Here are five pro tips to get you started.\nSome like it hot (but not most dogs). Here are the season’s health hazards, from fleas to foxtails.\n“A life vest is a very important part of introducing your dog to swimming because you never know if your dog is going to be the one that’s going to sink like a rock,” says Steinker. She recommends giving them a chance to run around in their vest on land first to make sure they’re comfortable moving in it. “If they’re going to have a freezing stress response to a life vest, that needs to be worked through separately before you can introduce your dog to the water,” she notes.\nIf you can get your hands on a kiddie pool, Steinker says that those tend to be perfect for getting dogs acclimated to the water since they’re so easy to drain and fill back up. You can place your dog in the empty pool and gradually add water—letting them play with the hose or splash around as you do—until they are surrounded. Smaller dogs will even get the chance to overcome the shock of floating in these small, contained pools.\nOnce they get used to a kiddie pool, they can move up to a full-sized one next. If you have one in your backyard, be sure to start your dog at the pool exit and turn them so they get experience wading out of the water from every angle. “That way, if they do slip and fall into the pool accidentally, they can orient themselves and they’ll know where to go,” says Steinker. Even after your dog is comfortable swimming, though, you should never leave them in the pool unattended.\nSteinker has found that dogs tend to be more fearful of swimming in clear water than they do in murkier beaches or lakes, so starting them in a pool will help set them up for success elsewhere (though a new swimming environment will always take some getting used to).\nSo you definitely need these Funboy x Bark pet floats.\nTo start, your swimming lessons should only include you, your pup, and a favorite toy or treat. Minimizing outside distractions will keep them focused on the task at hand: having fun in the water!\nWhether you’re in a kiddle or full-sized pool, try to get in the water yourself to show your pet what a safe and happy swim looks like. If they are wary of wading in, entice them with their favorite toy or treat. And be sure to reward them every time they wade a little deeper or conquer another step down the pool stairs.\nIf they’re still not interested in getting in, you can always end the lesson and try again tomorrow. The one thing you don’t want to do is lose your cool and nudge or push them into the water; this will only startle them and make them even less inclined to get in. “This is a game that we want to play with our dogs. If you want your dog to play the game with you, they really need to engage in the behavior voluntarily,” Steinker cautions. “And if you do any sort of pushing, it’s not voluntary!”\nThe secret to a successful swim is warming your dog up beforehand. Have them run around outside to work up a sweat before jumping into the cool, refreshing water.\nFinally, treats and squeaky toys can totally transform a swim lesson. Check out a few that Steinker has seen a lot of success with, and how she uses them, below.\nThese tips and tricks should help most dogs wade deeper than ever before. But if you’ve tried them all and your pup is still skittish around the water, they may just not be a candidate for swimming. Steinker notes that rescues, in particular, may have an abuse history that makes them water-averse. In that case, she says, “The kindest thing to do is just abort mission.”\nSwimming essentials for pool time.\nThis floating toy is super enticing to dogs. Toss it in the water and watch your pup’s fetching instincts flutter-kick into high gear.\nInvest in a durable pouch to hold your water-shy dog’s favorite treats.

    "page_content": "Dog recall training setbacks can be very disheartening. But when a dog doesn’t respond as you expect, it is usually a situation in which a dog is asked to do something that they had not yet been trained to do. Responding appropriately to the cue to come to you when there is nothing particularly new or interesting to distract them is totally different than returning to you when someone else is feeding themtreats. So, how can you know when your dog has really “gotten it” — so that you can be sure they will come back, no matter what?\nAchieving Perfect Recall\nThe real secret to perfect recall training is that there are 100 steps involved in teaching a dog to return so that they can do it inanysituation. Step one for teaching dog recall may be calling your dog to come from five feet away in your living room, with nothing else going on but you and your meatballs, and step 100 is calling your dog to come when they are 500 feet away, chasing a deer.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nMany people change from step five to step 95 without realizing what a challenge this is for a dog. This is the equivalent of asking a student to go from addition and subtraction to reinventing calculus, figuring that the student already knows how to do math, so what’s the problem?\nUpgrading your pup’s recall training from accidental tointentional.\nTeaching a dog what a recall cue means is often the easiest part. Proofing the dog to that cue, or getting the dog to respond a recall cue in all situations, is the challenge. Just because your dog has good recall and knows how to come when called when nothing else has captivated their attention doesn’t mean that they can do it when they are really enthralled by the smell of a rabbit, the food they are eating, or their best play buddy. Training your dog to come away from these distractions requires that you train them to do so in a series of steps of gradually increasing difficulty.\nHow to Teach a Dog Recall\nAvoiding recall setbacks by not skipping steps is a challenge that requires great discipline on your part. The key is that throughout your dog recall training work, you must not call your dog unless you are 100 percent confident that they will respond. For example, if someone is giving your pet treats, don’t try to call them back. Most trainers would tell you that the odds of success were not in your favor. Rather than call out “come back,” a wiser course of action is to simply go get your dog. This is not convenient, I know. It requires only letting your dog off-leash in areas where you can go get them if they don’t come, but it is only temporary.\nWhen you call a dog to come and they don’t respond, how you handle the situation is important for your future success with dog recall training. If you do nothing, or if you keep calling them over and over, you are teaching them not to respond unless they feel like it. Either they learn that they don’t have to come because there is no consequence for not coming, or they learn to tune out the “come” cue; it becomes background noise and loses its meaning to them.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nOne possible response is to go up to them, show them the meatball treat they could have had, and then walk away. Another is to take them out of the park so they learn that if they do not respond, they do not get to stay at the park.\nA third possibility is to immediately set up a similar situation as a training opportunity. Put the meatball right up to their nose, move a few feet away and call them to come. Lure them with the treat if necessary — anything to get them to come away from the distraction, and then reinforce them for doing so. Then, allow them to go back to the distraction. Allowing your dog to get both reinforcements from you and what they gave up in order to come to you makes responding to your cue a winning situation all around.\nThe most important factor in all dog training, but especially training dog recall, is setting up winning situations for your dog over and over again in all sorts of contexts. That’s what proofing a dog for a training cue is all about.\nDuring training, have something better than what they gave up, so they learn that coming to you is always worthwhile. This means that if someone is giving them liver biscotti, you give them chicken. If they give them a lot of nice petting attention, you give them a belly rub. If they are luring them with an ordinary ball, you reinforce them with a super bouncy ball.\nKinshipCollective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a stubborn pup to listen up.\nIt’s hard to know for sure that your dog is recall proofed to respond to a cue inanysituation if you have not explicitly practiced and trained them to handle a variety of environments. That said, the more situations and types of distractions in which your dog has learned to respond to the cue, the more likely it is they will respond appropriately in a novel context.\nSix Dog Recall Training Steps\nCertified Applied Animal Behaviorist Dr. Patricia B. McConnell breaks recall training into six important recall training steps.\nIt’s hard to compete once a dog has learned that ignoring you means he gets to chase a deer or snarf down a McBurger wrapper.\nStart teaching a recall when you can’t lose. No distractions. Your dog is practically beside you. The perfect reinforcement.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s pro tips for walking a pup that wantsto chase everything that moves.\nIf your dog was focused on a chipmunk, but turns their head to you when you call, you’ve won half the battle.\nIt only took me a couple of years of working with dogs to realize that, as mentioned above, dog recall includes several behaviors. 1) Stop what you are doing. 2) Change your focus onto me. 3) Turn around toward me. 4) Come toward me. 5)All the way.\nReinforce, reinforce, reinforce. Never stop reinforcing recall behavior. Not every time, and not necessarily for responses when all the stars were aligned, but running and chasing is such a natural behavior for a dog that stopping a chase and coming back to you is basically a circus trick.\nAdolescent dogs are famous for forgetting everything they’ve learned as a puppy, so don’t hesitate to go back to step on (prevention) for a few months, even if your dog was a star pupil as a youngster.\nHere are some simple steps to pry your pup away from thatonespot in the yard they’re obsessed with.\nIf you call your dog, and they visit with or slam into other dogs or even run in the other direction before getting to you, is that a perfect recall? No, but is that behavior you should reward? Though it feels weird to reward a dog who takes so long to respond, you should definitely do so. While it isn’t the perfect recall you were looking for, you’ll need to reward your dog for leaving whatever was so interesting to return to you. If you don’t make them glad they did, they will be even less likely to do so the next time.\nEventually, with hard work and training, all situations are sufficiently similar that they can be said to be “fully proofed” for recall training. Some dogs get there faster than others, but for virtually every dog, it takes a lot of practice in a wide range of situations involving different places, with different distractions, and from different distances.\nTips on Teaching Your Dog A Reliable Recall\nTraining your dog to reliably return to you when called — any time, anywhere — could literally save their life, so it is no exaggeration to say that a dog’s recall is the most important behavior you will ever teach them. Here are a few dog recall training tips.\nCue theSchoolhouse Rock!because learning can be fun.\nIf your dog learns that coming to you is fun, they will be more likely to respond. Call them to play tug orfetch, or let them chase you; even just running in the opposite direction often works because almost all dogs love to chase. (Don’t chase your dog; they will learn to move away when you approach, and that can ruin their recall.)\nIt’s more challenging for some dogs to learn to come when called, and while there are exceptions, here are a few breed generalizations that usually fit. Dogs bred to work closely with people and pay attention to them during that work — Collies, Shepherds, and Retrievers — are often easier to train with dog recall. Dogs bred to work independently — Terriers, scent and sight hounds, Mastiffs, and Pointers — often require more practice and time for the recall to be completely proofed.\nIf your dog has learned that the word “come” has no meaning and they ignore it, consider changing the verbal cue. If a word has become irrelevant, it is often more efficient to start over. Common recall words include “here,” “front,” and “ven” (Spanish for “come”).\nPractice in many contexts is important. Place, a key factor, is particularly hard for many dogs to generalize. A recall in your yard is completely different than a recall inside the house, and a recall at the park is completely different than a recall at home — inside or out. Other factors include distance (how far you are from your dog when calling them) and distraction level (food, other people, sounds, traffic, toys, or other dogs). Plan to train your dog everywhere — that way, they will be more likely to respond, no matter what.",

    "page_content": "Dogs can be the best (and cutest) playmates, sidekicks, and companions for kiddos. And together, they create an endless supply of Instagram-worthy moments. But you know that. That’s why you’re about to grow your family by one dog! The key to kids and dogs forming that one-of-a-kind friendship is establishing trust and respect. Your dog needs to know that they can feel safe and have fun around your child, and vice versa. How do you accomplish that? We asked a vet and a trainer to help show you the way.\nParents, it all starts with you.\nFrom navigating the first introduction to monitoring your dog’s settling in period to everything that comes after, it’s up to you to set the tone. “First, the adults need to trainthemselvesto do the right thing,” veterinarian Dr. Susannah Teran explains. “They are ultimately responsible for keeping everyone safe and creating a positive environment. Then, if the kids are old enough to understand and follow through, teach them the rules. After that, you can work on training the dog. That’s the mindset to have to be the most successful.”\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nMake sure your dog has a safe space.\nBefore your dog comes home, carve out a spot in the house that’s just for them. Itcould be a crateor a quiet corner of a room with a dog bed. Tell the kids that area is off-limits to them. (And folks, it’s off limits to you too.) Your dog will need to know that there’s a place they can always go when they need some alone time.We can all relate.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nTake it slow.\nChances are, your kids are going to be very excited to meet your new pup. Your dog, however, may be feeling nervous or overwhelmed. “To start, have your dog on a leash and bring them into one room of the home,” recommends Valerie Peck, a certified dog trainer. “Let your dog explore the area slowly. Instead of your kids running up to the dog, wait until your dog chooses to approach them. If you have a baby, you can let the dog sniff some of the baby’s items to get them used to their scent.” While everyone is checking each other out, try to keep the vibe mellow. “If anyone starts getting wound up, it’s time to take a break. I also strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with dog body language. Understanding how your dog is reacting will help you make decisions about how to manage the introduction.”\nTeach kids how to pet politely.\nWhen first petting a dog, kids should avoid touching the dog’s head. Teach them instead to pet the dog on their side or back. It’s also important for kids to understand that petting a dog is a privilege. It’s up to the dog to decide if they want that kind of attention.\nPeck recommends teaching kids the two-second rule: “Have your child pet the dog for two seconds, then stop and wait. If the dog comes back and wants more attention, your child can pet them again. But if the dog walks away or doesn’t re-engage, don’t force the interaction.” Here’s something that may be hard to hear: not every dog is a fan of petting. We know. It seems incomprehensible, but it’s true. “I always tell parents to show their kids other ways they can engage with the dog. Ideas include playing with toys,giving them treats,or being the one to set down their food dish.”\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nTry not to leave toys lying around.\nYour dog may not want to share their toys with your kids. And your kids may not want to share theirs with the dog. And you probably don’t like stuff all over the floor, anyway. To avoid any confrontations (and tripping hazards), don’t leave toys lying around when no one is using them. But for the inevitable times when your dogdoesmanage to get ahold of your kid’s favorite stuffed animal, “it’s beneficial to teach your dog commands such as ‘drop it’ and ‘leave it,’” Peck says. “When starting this training, I recommend having a treat jar in every room of the house. That way, you’ll have one on the ready whenever a teachable moment arises.”\nAlways, always supervise.\nAs your dog settles into their new home, they’ll start to feel more comfortable around your littles. Still, dogs and kids need adult supervision long after the initial introduction. “In my opinion, a baby should never be left alone with a dog, no matter how much confidence you have in your dog,” Dr. Teran says. “Same with a toddler. Despite your best efforts to teach good habits, toddlers and young children can’t be trusted to do what they are supposed to. It’s up to the parent to actively supervise when kids are interacting with the dog.”\nThis is pretty important stuff, but if you nail the intro, your kiddo and pup will be inseparable in no time.",

What the blogs and books don’t always tell you is that potty training is hard, it can feel frustrating, and every dog will take a different amount of time to get the hang of the routine. But fear not: if you can get into the right headspace and accept that setbacks and accidents are all part of the journey, you can approach potty training with confidence.\nPotty training is all about that consistency, patience, andpositive reinforcement. Just when you think your pup may never figure it out, one day it all clicks and you realize that all your efforts have paid off. The keys to that consistency and reinforcement include establishing a set feeding and bathroom schedule, using a consistent cue (like “potty”), and immediately praising or giving a treat when they pee or poop outside.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nYou’ve got this! Just be sure to breathe and keep your eye on the big picture. Read on to learn lots of helpful tips and tricks for potty training a puppy.\nCreate a consistent training environment\nIt cannot be overstated how important consistency is during potty training. The repetition of the same routine, familiar sites, and cues over and over again helps your pup connect the dots and learn. For this to be effective,everyonemust follow the same routine, cues, and schedule. Be sure to communicate with your family,dog walkersand any other caretakers what your plan is so that everyone follows along. Some factors that should be part of your training plan include:\nSelect a spot that you will use for potty training and use that spot every time. Staying in one spot takes away the novelty of new sites and smells that may distract your pup from the task at hand. Over time, the spot will also retain some smells from their previous pee and poops, too, which can serve as a reminder to them as well.\nPick a cuethat you will use to associate with potty time for your pup. It can be anything as long as it is a simple, one-word cue that everyone will use, every time.\nWhenever you are indoors with your pup, limit the space they can access to avoid accidents in the most undesirable areas. This is most important if your pup is unsupervised; consider creating apuppy penor other confined area to use in these cases or keep your puppy on a leash and in sight.\nPreparation is key. Be sure you have everything on-hand that you need for potty training. Also be sure you have the supplies with you whenever you are taking your pup outside.\nTreats and rewards:You need to celebrate each successful pottybig timeto help your pup make the connection between peeing and pooping in their designated spot and getting a big reward.

Has your puppy just woken up, played, or eaten? Go right outside. In the first few days of potty training, you’re hoping to get lucky by taking them outside at just the right moment.\nFor your puppy, it will feel like a coincidence at first that they peed or pooped while outside, but the more often you catch those coincidences and reward them, the more they will connect the dots. General guidelines based on age include (note that maximum hold time applies to dogs who are home alone, andmaximumis the operable word here):\nTwo to three months old:Take them out every 30 to 60 minutes, depending on what other activities are going on such as meal times and naps; maximum hold time: three to four hours\nTwo to three months old:Take them out every 30 to 60 minutes, depending on what other activities are going on such as meal times and naps; maximum hold time: three to four hours\nFour months old:Take them out every one to two hours; maximum hold time: five hours\nFour months old:Take them out every one to two hours; maximum hold time: five hours\nFive months:Take them out every two hours; maximum hold time: six hours\nFive months:Take them out every two hours; maximum hold time: six hours\nSix to nine months:Take them out every two to three hours, depending on feeding and nap times; maximum hold time: no longer than six hours\nSix to nine months:Take them out every two to three hours, depending on feeding and nap times; maximum hold time: no longer than six hours\nAdult dogs:Take them out every two to three hours while potty training.

This is the opposite of training techniques that use punishment.\nPunishment involves applying a negative association to something you do not want your dog to do; this could be yelling or scolding, physical punishments, or isolating or confining your dog after they do something wrong. These forms of training are never recommended. They induce fear and stress in dogs, which can interfere with their ability to learn. Punishment can have long-term effects on their behavior, bond with humans, and trust in you as well.\nPositive-reinforcement training, however, is highly effective, especially when you tailor it to use the rewards that are most high-value to your pup. It makes training fun and strengthens the bond between dogs and their humans. This includes:\nFigure out what treat is most valuable to your pup. You’ll want to save their favorite foods just for training sessions, and only make them available as a reward for potty training.\nMany dogs also respond well to verbal praise and can also beclicker-trainedto associate their behaviors with rewards.\nOther dogs may respond best to a special toy or other high-value reward like petting. Whatever is most valuable to your pup is best to motivate them.\nFor a dog to connect their behavior with a specific reward, the payout has to be nearly immediate. Aim to reward your pup as soon as they potty in the designated spot or within thirty seconds. If there is a longer delay between the action and the reward, it can be difficult for dogs to make the connection.\nAdvanced bell training\nFinding a way for your dog to communicate to you that they need to potty is extremely helpful. Some dogs may naturally find a way to communicate by sitting by the door, barking at you, or grabbing their leash. You can also teach your puppy to ring a bell when they need to pee or poop.\nChoose a bell that your dog can either nudge with their nose or swat with their paw. It should be easy for them to reach and make a clear sound with minimal manipulation. Sleigh bell styles that can be hung right next to the door at your dog’s height are a good example. To teach your pup to use the bells, follow these guidelines:\nNew things can be scary to a puppy, so let them sniff and explore it (don’t let themplay tug with it). Once you have your puppy engaging with the bell, you can reward them with a treat each time they touch the bell.\nOnce your puppy is willingly touching the bell, you will transition to rewarding them when they nudge it hard enough to make a sound. Hang the bell in its desired location near the door and start to combine your cues for potty with rewarding your dog for ringing the bell. Then immediately open the door and take them out for their potty break.\nWhenever you take your dog out for a potty break, use your verbal cue to let them know it’s potty time and reward them if they ring the bell. At first, you can ring the bell to strengthen their association with the sound and potty time. Anytime your dog rings the bell, be sure to reinforce the behavior by taking them out for a brief potty break.\nPuppies are very smart, so you’ll want to make sure you are training your puppy to ring the bellonlyto go to the bathroom and not to go outside and play. Keep the potty trips short and intentionally boring, and saveplay timefor other outings.\nHow to handle accidents\nYou can guarantee that accidents will happen during potty training. Think of it as part of the learning process for both you and your puppy and not a failure of any kind. It is important to handle accidents calmly to avoid setbacks in potty training. Some important points to keep in mind include:\nResist the urge to scold or punish your dog for having an accident.\nWhy punishment doesn’t work:This can lead dogs to associate peeing or pooping with fear and anxiety, and they may be more likely to try to use the bathroom in secret. This can lead to more accidents, because they may hide their signals that they need to go, leading to missed opportunities to take them outside and strengthen that association.\nWhy punishment doesn’t work:This can lead dogs to associate peeing or pooping with fear and anxiety, and they may be more likely to try to use the bathroom in secret. This can lead to more accidents, because they may hide their signals that they need to go, leading to missed opportunities to take them outside and strengthen that association.\nRedirecting vs. scolding:Instead of scolding your pup and scaring them if they are caught in the act, try to calmly and quietly pick them up and take them to their potty spot to reinforce the connection. If you can’t catch them in time to redirect them outside, quietly clean up the mess and move on.\nRedirecting vs. scolding:Instead of scolding your pup and scaring them if they are caught in the act, try to calmly and quietly pick them up and take them to their potty spot to reinforce the connection. If you can’t catch them in time to redirect them outside, quietly clean up the mess and move on.\nBuild trust:Punishments, like scolding or sticking a dog’s nose in their mess, create fear and anxiety for dogs. This erodes their trust in their humans and can make them avoidant and more fearful in general, leading to additional behavioral problems. Instead, by rewarding your pup for the behaviors youdowant, you can create positive associations. This builds trust and confidence and strengthens the bond between dogs and humans, all while effectively training them.\nBuild trust:Punishments, like scolding or sticking a dog’s nose in their mess, create fear and anxiety for dogs.

This builds trust and confidence and strengthens the bond between dogs and humans, all while effectively training them.\nEnzymatic cleaners arethe most effectiveat completely eliminating the odor of urine and poop after an accident. Dog’s noses are much more sensitive than ours, and if they can still pick up the scent, they are more likely to return to that spot in the future. Other pets in the home may also start peeing or pooping in that spot if they can smell urine or poop there.\nYou shouldn’t make them cross their legs for long!\nCommon potty training challenges\nIt’s common to run into hiccups throughout the potty training process. A few challenges that pet parents often encounter are:\nYou’ll need to give extra consideration to how you’llmanage overnightsduring potty training. Young puppies won’t be able to hold their urine all night, so you’ll have to have a backup plan for them. This can be aconfined area, like a crate or pen with puppy pads.\nAs they get used to only peeing and pooping outside, they may cry to be let out if they have to pee. If you can take them out for a quick potty stop overnight, you may be able to reinforce their training and avoid a messy cleanup in the morning.\nIf you have to wait for an elevator or climb multiple flights of stairs to get outside, it can make potty training a bit more challenging. Your pup may have more accidents at first when they have to go urgently and can’t wait to get all the way outside.\nFor smaller dogs, you may want to consider puppy pad training them first or using a product likepuppy potty grassto avoid frequent trips outside. Once they are trained to use their spot indoors and old enough to hold their pee a bit longer, you can work on training them to go outdoors.\nIf you feel like your pup is starting to get the hang of potty training only to backslide and start having accidents again, you’re not alone. There can be lots ofreasons for inconsistent progress, including medical problems, changes in their routine, or certain developmental leaps. Stick with a consistent approach and predictable schedule.\nIf you feel like you can’t get back on track, be sure to speak with a vet to rule out a medical problem.A behavioristcan also help you trouble-shoot any training challenges once medical issues are ruled out.\nMedical conditions can also add challenges to potty training. This can include problems that cause more urgent, frequent peeing and pooping such asdiarrhea, digestive problems,urinary tract infections(UTIs), or other conditions that causefrequent urination.\nProgress can also be affected by medical conditions that are not directly related to peeing and pooping including injuries, fevers, congenital problems and more. Any condition that causes pain, or affects their energy levels, appetite, and behavior can interfere with learning and may make it more difficult for them to hold their pee and poop. Be sure to see a vet for any medical problems that arise and expect that you may need to put potty training on hold until they are feeling better.\nBottom line\nPotty training can take a while for some dogs so it is important to approach it with an organized plan and lots of patience.\nPotty training can take a while for some dogs so it is important to approach it with an organized plan and lots of patience.\nConsistency is the key; this means sticking to a reliable schedule, using specific cues, and lots of positive reinforcement to help your dog understand what you want them to do.\nConsistency is the key; this means sticking to a reliable schedule, using specific cues, and lots of positive reinforcement to help your dog understand what you want them to do.\nBe prepared for setbacks and see a vet if you are concerned there may be a medical condition interfering with your dog’s potty training.\nBe prepared for setbacks and see a vet if you are concerned there may be a medical condition interfering with your dog’s potty training.\nFAQs\nAll puppies are different, so it’s hard to provide an exact timeline. Your consistency also plays a huge factor in how fast your puppy learns. Younger puppies may need more time, especially because they physically can’t hold their urine for long stretches. With consistent training, it can take between four to six months for your puppy to be potty trained, but some puppies may take longer.\nUse the same general guidelines for outdoor potty training but the designated spot for them to urinate and defecate will be the puppy pad instead of an outdoor spot. Place your puppy on a pee pad routinely according to the schedule above. You may want to put their leash on each time to serve as a cue that it’s potty time and to help them stay in place on the pad. Reward them for using the bathroom on the pee pad.\nPuppies can generallyhold their peefor the number of months they are old plus or minus one. So, a four month old puppy can typically hold their pee for about three to five hours. You should always take a puppy right out to the bathroom after they have just woken up, played, or eaten, even if less time has elapsed, as these activities often trigger the urge.\nYes, it’s important to learn your puppies “tells” when potty training. Look out for what your puppy does right before peeing or pooping and if you see those signs, take them right to their potty spot. They may walk around in a circle, sniff the floor, start barking, or become restless.\nReferences\nCalder, Christine. “5 Steps to Successfully Housetrain Your Puppy or Adult Dog.”Veterinary Partner. 23 April 2024.\nCalder, Christine. “5 Steps to Successfully Housetrain Your Puppy or Adult Dog.”Veterinary Partner. 23 April 2024.\nRooney, Nicola, et al. “Training methods and owner–dog interactions: Links with dog behaviour and learning ability.”Applied Animal Behavior Science, vol. 132, no. 3-4, July 2011, pp: 169-177.\nRooney, Nicola, et al. “Training methods and owner–dog interactions: Links with dog behaviour and learning ability.”Applied Animal Behavior Science, vol. 132, no. 3-4, July 2011, pp: 169-177.\nVieira de Castro, Ana Catarina, et al. “Improving dog training methods: Efficacy and efficiency of reward and mixed training methods.”PloS one, vol. 16, no. 2, 19 February 2012, e0247321.\nVieira de Castro, Ana Catarina, et al. “Improving dog training methods: Efficacy and efficiency of reward and mixed training methods.”PloS one, vol. 16, no. 2, 19 February 2012, e0247321.",

    "page_content": "So, how did those early puppy days go for you? Did your dog miss out on socialization during their critical early months? Maybe you were advised to keep your puppy isolated for health reasons, or your work schedule had you so swamped that nothing went according to plan, or youadopted an adult dogwho didn’t get off to the best start in life for who-knows-what-reason. No matter how your dog wound up with a socialization deficit, there’s a good chance you frantically Googled it and are now worried about your pup’s prospects for happiness.\nBut it’s actually not all gloom and doom. There are things you can do instead of throwing your hands up in despair. Here’s the intel on how to most effectively — and kindly — teach your dog that the world isn’t such a scary place.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nFirst, don’t panic.\nSeriously, all is not lost. Sure, this isn’t the ideal situation, but your dog can still have a wonderfully fulfilling life. Tons of dogs who weren’t socialized “by the book,” experience joy every day, and so do their people. The key to making that a reality for dogs who have not had the benefit of proper socialization is the same as for almost all goals: work slowly and patiently. Rather than pushing your dog, accept that they will determine how fast you get where you want to go. Setting an arbitrary deadline for their progress is not helpful. There’s never been a circumstance better suited for the phrase, “It’s the journey, not the destination.”\nTuning in to your senior’s needs.\nRemember the purpose of socialization.\nThe aim is to expose your dog to a variety of objects, social partners, sounds, sights, and experiences in a positive and non-threatening way. During the early months of their lives (especially from three to 12 weeks, which technically represents the socialization stage of development), puppies are really good at accepting anything they encounter in a non-scary way. It’s super-easy during this critical period for dogs to get used to new things if the new things are connected to happy experiences. (“That man with the funny hat gives metreats!” Or, “This floor has a weird feeling, but it’s fun toplay fetchon it!”)\nIt’s generally harder for dogs to adjust to novelty after the socialization window has closed, though the better the socialization was, the easier it is for them to generalize. (“Oh, another peculiar hat — that’s cool.” Or, “Wow, this floor is different than the others — that’s fine.”) For adult dogs who did not have those good experiences early on, learning to accept new things and be comfortable in the world takes more effort, but progress can be made and can continue to be made throughout their lives.\nIt’s kind of like learning a language. It’s much easier for babies and young children than it is for adults — almost effortless with the right exposure. But adults can and do learn foreign languages all the time. The degree to which they master the language depends on their natural abilities and the time and effort they put in.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a shy pup to go from wallflower to social butterfly.\nKeep experiences positive.\nThe most important part of making up for lost socialization opportunities is to keep it positive. Your dog can learn to accept novel situations and experiences or become less fearful of them by having many, many positive experiences.\nFor example, let’s say your dog didn’t meet children early in their life and now finds them terrifying. They can learn to be OK around children if you begin with a child who’s too far away to upset them. When they see a calm child down the block or on the other side of the park, give them a treat. Do that enough times, and your dog will start to associate the sight of a child with a reward. That makes seeing a child a positive experience, and that’s great.\nOver time, you can gradually — and the operative word here isgradually— have your dog in situations with a child who is closer, or with multiple children, in ways that don’t upset them but instead, continue to teach your dog to be happy about seeing children. Those positive experiences are critical for success.\nWhich comes first: a nervous person or a nervous pup?\nConversely, you cannot help your dog become comfortable around children by exposing them to negative experiences — say, with a child a few feet away or a nearby gaggle of children running, screaming, and throwing their backpacks around. That’s too much for most dogs, well-socialized or not, and no number of treats can make it into a positive experience. Those negative experiences work against the goal of helping your dog be comfortable around kids by reinforcing the idea they already have about children being terrifying.\nGo slowly and don’t rush your dog.\nHelping your dog succeed takes many steps, and there is nothing to be gained by rushing through them. In fact, rushing your pup is counterproductive. Let them guide your timeline rather than the other way around. If they’re handling a situation well, great. If not, get your dog out of it. Accept that they are providing you with an opportunity to practice your own patience.\nIf you force them to be too close to something or spend too much time in a context in which they’re uncomfortable, you will only get in the way of their progress; you will not accelerate it. Any time you’re trying to help your dog overcome a fear or discomfort, you must be willing to retreat, even if you don’t want to.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nIdeally, you can keep the situation positive and quit while you’re ahead, but if that fails, you must remove them. Protecting your dog from situations that cause your pup distress is a great kindness. Work with your dog where they are, exposing them to new things in ways that work for your pup without trying to expose them to the whole world at once.\nAdjust your expectations.\nIf your adult dog missed out on puppy socialization, they’re taking a different route than they would have with the benefit of those early experiences. Don’t expect them to be a social butterfly who handles absolutely everything with the greatest of ease. Frankly, dogs with perfect socialization histories don’t often end up that way, and it’s even less likely for a dog who didn’t have such opportunities. Remember, the goal is a dog who is safe and happy, comfortable with most of the things and people they encounter in life. Your pup doesn’t have to be a happy-go-lucky dog without a care in the world to be incredibly fortunate and enjoy life to its fullest.\nDon’t try to do this on your own.\nThere are many resources to help a dog who needs to learn to be comfortable and unafraid, includingbooks, webinars, andwebsites. Make use of them. Many focus on helpingfearful dogs. That’s because most dogs who were not well-socialized are fearful of various aspects of the world, whether it’s cats, other dogs, people, carpeting, stairs, or the sound of cars.\nDo these things to help your pup (and your guests) feel chill.\nSeek out individualized help. A qualified trainer or behaviorist can teach you how to use the principles of classical conditioning along with the best treats and toys to help your dog make positive associations between new things and feeling good. It may not be as quick as if they had had those exposures as a puppy, but they can still make them.\nTake advantage of what they can already handle.\nFor example, many dogs have not been well-socialized with people but are verycomfortable with other dogs. Take advantage of that and go new places with a dog buddy. If one isn’t already living in your house, perhaps you can borrow a dog, or a friend and their dog can come along on outings.\nOr maybe they had what some would describe as “no socialization,” but that’s not actually accurate. Did they meet a couple of people? Hear high winds blowing or walk on grass as well as pavement? All of these exposures are helpful and make them very different from a dog who truly had no socialization at all. There are rare and heartbreaking examples of dogs who’ve had no human or canine interaction during the first six months of their lives. While these dogs are much more challenging to rehabilitate and are unlikely to make as much progress as most dogs, the principles are the same.\nRemember that many dogs thrive even without ideal socialization experiences, and there’s always time to help your dog achieve many of the benefits of socialization. It’s essential to adjust your expectations based on the start they had in life, but that doesn’t mean you should give up on them. The effort requires patience, time, and a realistic setting of expectations. Go slowly, keep experiences positive, be diligent about helping your dog handle things that alarm them, and protect them from situations that could overwhelm them. Plenty of dogs who were not socialized in a textbook manner are filled with love and joy every day, and your dog can be one of them.",

    "page_content": "If you spend any time on YouTube, you know that dogs are best friends with each other, they love to snuggle with cats, and a parrot walking on their head is their idea of a good time. It’s all very magical and happy. Except it’s not true — at least, it’s not true ofeverydog,everytime.\nSometimes a new dog will hit it off with your other pets right away; other times, one or both parties need a little (or a lot) of convincing. Ultimately, you can’t control the type of relationship your pets will have with each other. But like any good matchmaker, you can increase the chance of success with a carefully orchestrated introduction. When you bring your new dog home, try these strategies to get everyone off to a good start.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nPay attention to body language\nWhen you introduce your new pup to your other dog (or another pet), you’re going to need some sense of how the meeting is going. Unfortunately, dogs can’t talk. But, theycantell you a lot with their body language — you just need to know what to look for. “Understanding body language is going to give you key information about how your dog is feeling in any given moment, and that will impact the choices you make,” says Dr. Susannah Teran. “If you can tell that your dog is relaxed and happy, great! The introduction can continue. But if you seesigns of fear or aggression,you’ll want to intervene before the situation escalates.”\nStart in neutral territory\nThe last thing you want when introducing dogs is an instant turf war. Rather than bringing your new dog directly into your home — where your other dog may feel territorial — let them meet in a neutral location. With the help of a friend or family member, walk the dogs on leashes in a nearby park or neighborhood. They may be hesitant to interact at first, and that’s okay. As they get more comfortable, they’ll start to engage. Let them check each other out for a few seconds, then pull them apart and give them a little space. As long as they are both showing positive body language, you can let them engage for longer periods and then bring them home.\nTwo animal behavior experts agree it’s usuallyplay fighting. Here’s how you can tell.\nTake it slow with cats and other small animals\nCurious how to introduce a dog to a cat? Start by having them in separate rooms. Let them get used to each other’s smell, then allow them to see each other through a baby gate or screen. When they’re ready to meet face-to-face, have your dog on a leash, and make sure your cat can get away if they want to. Valerie Peck, a certified dog trainer, has this pro tip: “You don’t want them to meet if your dog is on high alert or overly interested in the cat. If your dog is whining or scratching at the door trying to get to the cat, wait until their excitement level has lowered before doing the introduction.” A similar approach works for other small pets. Let your pup get used to the smells and sounds of the other animal before you start face-to-face introductions — always with your dog on a leash.\nBe careful with food, toys, and other resources\nTo help avoid conflicts, make sure all pets have their own food dishes, water bowls, and beds. Initially, feed them in separate rooms and don’t leave toys or any of their favorite items lying around. “I recommend being cautious with things like food and chews for the first three months,” says Peck. “It takes about that long for a new dog to feel comfortable in a home. And if they’re not fully settled, their tendency to guard their stuff might be higher.”\nMake sure everyone has their own safe space\nAll pets need to have a place they can go to feel safe or have some downtime. You can use baby gates or a crate to give your new pup a spot to decompress (and give your other dog a break from their new roommate). And cats should always have an area where they can escape to.\nMonitor interactions\nAs your dog is getting to know your other pets, and vice versa, you’ll want to keep an eye on their interactions. Praise them when they’re behaving appropriately, and intervene if you notice any growling or aggressive body language. To diffuse the situation, redirect your dog’s attention and then separate your pets for a bit. For the first three weeks, Peck advises against leaving your pets alone together. “When they’re around each other, make sure you’re actively watching them. And don’t leave them alone in the house together until you know they are really comfortable with each other.”\nBe patient\nWhen it comes to successfully integrating a new dog into your home, patience is a virtue. “The biggest mistake that I see pet parents make is trying to rush the process,” says Dr. Teran. “Helping pets learn to live together peacefully is a process. Sometimes it goes relatively quickly, and other times it takes longer. But don’t skip steps. Your patience will pay off in the long run.”",

Shutting off your dog’s warning system makes their behavior more unpredictable and, therefore, dangerous. (It’s like taking the batteries out of your smoke alarm instead of dealing with the fire.)\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nA better idea is to use a proactive training method called Behavior Adjustment Training (B.A.T.), which helps desensitize your dog to triggers (like an energetic puppy). If your dog gets frustrated,anxious, or fearful in social situations, it’s worth giving B.A.T. a shot. Here’s primer to help you get started.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nWhat is behavior adjustment training (B.A.T.)?\nWith B.A.T., you set up scenarios similar to situations that would cause a reaction from your dog but that are different enough that the dog can explore the area and learn about the trigger at their own pace. B.A.T. gives dogs a reality check. Dogs who would usually overreact have a chance to slow down and learn from experiences that contradict their negative expectations.\nHere’s how that reality check works. Your dog comes into a situation expecting XYZ to happen. That means they’re ready to respond in a certain way and interpret the situation through that lens. When XYZ doesn’t happen, it creates an “expectancy violation,” which can drastically change your dog’s outlook. Carefully orchestrated positive interactions can alter the way your dog responds to triggers. For example, my dog was terrified of strangers, and B.A.T. helped him learn that people were not scary, but fun. He now solicits attention and affection from people he’s never met.\nThe chance to fully explore a situation and learn about a trigger is one of the biggest differences between B.A.T. and other force-free techniques. Behavior exists to have an effect, and having effective behavioral strategies is one of the basic needs of all animals. Giving your dog control over stressors has a range of benefits, including better concentration and improved social skills, a healthier immune system, and resilience to stress.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for turning a stressful walk into a chill stroll.\nB.A.T. training set-ups are situations that a dog can manage without significant help. We can maximize empowerment by putting treats away and following the dog as they explore. Following your dog may contradict everything you’ve learned about training. You may have heard that you have to be a dominant leader, or that you and yourtreatshave to be the center of your dog’s universe. B.A.T. has a different approach, and it works.\nThe Three Components of B.A.T.\nB.A.T.’s emphasis is on empowerment — on teaching dogs that they can use behavior to control their own safety.\nYou’ll learn specific ways you can handle a long leash so your dog can move about freely and still be under control for safety. B.A.T. leash skills can be used with all dogs and puppies forsocializationand to reduce pulling. There are about 10 leash skills to practice, including ways to shorten the line without tangling it, stay out of your dog’s way, hold the leash so you can’t accidentally let go, get your dog’s attention with soft strokes on the leash, and gently bring your dog to a stop.\nWouldyouwant a stranger coming right up to your face?\nFor example, you can use the “slow stop” technique to keep your dog from getting too close to a trigger before they’re ready. To do a slow stop, gradually slow your walking and gently squeeze on the leash, letting some slide through. Think of it as gradually depressing a car’s brake pedal. If your dog suddenly slams to a stop, they’re more likely to overreact to the trigger than if they are slowly brought to a halt. After you stop your dog, relax the leash a little bit so they’re not restrained. (There are several more leash skills, each with a specific function.)\nThey’re not the main point of B.A.T., but they keep your dog from having a bad experience that may set back training. They’re what you use to get through situations that your dog can’t handle yet. For example, if you’re walking down the street with your dog (who often barks at children) and you see a child coming toward you, you could: cross the street, walk in an arc around the child, or cue your dog to look at you and/or feed treats as the two of you pass by. There are many ways to help your dog cope with trouble when they’re not ready to do it on their own.\nOne B.A.T. survival skill is called “mark and move,” where you use some sort of marker signal — say, aclicker— to pinpoint a behavior, like noticing the trigger, sniffing the trigger, blinking, or turning away. After marking, you encourage your dog to move away and then give them a reinforcer, such as a treat or a toy. Mark and move is basically just clicker training with movement, and is used for surprises on walks or when your dog first greets a trigger in the early stages of training.\nPro tips on training your dog with the click of a button — literally.\nMost people don’t want to use treats forever to keep their dog calm, and the good news is, you won’t have to. When you do enough of the training set-ups, your dog will start to handle more situations on their own. B.A.T. set-ups build a solid communication system with your dog so if they ever need your help, you’ll know.\nThese are safe scenarios where your dog can socialize naturally and interact with triggers in positive ways. I recommend doing your first sessions with a Certified B.A.T. Instructor or otherexperienced professional trainer. The example that follows will give you a taste of what B.A.T. looks like, but it’s better to know the full technique before using it.\nLet’s say your dog’s main issue is that he barks at children from 25 feet away. In a B.A.T. set-up with your friend’s child, your dog would ideally be wearing aharnessand be on a 15-foot leash. The child could sit at a picnic table with her mom at the far end of a park, say, 100 feet away from you. You and the other adult(s) have phones so you can communicate with one another during the exercise. If you think there’s any risk of your dog biting, have a barrier around the child or pre-train your dog to wear a muzzle.\nExperts pick the best harnesses for every kind of dog—from flat-faced breeds to tiny teacups to escape artists.\nFollow your dog casually as they walk around. At some point, your dog might notice the child and go back to sniffing. Simply follow, letting out the leash when needed, then catching up and shortening it again. Let your dog choose the route, resisting the temptation to lead your dog toward the child. To someone watching, it would look like your dog is looking for a place to pee, or maybe sniffing out squirrels — like a dog exploring the area, with an occasional interest in the child.\nAs your dog wanders, they may stay relaxed but gradually move closer to the child, which is great. If your dog starts to really focus on the child, perhaps by walking in a straight line toward her, do a slow stop and relax the leash. You could also walk at an angle that leads your dog away from the child and then stop, waiting for your dog to turn away. Keep the leash loose and don’t call your dog unless your dog is really having trouble. If you need to frequently redirect your dog, you may be too close, or the working environment may not encourage enough exploration. There are more details, but that’s the general idea.\nB.A.T. is kind of boring, actually, and that’s a good thing. Couldn’t you use a little less drama on your walks?",

    },
    "page_content": "If you’re a dog parent, and you’ve invested time and energy in training your pup, you’ll likely scoff at the idea that any cat could be smarter than your dog. But if you’re a cat parent, you’re definitely in the opposite camp. After all, cats are independent and won’t roll over for a treat — doesn’t that make them the far more intelligent species? If you have both catsanddogs, keep your opinion to yourself (and maybe sleep with one eye open in case either of them figures out your opinion).\nThe truth is that comparing the intelligence levels of dogs and cats is…complicated. Brian Hare, founder and director ofDuke University’s Canine Cognition Centerput it best in an interview withPBS NewsHour: “Asking which species is smarter is like asking if a hammer is a better tool than a screwdriver. Each tool is designed for a specific problem, so of course it depends on the problem we are trying to solve.”\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nWhile there is no single test to determine whether dogs are smarter than cats (or vice versa), there are multiple ways that scientists and researchers measure intelligence in animal species. Kinship explores the factors that can help determine intelligence in our favorite pets and (hopefully) finally put to rest the question: Are cats more intelligent than dogs?\nCats are generally considered smarter than dogs, just because of their more independent nature and ability to solve problems on their own. But dogs are known as more trainable, able to learn a wide variety of tricks, and even perform jobs like search and rescue.\nThis study found that cranky pups are actually very fast social learners.\nWhile there are an abundance of studies on dog intelligence and behavior, there are far fewer on cats and none comparing the two species. Behavioral studies usually ask animals to perform tasks or solve puzzles, which dogs are more than happy to do, but cats may be less willing to participate in. That said, research has been divided on the dog/cat intelligence question, withsome studiessuggesting dogs are more intelligent than cats because of their social nature, while others found that cats rank higher in abilities, such aslong-term memory.\n“Cats display a lot of individual variation and have distinct personalities, which makes it hard for researchers to understand them,” Kristyn Vitale Shreve, cat cognition and behavior research fellow at Oregon State Universitytold PBS.\nComparing animal intelligence is challenging because intelligence is hard to define, and different species have different types of intelligence. For example, a bird may be fantastic at navigating large distances but unable to solve a basic puzzle.\nSo, what does intelligence mean for dogs and cats? Can we compare cat IQ vs dog IQ? Not exactly. There’s cognitive intelligence, which includes problem-solving, memory, and emotional intelligence, but there is also practical intelligence, which refers to an animal’s ability to survive and thrive in the wild. In this regard, cats are better hunters than dogs, but dogs are more emotionally intelligent, having adapted over time to understand humans.\nIs your dog the ultimate smarty pants?\nBecause there are so many different facets of intelligence,comparing two different speciesisn’t exactly fair. Both dogs and cats are intelligent in their own ways, based on centuries of evolution as well as the unique environments of individual animals.\nWhat factors determine intelligence in cats and dogs?\nThe intelligence of cats and dogs can be measured in a variety of ways, from the size and function of their brains to their cognitive and emotional intelligence. We’ll dive into several of these factors, but keep in mind that the differences between dogs and cats are a result of their interactions with humans, selective breeding, and the environments that each species has experienced.\nResearchers often measure intelligence by examining the cerebral cortex of the brain, which is the area responsible for many cognitive abilities, including memory and problem-solving. A dog’s brain is not onlylarger than a cat’s, but it also has a greater area devoted to the cerebral cortex. In canines, this part of the brain plays a major role in social intelligence and communication.\nWhile a cat’s brain is smaller, their cerebral cortex is associated with vision and movement, which can be tied back to their stealth and hunting skills. Cat brains also have a more highly developed hippocampus, the part of the brain that handles spatial memory and navigation.\nNeurologist Suzana Herculano-Houzel has spent over 15 years analyzing cognitive functions in the brains of both humans and animals, including comparing the cat brain vs. the dog brain. In one experiment, she counted up the neurons in the cortexes of a cat, a mixed-breed small dog, and a Golden Retriever. Neurons are the cells responsible for transmitting information in the brain, and per Dr. Herculano-Houzel, “The more [neurons] you find in the brain, the more cognitively capable the animal is.”\nAccording to animal behaviorist Karen London, using a more specific terms like“biddable”or“bombproof” can help you better understand your dog.\nIn her research, Dr. Herculano-Houzel found429 million neuronsin the mixed breed dog and 623 million neurons in the Golden Retriever, while cats had only 250 million. While these numbers can’t provide a definitive answer in the great cats vs. dogs intelligence debate, they do suggest that dogs have a higher cognitive capacity than cats.\nDogs are known for their trainability, which is why they’ve been known as man’s best friend for centuries. Whether trained simply to sit, stay, and come, or to do more complex tasks as a working dog, canines tend to have the upper hand (paw?) when it comes to training.\nHowever, just because cats can be more challenging to train doesn’t mean that they can’t be trained at all. In fact, cats actually respond well to clicker training and have the ability to learn many of the same tricks as dogs. Some cat breeds are even known foracting more like dogs, both in their social nature and trainability. So, are cats smarter than dogs? The simple answer is that they’re just different with unique skills.\nCats tend to show more problem-solving skills thanmany other speciesand have even been known to continue working on a puzzle after a dog has given up or asked for human assistance. Felines are even known to use tools to solve problems, such as opening doors or even manipulating levers to get food.\nDogs have the ability to understand much more complex things than you give them credit for.\nWhile dogs also possess problem-solving abilities, cats tend to be quicker at working out solutions, which anyone who has found their cat in the kitchen cabinets can attest to and may use as proof cats are smarter than dogs.\nDogs tend to be highly socially intelligent, understanding and communicating with other dogs and humans. Studies show that dogs can learn and respond toan average of 165 wordsand phrases, with some dogs learning as many as 250. Dogs have a pack mentality and develop strong bonds with their human families, which can be another sign of their social intelligence. In fact, most dogs have the language skills andintelligence of a human two-year-old.\nWhile cats are hardly known for their sociability, they are capable ofunderstanding and respondingto humans (they just may choose not to). Cats are smarter when it comes to learning from observation, which is known as social learning and is a sign of advanced intelligence.\nWhat is the evidence that claims cats are smarter than dogs?\nWhile there is no definite evidence to back up the claim that cats are smarter than dogs, the idea can mostly be traced back to general perceptions of the two species. Cats are often seen as independent, while dogs are considered more social. But is a cat smarter than a dog?\nDogs have been domesticated far longer than cats, which could explain theirstronger bonds with humansand high level of emotional intelligence. While cats are capable of reading human emotion, dogssense the moodsof their human parents more easily.\nThis popular training technique isn’t just for dogs. Here’s how you can use it for your cat.\nDogs may be known for their trainability, but cats are capable of learning tricks as well. It just may take a little more time and patience to teach your cat tasks that may come more quickly to a dog.\nBoth cats and dogs can learn through observing other animals and humans, but they have different skill sets. Cats tend to be better at stealth and hunting, while dogs rank higher in social intelligence and understanding humans. You can eventest your dog’s intelligenceat home with fun games and puzzle challenges.\nAre there specific breeds known for their intelligence?\nBorder Collies are often considered the smartest dog breed, closely followed by Poodles, German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, and Doberman Pinschers. Among cats, the Bengal, Abyssinian, and Siamese breeds are known for their high intelligence as well as their ability to learn and perform tricks.\nSo, are dogs or cats smarter? There is no clear answer to the question of whether cats or dogs are smarter. Both species are intelligent in their own unique ways, thanks to centuries of evolution. The best way to determine which animal is smarter is to consider the specific criteria you are using to measure intelligence or, better yet, accept that there is no right answer and move on because, well, it doesn’t really matter. Regardless, your cat or dog deserves your love and attention, so maybe try some challenging toys and puzzles to stimulate their intellectual abilities.\nGenius takes many forms. Could your cat be one?\nFAQ\nCats are known for their aloof personalities and mysterious natures, which often gives the impression that they’re more intelligent. But both cats and dogs have high levels of intelligence in different ways. For example, cats are often better problem-solvers, while dogs excel at social intelligence.\nHow smart are cats? While there is no definite way to measure intelligence in cats or dogs, some factors to consider are each species’ brain size, their ability to solve problems, their social intelligence, and how trainable they are.\nContrary to popular belief, catscan be trained— it just takes a little more effort and patience. Start by setting up a reward system and make sure to choose a treat or reward that your cat really loves. Begin with small tricks, like sit, and take things slow. You may also want to try clicker training, which often works well with cats.\nDogs tend to be easier to train than cats because they have a desire to perform well and make their human parents or trainers happy. So, are dogs smarter? The truth is that cats can be trained as well, by choosing the right rewards and committing to a training regimen.\nLet the games begin.\nCats actually tend to be stronger problem-solvers than dogs because of their independent nature. Many cats will continue working out a puzzle even when a dog has stopped.\nBorder Collies, Poodles, German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, and Doberman Pinschers have long been considered the top five smartest dog breeds. Some of the most intelligent cat breeds are the Bengal, Abyssinian, and Siamese.\nReferences\nWhich are smarter, cats or dogs? We asked a scientist\nWhich are smarter, cats or dogs?

    "page_content": "There’s a lot of information floating around the Internet about what games you play with your dog that make them quietly go insane. Rest assured, there’s one game you can still play with your pup that will only makeyouinsane — tug!\nCanine behavior experts have given the game theirseal of approval, though there are caveats. Dogs who like it — which is most of them — get a lot from it; even some who don’t take to it immediately can learn to enjoy it. One of the beautiful things about this game is that for most dogs, nobody has to teach them how to do it. Even puppies still adorably tripping over their own feet play tug games. It’s that natural for them.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nBut it’s uncommon to meet dogs with a casual interest in the game — dogs tend to eitherloveto play tug or have little interest in it all. Here are the ins and outs of the game for new pet parents or for seasoned pet parents who have never known there was anything more to know than “pull.”\nWhy Do Dogs Like Tug of War?\nFor the ones who adore it, tug offers a way to engage them in play,exercisethem, teach them skills they need to play safely so it’s fun for people and dogs alike, and reinforce them with something valuable.\nAnd for a game you can play in a relatively small space, it’s remarkably tiring for your dog. The high-intensity nature of tug relaxes a lot of dogs, improving their emotional state and leaving them calm and contented after a good session.\nYou can play tug with dogsindoors— great news when it’s stifling hot,pouring rainor too cold to enjoy being outside for long. Playing outdoors is wonderful, too, but it’s nice to have an indoor option. Tug is an easy game, it requires no great skill to play. Simplicity is always a gift, and tug offers it.\nHow to Play Tug-of-War With Your Dog\nThough training isn’t necessary for most dogs to enjoy this natural andfun game, some need a little encouragement to join in. Some timid dogs show a bit of hesitancy about pulling on an object when a person picks it up or has it in hand. To get such dogs fully on board with tug, it helps to signal to your dog that you want to play.\nOffer a modifiedplay bowby bending your knees and leaning over at the waist, then wave a long toy on the ground to get their attention. For dogs who aren’t naturals at tug, putting a toy on the ground and then moving it around or waving it back and forth will get the game going. Many dogs who are tug converts learned to play it this way.\nIt doesn’t have to be a battle.\nCalmly praise them for approaching the toy and for taking hold of it. Keep that gentle praise coming as they grab the toy, then pull back gently. For a dog who’s a bit unsure, it’s important that you refrain from pulling hard or waving the toy frantically. Keep things nice and easy. Be chill.\nIf your dog will grab the toy but won’t pull on it, use only the tiniest bit of pressure when you pull the toy to make it more likely that they will hang on to it. Once they’re regularly and reliably holding on, gradually increase the force you use to pull. Before long, they’re likely to match your effort. And voilà — a game of tug will be in session.\nWhat about tug-of-war with a teething puppy?\nTug can be fun, but playing with a dog who gradually moves their mouth up the tug toy toward your hand can suck the joy out of the game really fast. Safety is always the primary goal, so if your dog is a creeper, it’s a good idea to make some adjustments to protect your delicate human hand from the teeth and powerful jaws of yourdog’s mouth.\nThere are two ways to do this. One is to use a really long toy, which requires your dog to move quite a way up the toy before the situation becomes troublesome. A second is to grab the end of the toy they originally had and reset the game; in this case, you’ll be holding the end opposite from where you started.\nHow do you do this? As they approach your end of the toy, drop it and reach for the end of their side. This takes coordination, speed and practice, but quickly becomes quite natural. There may be a few collisions during the learning process, so be careful.\nIf neither of those methods are enough to manage the issue, entice them with a second tug toy, then switch between the two as needed. Or, finally, end the game when their mouth starts to travel along the toy toward you. Many dogs are more likely to stick to their end of the toy once they figure out that doing otherwise hastens the end of the game.\nIs Tug of War Bad for Dogs?\nYears ago, playing tug was not considered a great idea with dogs. There were concerns about allowing the dogs to use the full force of their mouths around people’s hands and about tug leading toover-arousal. Many also feared that allowing dogs to “win” by ending up with the toy would lead to trouble in the form of dogs throwing their weight around because they had succeeded in tug. Knowledge and beliefs are constantly changing, and now, the benefits of tug are more universally recognized.\nChase? Wrestle? Tug-o-war? Find out which are fair game.\nHowever,research by Rooney and Bradshawreported in 2002 suggests that allowing a certain type of dog to keep the toy after a game of tug can create a different issue. In their study, they observed that the mostplayful dogsbecame pushier for attention from their owners if they were allowed to keep the toy after tug games.\nThis is easy to avoid. If your dog is really persistent and likely to pester you to play, simply put the toy out of reach when the tug game is over.\nSome dogs never tire of tug and are willing to play until their person is ready to stop. Other dogs lose interest quickly even though their people want to keep playing. If your dog is one of the latter, making the game more exciting will help keep them interested.\nHow to Make Playing Tug More Interesting For Your Dog\nUse the toy your dog is most interested in. For many dogs, the top-level toy is a really thick rope, two inches or so in diameter and at least two feet long, sometimes with a knot tied in each end to make it more grippable.\nPlay at the time of day during which your dog is the most energetic. For a lot of dogs, the best time to play tug is mid-morning or late afternoon, times when a majority of dogs are filled with energy and likely to be the most playful. If you’re not sure when your dog is most revved up, experiment with play at different times of day to figure out if it makes a difference in how long her interest lasts.\nSome dogs find it more exciting to play tug if you pull the toy in a haphazard fashion rather than smoothly, and/or if you pull upward rather than straight and parallel to the ground. To keep from injuring either yourself or your dog, avoid pulling too jerkily or too high.\nIf your dog also enjoysfetch, combine tug with a retrieve. Throw the toy, and when your dog brings it back, reinforce with a game of tug. Don’t tug too long, though; before they lose interest, throw the toy again. Vary the fetch/tug ratio: Go from 1:1 to 1:3 or 1:4. Unpredictably mixing the two games keeps many dogs interested and willing to play longer.\nCan a Dog Be Trained to Like Tug\nIf calmly pulling a toy along the ground doesn’t work, there’s another way to help a dog find their tug groove: Teach it as you would teach any other trick — such as “shake,” “roll over “or “wave good-bye” — through shaping, which is reinforcing successive approximations of the behavior you want to eventually achieve.\nWith tug, that means begin byreinforcingyour dog for showing any interest in the toy, whether looking at it, approaching it, or poking at it with their paw or nose. Over time, raise your criteria so your dog has to do more to earn the treats. The series of steps may be touching the toy, remaining in physical contact with it a beat longer, mouthing it and grabbing it.\nIt actually has a lot to do with genetics.\nEventually, offer your dog treats for pulling on the toy while you hold the other end, gradually requiring them to pull harder or longer to earn the reinforcement. Some dogs will only ever play tug in this kind of mechanical way, but others come to love it and begin to play the game just for the fun of it.\nHow to Keep a Dog From Becoming Overexcited Playing Tug\nThough it takes effort to get some dogs get excited enough about tug to play, there are also dogs on the opposite end of the spectrum, ones who struggle with emotional control during tug. These dogs can get nippy, leap up on people or even pull them over. Such out-of-control behavior is generally all about arousal, and that must be addressed in order for tug to be fun for both of you.\nDogs need to develop and practice self-control to be able to play appropriately, and it’s easier for them to do that if we work on lowering their arousal level. Generally, the best advice is not to add to the arousal, and to do everything you can to control it.\nChoose the tug toy carefully. Use one that doesn’t get the dog too revved up. Choose the time of day. Many dogs are naturally calmest in the middle of the day or after a long walk or run, and those might be the best times to play tug with a dog who is easily amped up during the game.\nTake frequent breaks of 5 to 15 seconds to interrupt the upward spiral of enthusiasm. When you play, pull the toy in a slow, steady way, low and parallel to the ground rather than upward in a jerky or unpredictable way.\nHow to Help a Dog Accept the End of the Game\nSome dogs aretooenthusiastic about tug, and don’t take it well when the game ends. One of the best ways to handle this is to teach your dog that when you say “all done,” you will only tug for a few seconds more.\nCommunicating intent to end the game helps many dogs cope because they are not caught off guard. It’s tough for dogs who want to play tug endlessly to have it end without any warning.\nAnother way to ease the pain of ending the game is to follow it with something else your dog likes — atraining session, awalk, amassage— so that they associate the end of a tug game with feeling happy.\nHere’s the takeaway: Tug is fun and makes many dogs so happy. Let the games begin!",

      "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/head-haltis-for-training"
    },
    "page_content": "If you’re like me and have enjoyed the unique pleasure of attempting to walk a leash-reactive dog, you know how frustrating a process it can be. When a pup is prone to pulling, it can really take the joy out of a casual stroll for all involved. With that in mind, you’ve probably conducted a lot of personal research looking for solutions by way of Google. While exhaustingly browsing, there is one common option that no doubt popped up early and often — the head halti. Unfortunately, there is also a bit of confusion surrounding how best to use this tool and its potential repercussions. Some experts claim it is the key to a peaceful walk, while others warn it can create more problems when employed incorrectly.\nThe 411 on Head Haltis\nAlso known as a “gentle leader” or “head halter,” the head halti features a collar that wraps around the dog’s muzzle before looping around their neck and connecting to a leash. It’s a simple design that can seem much preferable to the other solutions you might find on Amazon.“They are a popular choice because they usually look less aversive than prong collars and they are quick to help someone walk their hard-pulling dog,” says Charlie DiBono, trainer and founder ofBody and Mind K9in Long Beach, California. He fears that while these leashes can help cease pulling in the short term, over time this welcomed result will fade as the negative consequences remain and only intensify.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nDog trainer Karen B. London promises you’re not doomed to be pulled down the street forever.\n“As trainers, we try to help our clients feel confident walking their dogs. This tool allows people to feel that quickly, however, the risks are not worth the reward, especially with so many other options for tools with lower risks,” DiBono says, adding that he has never recommended the head halti to pet parents. “Personally, I feel that they are extremely dangerous and harmful to a dog,” he adds.\nIt’s a controversial take, given that the leash is widely used by many dog-training professionals to help battle pulling and reactivity. For instance, president and co-founder of Synergy Veterinary BehaviorDr. Valli Parthasarathybelieves that head halters can be extremely useful when used correctly. “I do think that they can be really effective. But we also have to be selective with, what patients we use them with and we certainly don’t use them for all patients,” she says. Dr. Parthasarathy adds that these leashes provide more physical control over dogs than a standard neck collar or harness. The key, however, is ensuring the dog is comfortable and conditioned to wearing the head halter properly.\nSome Things to Keep in Mind About Head Haltis\nHead haltis take much of their inspiration from that of a horse’s collar, and structurally they are nearly identical. DiBono believes therein lies the problem. “Dogs’ necks are not built like a horse’s and can easily be damaged by an owner pulling too hard in one direction,” he says. On top of being substantially smaller than horses, a dog’s neck is obviously shorter and far less muscular. So, if their neck is being pulled too hard in one direction, it could easily be injured. Beyond that, the muzzle is a much more sensitive region for dogs than horses.\nDon’t let your new dogwalk you.\nDiBono explains that dogs have a massive amount of sensitive nerves running through their noses. As a result, they have nerve pathways close to the surface that can be delicate and easily impaired when too much pressure is put on the surrounding area. He fears that this can cause serious damage to a dog’s famously powerful sense of smell. This is a potential injury that would have wide-ranging implications, as dogs use their olfactory abilities to gather critical information about their environment, navigate their surroundings, and as a means of recognizing their people.\n“Through these nerves that lead from their nose to their eyes, dogs can literally see things that they smell,” DiBono says. We should not be placing any pressure in such a sensitive location and applying force to their heads causing trauma to their neck.” He worries that beyond nerve and nose damage, neck and spine injuries are also risks involved with the force applied from a head halti.\nIf You Use a Head Halti, Take These Precautions\nDr. Parthasarathy clarifies that while there hasn’t been significant research into these potential damages, she has witnessed adverse reactions in dogs using head halters — albeit with less severe consequences. Generally, it results from pet parents not having properly introduced the tool and allowing pups to become comfortable with it.\n“I have seen dogs that have will scratch the ground, rub their face on the ground, or scratch out their faces with their paws so that they really abrade the area or start bleeding,” she explains. Additionally, she notes that the risk of neck injury is fairly low. That being said, if a dog has a pre-existing neck injury, Dr. Parthasarathy would advise against the use of a gentle leader.\nWouldyouwant a stranger coming right up to your face?\nNow, none of this means you have to resign yourself to a life of sore wrists and blistered hands. There are safe and successful solutions to tempering leash reactivity with or without head halters. Dr. Parthasarathy says that above all, it’s imperative to afford pups the proper time and training to acclimate to these tools before taking them out for a stroll in public.\n“We can minimize the chances of any sort of negative consequence of these leashes by doing training in situations where the dog can wear the halter and learn behaviors without external stimuli that might trigger them,” she says. Dr. Parthasarathy advises allowing dogs to smell the leash before giving them a treat to create a positive association. Then you can gradually work up to putting it on and walking around your home and eventually outside once they’re comfortable. Fit is equally crucial. Dr. Parthasarathy states that this tool should not be mistaken for a muzzle and not be too tight over the mouth. “The head halter is more of a seatbelt. It’s ideally not the primary way that we’re controlling the dog,” she explains.\nAnother Option to Try\nIf you want an alternative to head haltis altogether, DiBono recommends a well-fit slip. These leashes slide right over a dog’s head to rest comfortably on their neck. However, what is most effective is teaming with a trainer to help resolve any pulling or leash reactivity. Both Dr. Parthasarathy and DiBono agree that the safest means of attacking these problems is with a professional who can guide both you and your pet toward a more enjoyable walking situation. This will also minimize any user errors or possible injuries from misuse and hopefully end at a place where assistance is no longer necessary.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for turning a stressful walk into a chill stroll.\n“Your biggest asset is a well-educated trainer. Ask them to show you how to properly fit, condition, use, and phase out tools. There should always be the goal of not using the tool anymore as they are just training aids,” DiBono says.",

      "title": "How to Prepare Your Dog for Your New Baby",
      "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/preparing-dog-for-baby"
    },
    "page_content": "Yay, a baby (a human one this time!) is going to enter your home, your heart, and yourlives. I love being a parent, so I am thrilled for you. As a mom, I welcome anyone starting the journey into parenthood with joy and warmest wishes, but with only one piece of advice: Enjoy your child at whatever stage they are in.\nAs a dog trainer and behaviorist, it’s a different story because I have all kinds of advice, starting with this: Begin preparing your dognowfor this biggest and most wonderful of life changes. Change is hard, and the less your dog associates the changes with the new baby, the easier the transition will be. That’s why you should start right now; it doesn’t matter if you just tossed the positive pregnancy test in the trash a minute ago, you are a couple of months from your due date, you have just found out you will be adopting or fostering an infant, or the baby is about to be born. Do whatever you can with whatever time remains before the baby’s arrival, and the early effort will pay dividends.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nGet your dog used to new equipment and the new set-up of the house now.\nThe more you can make changes ahead of the baby’s arrival, the smoother the transition will be for you and your dog. If the baby gear shows up months ahead of time, your dog will already be used to it when the baby arrives. It’s better to adjust to the swing, the crib, the bouncy seat, the car seat in the carandat home, etc., now rather than overwhelming your dog with adjusting to those things and the baby at the same time. Allow your dog to sniff these items when you bring them home and after they are in place (as long as they are in a room your dog will be allowed in) to help the dog accept them.\nThey’ll always remember their first childhood pet—this intro is just the beginning.\nMove any furniture that will be part of the rearranging-for-baby plan now. Changing things around in the house can make dogs feel a touch on edge, and it’s better to avoid doing that at the same time as the big changes that naturally happen when the baby arrives. Help your dog by putting up any baby gates you plan to use right now, and by walking your dog while also pushing a stroller. Any change you can make now instead of later is a way of being kind to your dog so they aren’t hit with all the changes all at once.\nChange routines now.\nJust as you don’t want your dog to associate the baby with all the physical changes and new items, the same goes for changes in routine. Make as many of them as you can ahead of time so the baby’s arrival is less of a shock for your dog.\nIf you dog will be taken out by a dog walker orattend daycareafter the baby comes, have your dog experience some of those walking sessions or daycare days now. The expense of these services can be an issue, so you don’t have to schedule them as frequently now as you plan to after the baby comes. Just make sure you have enough dog walker or daycare sessions ahead of the baby’s arrival so that your pup is accustomed to them.\nIs your dog showing empathy? Or just plain annoyance?\nFollow your new schedule now as much as possible. If your dog will not always have that long walk first thing in the morning once your baby enters the picture, start mixing it up. Continue to walk your dog a lot, but vary when you go so your dog is more accepting of variations in schedule ahead of the big permanent shift. Creating some unpredictability in routine is a great way to prepare your dog ahead of time for the adjustments of a new baby, so add in some small variations to when you feed your dog, and when you play, too.\nNew sounds and smells should predict treats.\nSome of what stresses dogs out about new babies involves new sounds and new smells. For example, to avoid the upsetting experience of a baby crying, which usually means the dog will be ignored, teach your dog ahead of time to handle this sound. You can use professional sounds of a crying baby or just record a friend’s baby and then play the sound for your dog. Don’t just play the tape and expect your dog to get used to it. Instead, actively teach your dog that crying predicts delicious treats. Offer your dog something wonderful — treats, or a stuffed food toy, or something great to chew — when the crying starts. Start with the volume very low and only play if for a few seconds.\nGradually, increase the volume until even loud crying is greeted with the wagging tail of a dog who expects a great treat. Then, slowly start increasing the length of time the crying lasts, allowing your dog to enjoy their treat while the crying continues. Once your baby arrives, keep offering great treats when the baby cries so your dog is not upset by the sound or by your attention going to the baby.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nSimilarly, teach your dog that the smells of baby wipes, diapers, and other baby products meantreats are coming. It’s hard to mimic the real smells of a baby, but if your dog is used to getting treats when you’re at the changing table, it’s easier to teach your dog to accept the actual experience of a diaper change for the baby and all the real smells associated with it. Use treats in this context beforeandafter baby’s arrival (put a jar of treats near the changing table) to help your dog.\nStart teaching new rules now.\nIf your dog will be sleeping in a different location after the baby joins the family, make that change now. If that means your dog will no longer be allowed on the bed or will be on a dog bed in a new spot, it’s a kindness to get your dog used to the new place as soon as you can, and certainly before the baby comes. Anything you can do to avoid having the dog feel like the baby displaced them or took their place will make the transition an easier and a happier one.\nSimilarly, if there will be new rules about being on the furniture or if the dog will no longer be allowed in the baby’s room, start teaching those new boundaries now. Many dogs are expected to ride in a new location in the car after there is a baby on board, so that is another pattern to let your dog know about now, rather than the first time they get in the car with the baby.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nPlan ahead for ways for your dog to amuse themselves or get attention.\nIt’s really hard to give your dog as much attention after the baby arrives as you did before, and that’s OK — really it is. It’s unbelievably time-consuming and overwhelming to care for a baby, and I know I couldn’t walk, train, or play with my dog as much in those first few months. Luckily, when I had my kids, some of my dog-training friends helped me out with extra walks, training, and play sessions, and I had a plan in place to help him enjoy that period of his life anyway. You should have a plan, too, for your dog’s sake, and so you don’t feel guilty.\nAsk ahead of time for helpful friends to walk your dog or to give them extra attention when visiting. Many people want to help out a family with a new baby, but not everyone is adept at delivering meals or cleaning the house. Some of us are best able to help by walking dogs or playing fetch in the yard. Round up the helpful people in your life and ask them ahead of time if they can do this.\nBuy lots of treats, toys, and items to chew on so you are ready to offer your dog an activity that does not interfere with baby duties. Food toys to stuff, antlers, Nylabones,Greenies, and cow hooves are all helpful, as are many other things that keep dogs busy. Check with your veterinarian about which items they recommend and which should be avoided, but have a lot of them on hand before the baby arrives.\nIf your pup acts diabolical on walks, you are not alone. Here’s what you can do.\nTeach specific training skills ahead of time.\nIt’s super useful in any situation to be able to communicate to your dog what you would like them to do, and that’s especially true when a new baby is on the scene. The more training your dog has, the easier it will be to live happily together as a parent to dogs and kids. Think carefully about what you will want your dog to be able to do at that time, and start training your dog now to be good at those skills. Here are my top picks for skills worth teaching dogs when a baby will be joining the family soon.\nBeing able to send your dog to their “place” (this could be a mat, a bed, a crate or a laundry room) is really helpful. I used this cue when one of my sons spit up, and I didn’t want my dog’s help cleaning it up (ugh). I also used it when I wanted to put them on the floor for a second to attend to something in the kitchen while I couldn’t keep my eye on things. It’s also useful when guests come over if they want to see the baby, but are not so into the dog.\nIf your dog jumps up on you when you come home or enter the room, teach your dog a more polite greeting that involves staying on the ground. It’s not safe to have a dog jumping on you when you are holding a baby, and it can be scary for everyone. This applies not just to big dogs, but also to little dogs, who can still cause tripping and balance issues.\nDog trainer Karen B. London promises you’re not doomed to be pulled down the street forever.\nIt’s harder to get our dogs out for walks when we are taking care of a new baby, and it’s especially challenging if they pull on the leash, run in front of us constantly so we are at risk of colliding with them, or wrap themselves around trees and posts while on leash. Dogs who do these things are less likely to get to go on walks after the baby arrives, so do everyone a favor and work on those leash manners now. Dogs who walk nicely on leash are welcomed more often to outings that involve carrying the baby or pushing them in a stroller, so good leash manners are an important skill related to a good quality of life.\nPreparing your dog for the new baby can be summarized in two words: “Start now.” Nobody is ever able to fully prepare a dog (or themselves for that matter!) for the arrival of a new baby, but starting now is the best plan for getting the whole family as ready as possible. Do as much as you can ahead of time. Your future self will thank you, and your dog’s life will be better.",

      "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/dog-wont-come-when-called"
    },
    "page_content": "Does your dog reliably come in response to a signal like the whirl of a can opener, the sound of a treat drawer or jar being opened, or the word “walk”? When your dog hears cues that promise something they like, they come running — every time and with great enthusiasm. Yet, one of the most common behavioral frustrations that pet parents have is that their dogs won’tcome when called.\nThere is a lot to be revealed about dog behavior by situations in which you may have accidentally trained your dogs to have a good recall (meaning they come back to you). If you feel like you’re failing in your efforts — there’s a silver lining here: you can use lessons from these accidental recalls to get your dog to come when you want them to.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nDoes Your Dog Run Away From You?\nPart of the issue is that all too many people expect their dogs to come when called without having trained them to do so. In fact, when people say, “My dog runs away and won't come when called,” the first question I ask is, “Have you trained them to do that?”\nKinshipCollective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a stubborn pup to listen up.\nThe fact is, dogs don’t come into this world ready to respond to the word “come” by trotting to you, much less to do it joyfully or to do it every time. It takes a lot of repetition for dogs to learn what thecuemeans and to respond to it as we would like them to. It’s unreasonable to assume that your dog will run to you when you call them — simply because they are a dog, and you are a person, and that’s what you want them to do.\nDogs tend to do things that make them happy. That approach to life — seeking joy — is something we love about them, and it makes sense to take advantage of it in training. Teaching a dog to come to you rather than run away involves developing a strong association between your signal and something good happening for the dog. If your dog learns that coming to you in response to a specific cue leads to good things for them, then they’ll want to come, and will do so consistently.\nFor example, once your dog figures out that every time you pick up the leash, they go for a walk, they will naturally approach you when you pick up the leash. Similarly, if they learn that the crinkling of a treat bag is a sure sign that treats are in their future, it should come as no surprise that this sound prompts them to run to you as fast as their legs can carry them. The key is that you’re doing something that your dog can rely on to result in a positive experience.\nTikTok pet parents have made this clear: Tone matters. Celebrity dog trainer Nicole Ellis says dogs can hear “stress in our voice — whether directed at them or when they hear us talking to others.”\nThis is a lesson that can be carried over from accidental to purposeful (re)training: make sure that something good happens every single time your dog responds appropriately to the cue.\nNegative Associations That Push Your Dog Away\nSometimes, what you “reward” your dog with when they come falls intonegativeterritory. When you don’t have a treat because you forgot or didn’t feel like going to get one, you skip that step and give the dog a less-than-thrilling “Good girl, good girl, good girl,” along with apat on the head, something most dogs generally dislike.\nOr, they may use a treat that the dog isn’t very excited about — regular dog kibble or a dry biscuit instead of something meaty and smelly and really tasty. (By way of analogy, most of us respond differently to spinach, dry crackers, and brownies. I do like spinach and crackers, but of the three, only a brownie is wonderful enough to elevate my mood.)\nBaby talk works on puppies. As for adult dogs, that’s still up for debate.\nIt’s not unusual for a dog to respond beautifully to being called, only to find that they have left the fun of the yard for the boredom of the house, where they’ll perhaps be alone for hours. People also call their dogs to come for things many dogs consider horrible, such as a bath or a nail trim.\nIn these cases, “Come!” serves as a warning. (“Thanks for the heads up — I’ll stay away so I don’t have to stop playing and I can avoid whatever misery you have in mind.”) The result is that the dog is not nearly as willing or interested in coming as she would be if her people had trained the response to this cue properly, as so many have done accidentally.\n(Re)training Your Dog to Respond\nIn addition to starting over by training an intentional recall just as you trained the accidental one, you can also transfer the cue. “Transferring a cue” is a technical expression in dog training that means teaching your dog to respond to a new cue by pairing it with one they already know. So, if they always come to you when they hear the sound of a treat bag being opened, you simply say “Come” every time you’re about to open the treat bag, then reinforce them with atreatwhen they comply.\nSoon, with enough repetitions, your dog will learn that the cue predicts the sound of the treat bag, which predicts treats. Before long, “come” will predict treats in their mind just as the sound of the treat bag does. Then, you can call them to come and reinforce them for doing so without the opening-the-treat-bag sound. The cue has been transferred.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s pro tips for walking a pup that wantsto chase everything that moves.\nMany recalls are trained without thought, yet they are very effective because the training process followed the rules for teaching a perfect recall. Just because a perfect recall does not happen to be in response to saying, “Come!” doesn’t mean that a dog has not learned this most prized and valuable behavior. Accidental recalls are still recalls. Use them to your advantage.\nHere are the key points to keep in mind when training your dog to reliably return to you on cue.\nMake recall training a priority.\nMake recall training a priority.\nFigure out what makes your dog want to come to you.\nFigure out what makes your dog want to come to you.\nConsistently pair up the recall cue with your dog’s favorite things, aiming for 100 percent association between the word “come” (or whatever word you use) and something good.\nConsistently pair up the recall cue with your dog’s favorite things, aiming for 100 percent association between the word “come” (or whatever word you use) and something good.\nReinforce with a top-quality item.

    "page_content": "The expression “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks,” has done enough damage to dogs and people and the relationship they share, so let’s set the record straight: Youcanteach old dogs new tricks, and youshouldteach old dogs new tricks. Not only that, it’s fun to teach old dogs new tricks, and it’s a great kindness to your old dog to do so. If you are looking to train an older dog, these tips for beginners will get you started, and from there, there are no limits to what you and your dog can do together.\nUnderstand Behavior Changes in Your Senior Dog\nAs dogs get older, their behavior does change, though their general personality and temperament aren’t going to be radically different just because they have celebrated a few more birthdays. Some common behavior changes in older dogs can affect their training, though not every one of them is relevant for each individual dog.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nAs dogs age, it’s important to recognize both physical and mental changes they may be experiencing.\nOlder dogs slow down as they age, just like people do, so that’s another entry into the “we’re not so different after all” category. Slowing down affects the training of older dogs because they have less energy, so they may not be able to practice coming when called too many times at once or perform other intense behaviors in rapid succession. Dogs who slow down also have a decreased appetite, so it’s best to do training sessions ahead of meals, when they are most hungry and will respond to treats.\nLots of older dogs develop fears of loud sounds even if they were not sound sensitive when they were younger. One reason this may happen is because when older dogs startle in response to a loud noise, the sudden movement can cause them pain. (So relatable!) They learn to associate the pain with the loud sound and then become scared of such noises. Training places where loud sounds are unlikely to interrupt the training will prevent older dogs from developing any negative associations with the training.\nWhat are the best ways to manage a dog’s pain?\nCommon Issues with Senior Dogs\nThere are common issues in senior dogs that we must consider when training adult dogs who are heading into or already in their golden years. Their senses may not be as good, so it might be harder for them to see and hear you. Use very clear visual signals and perhaps louder vocal ones to help your dog get the message.\nPainor soreness in senior dogs may influence how quickly they respond to cues or whether they respond at all. When choosing what behaviors you want to teach an older dog, eliminate those that may cause discomfort. That means no jumping through hoops or up onto high surfaces and no dancing on their back legs. Keep in mind they may struggle to look up at you at a sharp angle or even to lie down frequently. Teaching them to go to their bed, to lift a paw, or to place their head on your lap may be easier for them.\nSpice Girlsreference aside, just because your dog is graying around the eyes doesn’t mean those eyes don’t light up at playtime.\nAll dogs may have reasons for not performing the behavior you ask them to, but that’s especially true of senior dogs. Not responding is sometimes considered disobedience, but it’s far kinder to try to understandwhythey didn’t do what you wanted. In the context of modern dog training, it’s best to evaluate whether they are confused, haven’t really learned the skill yet, or feel too much discomfort to do it. Or, in general terms, consider that the dog is notgivingyou a hard time, the dog ishavinga hard time.\nDifferent Types of Training to Consider\nAlthough training dogs of all ages follows the same principles, there are some tips for older dogs specifically that make the process easier and more effective. With each type of training, there are details that apply to older dogs.\nCrate traininga dog of any age involves teaching them to be happy in their crate, and this applies to older dogs as well. Never force them to go into the crate, but set up situations so they want to go in, and repeat them a lot. Put high-quality treats in the front of the crate so they are easy to reach from outside. Once they love going to get thosetreats, gradually toss them further in so the dog willingly enters the crate.\nAfter they will go all the way in to get treats, start closing the door to the crate, but at first, close it for just a second, being sure to open it before they are done with the treats. Gradually increase the time they are in the crate with the door closed. Once they are comfortable in the crate with the door closed, put them in there for very brief periods — starting with less than a minute — with a stuffed food toy they can work on. Add to the time until they love their crate.\nFor older dogs specifically, use a crate that does not require them to step high to enter. Put really soft cozy padded bedding in there so they can be comfortable. Don’t leave them in there so long that they reach the point they are desperate to potty or can’t hold it.\nPotty training, house training, teaching them where the bathroom is — whatever you call it, it’s an essential skill if we want to enjoy sharing a home with our dogs. Always consider there may be a medical reason an older dog regresses on their house training, and take them to the veterinarian. Similarly, if a recent addition to your family thinks your living room is the bathroom, a visit to the veterinarian is in order. Once medical issues have been treated or ruled out, then you can work on potty training.\nA dog who is still being house trained must always be in one of three situations — outside with someone observing to see if they go, inside under constant supervision so you can get them outside ASAP if they show signs of squatting or lifting a leg, or in a confined area such as a crate or laundry room where they are not likely to choose to go. Whenever your dog pees or poops outside, which is what you want, offer calm praise until they are done, and then a treat as fast as you can get it to them. Go to them to deliver the treat, or they will think coming to you or coming inside earned the treat, and we want them to know it was their excellent bathroom choice that led to the treat.\nTips you’ll want to pay attention to.\nTake older dogs outside more often than you think necessary, sometimes every 20 to 30 minutes because many older dogs can’t hold it for long. If they seem hesitant to go, take them on different surfaces. Some dogs prefer grass, others like leaves, and dirt is preferred by many as well. Offer them opportunities on walks, and in your yard to find out what they prefer.\nThe key toleash trainingan older dog is making sure your dog is comfortable and that being on a leash is a happy, fun experience. For comfort for an older dog who is not used to walking on a leash, use a leash that’s as thin and lightweight as possible, and consider a leash that is longer than the standard six-foot leash if your dog prefers to have a little more space. Use a comfortable collar, perhaps with some padding, and don’t make it any tighter than it needs to be to prevent them slipping out if it. Some dogs feel more at ease with the leash attached to aharnessinstead of the collar, so that is an excellent option. Minimize the weight of any tags and tape them together to prevent the jingling so many dogs find irritating.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for turning a stressful walk into a chill stroll.\nTo make being on a leash fun, give your dog lots of great treats during leash training — any time the dog is by your side or walking without pulling you, offer a treat. While on leash, let them sniff and enjoy themselves so walking is an adventure and not a chore. Teach them to associate being on a leash with good adventures and locations. So, walk them to the park, or to the car to go someplace fun if they enjoy being in the car.\nHow to Obedience Train Your Older Dog\nTraining your older dog to respond to basic cues can make both of your lives so much better, and knowing how allows you to reap the benefits of the effort it takes. Training your dog to do as you ask has so many benefits.\nTo achieve the goal of training your dog, usepositive reinforcement, set your dog up for success by arranging the environment so your dog is not doomed to fail, start with what’s easiest for your dog to learn, and train a little bit multiple times each day. Consistency is the key to training a dog. Train when your dog is most likely to pay attention, leaving times of the day when they struggle to focus for other activities like playing, going on walks, or grooming.\nWell-trained dogs have more freedom (and more fun).\nTools: The tools for training an older dog are a leash for outside work in any area that is not fenced, excellent treats that are soft and easy to chew but not too big, a quiet environment, and toys they like. Bring these items as well as your patience because our dogs deserve all kinds of grace when they are learning new things. It won’t go perfectly, and there will be mistakes, and that’s OK.Time: One of the secrets of professional dog trainers is that short training sessions are the best training sessions. Dogs don’t typically learn well if they are required to concentrate for 10, 15, or 20 minutes or more. Multiple short session of 30 seconds to three minutes multiple times a day are far more effective. You will see big changes in a few days and weeks and even more as the months go by if you stick with short, regular sessions of training. Older dogs may fatigue easily or feel full if you do too much training at once.\nDIY ways to help your pup cope with the pain.\nStep One\nThe first step in training your older dog is to somehow get the dog to perform the behavior you want so you can reinforce them, making them more likely to do it in the future. Sometimes the behavior is something the dog naturally does naturally, such as lying down, and for such common behaviors, be ready to respond with a treat or other reinforcement when they do it on their own. Dog trainers refer to this as “catching your dog doing something right,” or “capturing behavior” and it’s a powerful part of training.\nAnother option is to lure your dog into position using a treat. Dogs tend to follow their nose, so if you can use a treat to get their nose where you want it, you can elicit the desired behavior. To lure a dog into a sit, for example, put the treat right by their nose and then slowly move it back over their head, which causes many dogs to life their head and put their butt on the ground.\nThe most mouth-watering treats for training your pup.\nShaping is a process of reinforcing progressively closer approximations of the behavior you want. Many behaviors do not appear fully formed, but you can reinforce your dog along the way to the final goal. For example, if you are teaching your dog to roll over, you start by reinforcing them for lying down in early sessions. As you progress, you reinforce them for lying down on one hip rather than straight in a sphinx position, then for lying on their side, then for making it all the way onto their back. Finally, the dog can only earn the treat for fully rolling over — a behavior that is hard to get them to do fully in a single step.\nStep Two\nThe second step is to add the cue for the behavior you want. It’s one thing to have the dog perform a desired behavior, and another thing entirely to do it because you give them a cue that tells them what you want them to do. Dog trainers consider that the cue is a message to their dog that it’s a green light to perform the behavior in order to receive a treat for doing so. So, how do you connect the cue to the behavior so your dog knowsthiscue tells them to performthatbehavior?\nUh, who else gotthatmemo?\nTiming is everything, and a cue should only be taught to a dog after they understand the behavior you are teaching them can lead to treats or other reinforcement. That is not what most people do, but it is what professional trainers do. Instead of saying, “shake” at the beginning of the training process right before you try to get your dog to reach their paw out in your direction, hold off on saying that word until they frequently perform the behavior. If you say the cue before they know the behavior, the word has no meaning to them, and it just becomes background noise to them. That makes it harder to teach them to associate the word with the action.When your dog knows a certain behavior is likely to be reinforced,andyou can reliably predict that the dog is likely to perform the behavior, it’s time to introduce the cue you will use to ask your dog to do it. When you can predict that the dog is likely to present their paw within the next few seconds, say “shake,” and then offer your hand to the dog. If they shake, give them treats. Repeat. A lot. Do it over and over in short sessions over many days until they connect the work “shake,” with shaking your hand with their paw and will reliably offer a paw when they hear the cue.\nIn between cuddle sessions, work on these eight basic cues with your pup.\nFAQs\nOlder dogs can be trained and often learn new skills quickly because they have the focus some younger dogs lack.\nDogs continue learning throughout their lives, so it’s never too late to train them. Dogs of any age can learn new tricks, skills, and cues.\nTraining older dogs is no harder than training younger dogs. No matter their age, the goal is to teach your dog what you want them to do and reinforce them so they are glad they did it.\nOlder dogs learn basic cues the same way younger dogs do — with lots of repetition and with positive reinforcement, so they understand what to do and want to do it.\nPro Karen London, PhD shares the most common dog training errors and how to correct them.\nSit, down, stay, heel, come, leave it, and wait are the most common cues we need our dogs to understand and respond to.\nIt’s always best to train your own dog. Training is about developing an understanding between a person and a dog which enhances communication and benefits the relationship.\nPro tips on training your dog with the click of a button — literally.\nWhat to Keep in Mind About Training a Senior Dog\nIf you’ve been told you can’t teach an old dog new tricks, you have been misinformed. Older dogs are perfectly capable of learning new skills, tricks, and cues. Training them is not unlike training dogs of any age, though certain modifications make the process kinder and more effective for them. Older dogs benefit from the loving attention of training as much as from the new skills they acquire. Even if the dogs in your household resemble a canine retirement community, training can be a wonderful part of your life and of theirs.",

    },
    "page_content": "“Do you reinforce him when he does what you ask?”\nI frequently pose this question to my clients and one common response is, “Absolutely! I give him a treat every time.” Another answer I often hear is, “Yes, I always praise him and pet him, too!” Well, the good news, based on a Marchstudy, “Social interaction can function as a reinforcer for dogs: Effects of stimulus duration and session parameters,” by Erica Feuerbacher, Caitlin Togher, and Jonathan Friedel is that both responses — attention and food — can act as reinforcers to dogs, which makes them more likely to perform the desired behavior in the future.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nAttention is great. Adding food makes it more effective.\nIn other words, you can train your dog using social interaction,andyou can train your dog with food. But (spoiler alert!) research indicates that food is more effective, at least for some dogs. Having options, both backed by evidence from scientific research, is an excellent development in the field of science-based training, and a cause for celebration. As the authors write, “Our results suggest both durations of social interaction can function as a reinforcer, especially when delivered sporadically, but they are still not as effective as food as a reinforcer for most dogs.”\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nAccording to Feuerbacher, “Amazingly, despite what we have learned about dogs and as much as we interact with them, we didn’t really have any data showing clearly that human social interaction could or does function as a reinforcer for dogs. Ours was the first to clearly show that. It’s likely what many owners experience, but it’s always good to have data to back up our anecdotal observations. However, I think it’s worth pointing out that it’s not as effective, typically, as food still. So, we can use human social interaction as a reinforcer, but it likely needs to be interspersed with other valuable reinforcers.”\nBasically, your dog gets bored of getting positive attention without a treat.\nPrevious studies have shown mixed results about whether social interaction can function as a reinforcer, but in studies that found social interaction to be ineffective, the reason may have been because dogs get satiated on it quickly. In the current study, trials were spaced out over a long time period to avoid that problem.\nIn this study, the behavior used to evaluate potential reinforcers was targeting to a hand, or “touch” as it is frequently called. Dog parents held their hand at dog nose level for 30 seconds or until the dog touched the hand with their muzzle. The parent’s response varied across sessions, but they offered the planned reinforcer, whether that was four seconds of petting and praise, 30 seconds of petting and praise, or a verbal marker (“yip”) followed by food. In trials with no reinforcement, the person lifted their hand in response to muzzle touch, waited four seconds, and then did the next trial. If the dog did not perform the “touch” behavior within the 30 seconds, the person removed their hand, and then started the next trial. There were 10 trials in each session, and the data were the number of touch responses per session.\nThe most mouth-watering treats for training your pup.\nHere’s how the social interaction study worked.\nThe length of time for social interactions was chosen very thoughtfully. Feuerbacher says, “I chose four seconds because I had tested four seconds of social interaction in a previous paper because it was similar in time to how long it took me to deliver a piece of food to a dog; in that paper we found it was not very useful as a reinforcer, but we had different experimental parameters in that study (the sessions were back to back, with potentially greater numbers of trials, and interspersed with a food condition). So, I wanted to evaluate that under these new parameters.”  She goes on: “I also chose 30 seconds because another paper from other researchers had suggested that 30 seconds of social interaction was as effective as food for training dogs, but their study had some confounds. So, I wanted to clean that up and look at both of these that had had some published research on them already.”\nThe study did not find that the duration of social interaction made a difference in the touch behavior of dogs, but one dog did a lot more barking after receiving four seconds of social interaction than after experiencing 30 seconds of social interaction or after being given food following a correct response.\nThe key to curbing mindless snacking — this is for your dog.\nDogs generally responded more in sessions with social interaction than to sessions in which the pet parents offered no response. When comparing responses to social interactions versus food, two of the dogs responded to all cues to touch the hand in either condition, and one dog responded twice as much in the sessions in which food was offered compared with those in which social interaction was offered.\nIndividual variation, which is to be expected, is always important to consider, and it’s something that Feuerbacher is well aware of: “We saw some dogs that responded maximally for social interaction and others that didn’t. I think this highlights that owners need to pay attention to their dogs and find out what is meaningful and valuable to their dog. For some dogs, social interaction might be very valuable and a useful training option, but for others, they might not find it as reinforcing, and food or play are better options.”\nIf you don’t have treats on you, positive attention is still a great tool.\nWe know from previous research (not to mention a lot of people’s personal experiences!) that food works as a reinforcer, but it requires extra work for pet parents. Some people don’t want to use food, and allergies can be an issue in some households. The advantage of social interaction as a reinforcer is that people always have it available. You can leave your treats behind, but your ability to pet and praise your dog is always on hand, and that may be useful in persuading people to use positive reinforcement when training their dogs. Because social interaction requires no preparation ahead of time, it’s easy, and that may be all it takes for some people to turn to positive-reinforcement training.\nOffering fewer treats can actually be agoodthing.\nVocal praise is great, but your dog especially loves it when you pet them.\nThis study used both petting and praise combined for social interaction, but Feuerbacher thinks these are not equally valuable to dogs, saying, “While we didn’t directly explore whether it was petting, or vocal praise, or both contributed to the effect we saw, our prior research suggests it was likely petting that was driving our results. We have found no effect of adding vocal praise to food delivery on the efficacy of food as a reinforcer, and in other studies, dogs preferred petting much more than vocal praise.”\nThere is so much more to investigate about the value of social interaction for reinforcing canine behavior, and Feuerbacher is full of ideas for future studies. Of particular interest to her is what happens in more distracting situations: “I would really like to test social interaction as a reinforcer in a noisier environment — like outside or in a park. I suspect we might see that it can function as a reinforcer in settings where there is not a lot of other fun things for dogs to engage in, but might not function as well when competing with other environmental reinforcers such as good smells, other dogs, or squirrels!”\nHere are some simple steps to pry your pup away from thatonespot in the yard they’re obsessed with.\nSpoken like a scientist who knows, understands, and loves dogs — just like the rest of us.",

A German Shepherd/Husky cross whobarks, lunges, and charges at dogs walking by her house. A Poodle whogrowlsat other dogs when on leash. A mixed breed who is terrified of visitors and barks at them nonstop. A Papillon puppy who bites his elderly Labrador Retriever housemate when the older dog doesn’t want to play with him. What do these aggressive dogs have in common? All of them had their behavior improved through the use of play.\nHow Play-Training Helps with Aggression in Dogs\nYears ago, I began to regularly incorporate play into programs for aggressive dogs. Play is a powerful tool when working with aggressive dogs who are misbehaving because of frustration,arousal, lack of impulse control, boredom, orfear. Play has a positive effect on emotions, which is why play-motivated fearful dogs often respond better to play than totreats, even if they are also highly treat-motivated — fear decreases faster and more thoroughly in response to the former than to the latter. There are many different ways that play can help aggressive dogs to behave better.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHow It Works:\nTheoretically, you can stop a dog’s unwanted behavior by teaching them something incompatible with that behavior — for example, you can counteract a dog’s habit ofjumping on peopleby teaching them to sit in the presence of others. But when a dog struggles with high arousal (many aggressive dogs do), you’re more likely to have success by teaching the dog to perform anactivebehavior. Trying to teach a dog to lie down, stay, or another static, controlled behavior is more challenging and generally less effective.\nIf your dog loses their sh*t over anything—from a squirrel to a guest. Here are some tips to curtail that.\nOnce, I worked with a Corgi who was aggressive when people moved around, and the more aroused she was, the more reactive and out of control she became. My goal was to transfer that energy using her favorite game,fetch. Now, when people are active, she brings a ball to her people, who then play fetch with her. By itself, the act of getting a toy can have an inhibitory effect, but it’s even better to teach the dog to get a toy in order to initiate a game. The anticipation gave the Corgi a happy feeling: “Yay, somebody moved! That means playtime.”\nThe mixed breed, who was terrified of visitors, loved fetch and she warmed up fast to anyone who would play it with her. To take advantage of this, I used classical counterconditioning to change her emotional response to visitors. Specifically, I taught her to associate them with fetch; I wanted her to feel the same joy whenguests arrivedas she felt when playing fetch. So, everyone who entered her home threw a ball for her. Eventually, the appearance of a visitor became the cue that a game of fetch was about to happen. Instead of responding with fear because a stranger had entered, she now responds with enthusiasm.\nFor some dogs, it’s not as simple as just throwing a ball.\nThe German Shepherd/Husky cross, who reacted to dogs passing by, was easily aroused and struggled withimpulse control. Her pet parents, who had already tried calling her away and using treats to capture her attention, were convinced that she would never be able to focus on anything with another dog in sight. She was not just beyond their control but actually beyond her own control. However, she loved to play tug, and no matter how high her arousal was or what distractions were present, she was captivated by her tug rope.\nThis game was the perfect way to redirect her attention. Once she learned that when a dog came into view, she would be given an opportunity to play tug, she stopped going wild at the sight of a dog and instead, turned immediately and joyfully to her person for a play session. Tug helped her control herself.Tug has many advantages when working with an aggressive dog, as long as tug does not incite the aggression. It not only keeps the dog near you and their mouth occupied, it also allows you to direct the dog’s line of sight, which can be especially useful if the dog is visually stimulated. Dogs who tug usually love to play the game, which makes it a compelling option.\nChase? Wrestle? Tug-o-war? Find out which are fair game.\nThe Poodle who wasreactiveto other dogs when on leash is one of the most playful dogs I have ever known — and one of the smartest. His training was excellent, and he could perform many behaviors on cue, even in the presence of another dog. But if he saw the dog first, he would bark,lunge, and pullso hard on the leash that he had caused his person to fall more than once.All of that changed when I started reinforcing him with play. If he controlled himself when he saw another dog — performing any behavior other than reacting — he was allowed to play. He was willing to work for play, but the play had to be the “right” kind:running after his person. Once this reinforcement system was established, when he saw another dog, he would look at her as if to say, “Well, don’t you have some running to do?” and then happily chase after her.\nA few minutes — or even a few steps — are all you need to add joy to your dog’s day.\nFrustration and boredom were the root causes in the case of the Papillon puppy who was aggressive to the Labrador Retriever. The older dog was interested in playing with the puppy for no more than two to three minutes at a time, but the puppy wanted to frolic morning, noon, and night. When the Lab called a halt, thepuppy would growl, leap on the Lab and bite him, sometimes causing injuries.It was essential to find other ways to engage the Papillon in play — ways that would provide him with enough fun, mental and physical exercise, and other stimulation to keep him happy. The first step was to determine which toys, games, and activities appealed to him. Never has my job been easier, because this dog loved everything. I imagined him thinking, Plush toys? I love them. They’re my favorite. Tug toys? I love them. They’re my favorite. Balls? I love them. They’re my favorite.\nCue theSchoolhouse Rock!because learning can be fun.\nEvery single thing I tried was a success — puzzle-toys, squeaky toys, bouncy toys, rope toys, balls, disks, Kongs. He liked them all. Discovering a variety of new games and either learning or inventing ways to play with different toys satisfied his intense need for play. He played fetch, tug, chase, and hide-and-seek with people. When people weren’t available, he learned to enjoy throwing objects in the air and catching them,puzzlesof all sorts, dribbling a ball around like a soccer star, and rolling balls down ramps and then chasing after them. Between the variety of toys and the multiple “play stations” we set up around his house, he learned to entertain himself for long stretches at a time.\nOnce I showed his pet parents new ways to play with their puppy, they interacted with him much more, which took a lot of pressure off the older dog. Now, the Papillon plays appropriately and briefly with the Lab a few times a day, and when the Lab is done, the puppy chooses a different way to play. Providing additional options was essential in helping this puppy behave in an acceptable manner around the other dog in his family.There are many ways to change aggressive behavior, and an important part of my work is deciding which one will work best for a particular dog. While play is not part of the solution for every dog, it can help many of them, and increasingly, I find that I can help people and their dogs succeed by incorporating play into their programs. Yes, play is fun, but when working with aggressive dogs, it can be so much more.",

    },
    "page_content": "As someone prone to verbal blunders, I’m intimately familiar with the concept of an awkward introduction. But rather than just general weirdness after nervously saying the exact wrong thing, ill-advised greetings can have serious lingering effects on dogs. This is especially true for one of the most common meeting setups — face-to-face on leash.\n“I strongly suggest people don’t have on-leash greetings,” warns Charlie DiBono, trainer and founder ofBody and Mind K9in Long Beach, California. He explains that leashes are one of the best tools for communicating with our dogs, and when we introduce them to other pets while they’re on one, it can jeopardize that connection. Not to mention, it risks devaluing any obedience training they’ve had. This is because when our pup sees another dog, and we allow them to meet, we tend to tighten the leash. But that tells the dog that we are nervous and, therefore, they should be, too. This communication can result in increasedanxietyor a fight.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nThe Problem With On-Leash Greetings\n“When meeting on-leash, dogs are coming at each other head-on. In the dog world, this means ‘I am a threat.’ It is natural for the dogs to feel defensive and react accordingly,” DiBono says. Even if an interaction is entirely positive on the surface and both dogs are cordial and calm, it can still cause problems almost immediately. After a lovely meet-and-greet, your pup will now want to say hello to every other dog they see. And if you don’t oblige, they may get frustrated and resort toleash reactivityorpulling.\nThe impetus of these risks for dogs on leashes is the same reason I stay off Tinder — it’s an unnatural way of meeting. “Dogs naturally greet each other by sniffing each other’s rear ends and circling around each other. They typically approach in an arc rather than a straight line in an effort to show they are not a threat. This behavior is difficult to replicate while on a leash and the tension from the leash can cause reactivity in dogs, leading toaggressionor fear,” DiBono explains.\nTwo animal behavior experts agree it’s usuallyplay fighting. Here’s how you can tell.\nHow On-Leash Greetings Affect Your Dog in the Long-Term\nThere are far-reaching, lingering effects of putting dogs in these types of situations. Not only will your dog potentially develop anxiety about going outside and seeing other dogs, or develop leash reactivity issues, but they may also lose trust in you. This can diminish your authority in communication and make training much more difficult. DiBono adds, “When the relationship between the owner and dog becomes untrustworthy, the dog begins to think they can ignore their owner and always run up to other dogs or that they can’t trust the owner to protect their boundaries.”\nDiBono explains that the ideal scenario for two dogs to meet is in a neutral and controlled environment with both animals off-leash. This can be afenced-in yardor any enclosed space. Inviting aprofessional trainerto oversee the introduction, especially if the pets are unfamiliar with each other, would also be immensely helpful. Additionally, avoiding places with high stimuli, like busy parks or crowded streets, will help minimize adverse reactions. It’s also good to schedule the meetup around a time that is not mealtime or near favorite toys that dogs may feel protective over.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nHow to Make Your On-Leash Greeting Less Risky\nIf you must introduce your dog on a leash, there is a way to limit the negative consequences. DiBono recommends first walking with both dogs parallel to one another, allowing one to fall behind and sniff the other, then vice versa. After a hopefully encouraging initial meeting, he suggests going to a large enclosed space. You can then drop your leash, but DiBono adds to not remove the leash from the dog’s collar in the event that you must intervene.\nMore than anything, if you’re out on a walk, understand that you have no obligation to anyone or anyone’s dog except your own. “I would avoid all strange dogs, DiBono says. “Your dog has no need to say hello and both dogs will be safer for it. If you take your dog in public, often it’s up to you to advocate for them and not allow others to rush them. Stick to dogs whose temperament and owners you are familiar with.”",

    "page_content": "Now that your new dog is home (and staring at you), what’s next? Well, after you give them a treat just for being perfect, it’s time to prioritize one thing: Training. Dog training is a key element in new-dog bonding, and no dog is too old to learn new tricks. It’s true: Dogs thrive when their minds are engaged.\nTo begin, it all starts with a “cue.” In dog training, a cue is a signal to the dog (either verbal or physical, or both) to do a particular behavior. As you and your dog work together, your dog will associate a cue with a new skill or a cool trick.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nRemember, dog training is meant to be rewarding and fun for both of you. So, keep training brief, just five to ten minutes, at the start, and always end on a positive note. Below you’ll find the top eight most important dog training tricks that, with some gentle teaching, your dog can master. Learning these training cues and behaviors allows your dog to reap the benefits of being a well-mannered member of society.\nOur room-to-room guide to get your house in dog-safe shape.\nBasic Training Cues for Dogs\nDon’t move forward.Teaching a dog to wait is especially useful at doors. Dogs who wait are easier to take on walks and let in and out ofthe carbecause they don’t go through the door until given permission. The wait cue is also a great safety prompt. Teaching this canprevent a dog from running out a doorinto traffic and reduce some of the chaos inherent in living with dogs. Teaching a dog to wait also allows people to catch up during off-leash walks if the dog has gone ahead.\nLook at my face.Teaching a dog to watch you helps get a dog’s attention and distract them from problematic situations, such as the unexpected presence of another dog.\nPut your butt on the ground.Teaching a dog to sit is one of the easiest things to teach dogs to do. It’s a useful calming cue and — sitting is incompatible with many undesirable behaviors — can be useful in defusing otherwise touchy situations.\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nRemain in place until released.Teaching a dog “stay” helps dogs practice self-control. It also keeps dogs in one spot when necessary. Stay is helpful in many situations ranging from “It’s dinnertime and our guests are not dog people” to “I just broke a glass in the kitchen and you’ll cut your paws if you come in here before I clean it up.”\nRun to me. Run directly to me. Do not stop at the dead squirrel.Dogs who reliably come when called can safely be given more freedom. Once your dog masters being able to come reliably in your home, move on to environments with higher stimulation.\nYou are free to go.Teaching a release cue to a dog like “Okay” or “Free” gives your dog permission to stop doing what you previously asked them to do. Used most commonly with “Wait” and “Stay,” it tells your dog that the behavior no longer needs to be performed. For example, your dog can get up and move around if they’ve been staying or go through the door if they’ve been waiting.\nFor some dogs, it’s not as simple as just throwing a ball.\nSay hello without jumping.In this case, the appearance of a new person, rather than a word or a hand signal, is the cue to keep all four paws on the ground. Many dogs do the opposite — jump on every new person — and that can make both pet parents and guests uncomfortable. Few behaviors are more appreciated in dogs than the skill ofgreeting people politely.\nPerforming an endearing trick on cue shows off a dog’s training better than most practical skills. Sure, it may be harder to teach a dog to stay or come when called than to high-five, wave, spin, or roll over, but not many people know that. So, most people will be impressed by the trick and charmed by your pup as a result.",

    "page_content": "According to many dog psychologists and trainers, Nina Ottosson is one of the best in the business when it comes to designing and developinginteractive toys for dogs. These mentally stimulating puzzle toys are meant to promote activity in dogs, despite their humans’ busy schedules. Ottosson knows firsthand how necessary her puzzles are. “I have always had dogs, cats, and other animals. I used to train and compete with my Bouvier des Flandres dogs,” Ottosson tells Kinship. “But when my two kids were born a year-and-a-half apart, I did not have time to activate my dogs the way they and I were used to. My bad conscience made me start thinking about how to activate my dogs in a simple, fun, and varied way indoors, together with my kids.”\nUltimately, the brand’s objective is a simple one. “My goal is for dogs and their owners around the world to have fun with my products,” Ottosson shares. All of Ottosson’s toys were designed to for petsandtheir people. “I call them ‘games’ because the owner and the pet are supposed to play together, which strengthens the bond between them,” she adds. So, whether you’re trying to ease tension when introducing a new pet into the family, teaching children how to engage with animals, or teaching your pup new tricks, you’ll be working toward your goal while connecting with your pet.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nMaterials were also a consideration. All Nina Ottosson products are non-toxic, BPA, PVC and phthalate free, and have been FDA-tested. “I only use the best materials, since my dogs, as well as your dogs, will use the products,” Ottosson says. Below, a breakdown on why animals need stimulation, how to connect with your pet through training and playtime, and which level of toy to start them on.\nWild animals get natural mental stimulation when hunting for food, which inspired me when developing the games to match the dog’s natural movements and instincts. All dogs (and other pets) need to use their brain in order to keep them mentally healthy. Some dogs need more mental stimulation than others.\nIf dogs are not provided with an outlet for their energy in the form of different types of activity or other stimulation, they becomeboredand can sometimes find their own “activity,” which we, as dog-owners, often do not appreciate, likechewing,barking, or just general hyperactivity.\nPuzzle games are not a test for problem-solving skills; it is more like a “tool” for the dog to use its natural instincts, just as we give our children toys to play with, like Legos. It’s not the final result we strive for. It is the time they try and play their way to a result that is important, not to evaluate their abilities.\nDogs need to explore in their own way. Treat-puzzle games are a fun and easy way to stimulate the dog’s senses, like their mind and nose, by using their natural instincts. A dog needs an outlet for their energy daily; some dogs require more than others, but all dogs need it in different ways.\nThe way I see it, the journey is more important than the destination. It’s about the experience itself for the dog, not just to reach the goal of solving the puzzle, but enjoying the activity as well as the reward. You have to keep trying. Like when you are hunting in nature, you don’t always catch something.\nWhen you start out, use something really tasty to give the dog an incentive to work for it. Dogs who are food-motivated will be happy to work for their food.\nI recommend starting to use the games with puppies, which is what I have done with my dogs. It’s important to start with games that are simple. Play for a very short time, play together, be positive, and give lots of praise. Start at an appropriate level for your dog. If your dog has never done anything like this, “level one” might be best. But if you have a smart dog who has done similar things before and is food motivated, you might be able to start at a higher level.\nJust be careful that it’s not so difficult that the dog gets frustrated. Fill all the compartments with treats when the dog is watching, and leave some of the treats visible for an easy win. In the beginning, you have to show your dog the playing rules and how it works, and maybe even help them “cheat” a little. Always supervise, so the dog doesn’t try to chew his way to the treats.\nPuzzles for dogs are like crosswords and Sudoku for us. We need to understand the rules of the game, how to solve it, or get help, especially if we try a more difficult version. If we don’t understand, we get frustrated and give up. Instead, dogs may start to chew and come up with their own solutions to find the treats, which is natural. So, we need to teach the dog how to play, so they understand how to play to find the treats, and step-by-step move up to more advanced puzzles.\nThe puzzles are a great way to teach your dog different commands like wait, sit, stay, etc. It’s fun; they get treats and you do something fun together.\nYou can vary them in different ways. In some puzzles, you can add blocks to make them more difficult. You can also make a frozen puzzle by mixing some meaty dog food with water, or add natural yogurt and some tasty treats and freeze the puzzle, to make play time last longer. Another way is to put the game up on a stool, to make the dog only work with his mouth and nose, and not with his paws. A great tip is to make a puzzle race with several puzzles in a row, and hide a few treats in each puzzle. You can also hide puzzles in different rooms/places, behind doors, under a blanket, etc, and let the dog search for the puzzles.\nAll my puzzle games can be used by dogs of all sizes, ages, and breeds. But some are better suited for puppies, without small or loose parts. Some puzzles have large or shallow treat compartments, which are best suited forflat-nosed dogs. Some are made in a plastic/wood composite material, which is heavier and sturdier and suitable for rough dogs. For dogs that are easily bored, I recommend an easier game that gives immediate rewards. They can also be adapted to different sizes, for example by tying strings in removable parts, to make it easier to lift for small dogs.\nBest Interactive Toys for Dogs by Level\nChoosing which level to start your dog on is kind of like figuring out what reading level your kid is at. We want them to be challenged, but not to the point of frustration. Here’s what to know about keeping your dog engaged without overcommitting them to a too-tough toy.\nBtw, our editors (and their pets) picked out these products. They’re always in stock at the time we publish, but there’s a chance they’ll sell out. If you do buy through our links, we may earn a commission. (We’ve got a lot of toys to buy over here, you know?)\nSuitable for beginners, small dogs, and puppies, this interactive toy’s baby blue hue is just one way it signals that it’s a solid choice for fledgling pups. Made with nine large hiding compartments that are difficult to chew through, the toy’s moveable pieces will stand up against razor-sharp puppy fangs.\nIf you’re looking for a tip from the pros, Ottosson suggests starting by tying a durable string to the bone-shaped plastic pieces. This allows dogs who are new to puzzle games to reach their treat more easily if they’re struggling to figure out how to move the pieces on their own.\nWorried about your pupgetting boredof their new toy too quickly? Ottosson has thought of that, too. “Some people wonder if the dogs get tired of the games. I compare that to playing games like Monopoly or cards — we know how to play it, but it’s still exciting and fun to play, and the same is true for dogs and my games.” Based on this philosophy (and thousands of five-star reviews), your dog will enjoy their version of checkers for years to come.\nThe treat-dispensing tumbler toy is ideal for dogs who have trouble sitting still — at least this way they’ll have something to chase around your apartment besides their own shadow. Made for your pup to sniff around to find ways to release their reward, the puzzle-ball toy can also be loaded with dog food and used as a slow feeder for over-eager pups and those on a vet-recommendedweight-managementprogram.\n“They are great for dogs that are overweight, because they have to work for their food, and underweight dogs as well,” Ottosson notes. “Many dogs are happier to eat when the food is put in the games instead of a bowl.” This toy also suits dogs who prefer the excitement of being hand-fed rather than eating directly from their bowl, but the upside is, they can enjoy it all on their own. Once your pup gets the hang of it, you can put a piece of paper in the toy to make it harder to get to the treat.\nFeaturing three tiers with 12 compartments for dog snacks or kibble, the white blocks lock into this toy, making it a harder nut to crack for most dogs, and therefore, a level two in difficulty. “I realized from the beginning, especially after having tested these games on different dogs, that my games must have different levels of difficulty to fit as many dogs as possible,” Ottosson says. “Some dogs are happy with games that are simple and easy, while others need increasingly difficult ones.”\nIf your pup falls into the latter camp, they’ll benefit from this engaging intermediate level puzzle toy that ups the ante when it comes to uncovering treats. Ottosson advises adding a string to the blocks to help your dog lift up the blocks and realize the treat is the goal here. Please monitor your dog while playing with this toy, especially, if you attach a string to it, because string is achoking hazardthat can also cause a GI obstruction. —AF\nSome of the toys, while more mentally challenging, are ideal for keeping injured dogs and those with mobility issues engaged throughout the day. “When my dogs have been injured I have placed the games on a chair or in my lap, so they have to work with the nose and not with their injured paw,” Ottosson advises. “It can be very challenging to keep an injured dog still for several weeks, but the games are a great activity that lets the dog get an outlet for all its energy.”\nThis toy holds up to a cup of kibble, so you can give your dog an activity that doesn’t require physical activity — aside from using their nose to uncover the goods from the toy’s 24 compartments. It is a level three, after all.\nThis advanced toy is best for easily bored dogs. Treats can be accessed by twisting the bone locks on the six treat drawers. Hyperactive dogs will enjoy sniffing around to swivel, pull, and unlock the drawers, revealing a tasty treat. If you want to make things easier for your pup, tie string on the orange handles to make them easier to pull out. Remember the warning about string.\nOnce you’ve mastered levels one and two, your dog can move on to the more challenging stuff, like this toy with hidden compartments that require swivelling, scooting and spinning to unlock. It’s a treat for all types of dogs, including injured dogs andseniors.\n“I have a lot of experience with older dogs that were not able to go for walks due to worn-out hips and joints,” says Nina. “Despite this, they were very alert because we played games together daily. I am convinced that their final years were enriched because of this.” The interactive toy will keep your older dog busy for hours as they use their instincts to hunt for treats.",

    "page_content": "If comedies likeThe OfficeandAbbott Elementaryhave taught us anything, it’s that work doesn’t always have tofeellike work. Of course, most people don’t have entire camera crews following them around at their place of employment, but you get the point.\nTraining your dog can kind of feel like working on a mockumentary sitcom; you’re always working, but it doesn’t come without its funny, entertaining moments (but let’s maybe leave the circa 2005 Michael Scott jokes off the table). School is in session every time you interact with your dog — even during lighthearted play, they are always learning. Here are seven games that’ll teach your dog valuable lessons and help them be upstanding members of society — all while having a blast.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\n1. Chase (you)\nConsider this game if you’re convinced that your dog doesn’t like to play; once they’ve been enticed into a game of chase, you may see their fun side come alive.\nAnother plus: When you want to reward your dog but have notreatsor toys handy, chase can be a go-to way to make your dog glad they listened to you. And, because it teaches your dog to move toward rather than away from you, it can help withrecall training. Importantly, your dog must always chase you, not the other way around. Never chase your dog; it will teach them to run away when you approach and ruin their recall.\nKinshipCollective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a stubborn pup to listen up.\nWhile “chase” can easily turn into the not-so-wise-or-fun game of “let’s nip the human’s ankles, legs, or behind,” for the right dog played the right way, it can be a fantastic way to teach your dog to pay attention to you because you’re fun. Change directions often, and to avoid trouble with an aroused dog becomingmouthy, stop running before your dog gets to you.\nOne caveat: I advise against children playing this game unless the dog has a proven record of being able to handle it without becomingoverstimulated, and even then, only with adult supervision.\n2. Fetch\nWhen we think about playing with dogs, this is the game that most often comes to mind.Fetchis a cooperative activity, and each player has a role that must be fulfilled for it to work. (Many people tell me that their dog loves to play fetch and then go on to say that the dog chases the ball but won’t bring it back, or won’t drop it. That’s not fetch — that’s running after a ball and hoarding it.)\nFor some dogs, it’s not as simple as just throwing a ball.\nFetch has a lot to offer, including the skill of dropping an item upon request. It also provides opportunities to work on high-level obedience training. After a few throws, during which the dog has retrieved an item, brought it back to you, and dropped it at your feet, take a short break and ask them to do something specific: sit, down, high-five, or any behavior they can do on cue. Then resume play. Adding this mental stimulation into a game of fetch can be done sporadically so that most sessions are pure fun and games for your dog.\nBy switching between the excitement of running and the discipline of responding to a cue, the dog learns to transition between high arousal and being calm. Teaching dogs to have an on/off switch develops emotional control that will serve them well throughout life. (Another perk: Your dog gets exercise without much effort on your part, which is particularly appealing when you just want to enjoy your morning coffee while your dog burns up some energy.)\nThe most mouth-watering treats for training your pup.\n3. Find Your Treats\nDogs have a lot of fun with this deceptively simple treasure hunt, but the “treasure” must be something your dog cares enough about to search for.Nose workgives your dog mental stimulation, keeps them occupied for a while, and is a great party trick that allows your dog to show off.\nBegin by putting some treats on the floor or furniture without your dog seeing you do it. Say the cue (“find it” or “find your treat” are frequently used) and tap or point to the treats. Repeat…a lot…over many days or weeks. When your dog starts to look for the treats upon hearing the cue, drop the tap or point. Once your dog is familiar with the game, have them stay, then release them to find the treats. At first, hide the treats before you ask them to stay; after your dog’s stay is solid, you can have them do so while you hide the treats, either within sight or even in another room.\nCaveat: If your dog is a food-guarder, skip this game. Also, it may teach your dog to sniff around and get into stuff.\nYou don’t have to look like you belong onBest in Showto be a contender.\n4. Hide-and-Seek\nHere’s another enrichment game that teaches your dog to go on a search, but with you as the focus of the quest. It’s a great way to practice and improve a dog’s ability to come when called. To play, they must already know what “come” means.\nBegin indoors. Call your dog when you are partially out of sight, perhaps crouched down next to a piece of furniture or behind a plant that doesn’t entirely conceal you. When your dog finds you, reinforce them with top-quality stuff — treats, a toy, a bone, a chew, play time, or awalk. Gradually work up to more obscure hiding spots, until you can be completely hidden from sight when you call her.\nAdd in “stay” practice by putting your dog on a stay, hiding, then releasing them and calling them to come. For many dogs, the anticipation of being released makes them respond even more enthusiastically when called.\nThis sounds like a competition show waiting to happen.\nExpect your dog’s recall to improve dramatically if you play this game on a regular basis. You are teaching your dog that “come” means to do it even if you are not in plain view, and because it’s a game with reinforcements, dogs find it fun and worthwhile.\nPlaying this game when you are out in a (safe) off-leash area teaches your dog to keep an eye on you, and helps them understand that if the two of you become separated, they should look for you. And vice-versa — it’s not one-sided.\nCaveat: Disappearing around an aloof dog outside may not prompt any concern at all, and disappearing from view around a clingy dog anywhere may be upsetting.\n5. Family Circle\nThis is a special kind of hide-and-seek in which dogs are told to find a specific person. To play, the dog needs to understand and respond to the “come” cue and you’ll need a few people.\nWhen it’s time to call in reinforcements.\nFirst, have someone else call out your name: “Where’s Karen?” After that, you should call the dog. If they come to you, they get reinforced, but if they go to somebody else, they get ignored. Once you have rewarded your dog for finding you, ask them to find another person. For example, say, “Where’s Rob?” and then Rob should call the dog to come.\nMostdogs learn people’s namesquickly and begin to head to the right person once they hear the name, even before the cue. At that point, you can mix it up — sometimes calling them to come (to maintain a strong recall), sometimes saying only “Where’s [name]?” Once the dog can succeed in that context, up the stakes by having people stay out of sight, perhaps in other rooms, so the dog needs to search.\nLearning the names of everyone in the family is more than just a cool party trick or a practical way to locate someone. It’s also another way to give the dog exercise without a lot of work on your part.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\n6. Tug\nThere are many reasons toplay tug with dogs, and one of the most obvious is that so many of them love it. More reasons: it’s interactive, it’s a way to provide a dog with exercise in a relatively small space, and it can help them stretch before another activity or rev them up before a competition (if that leads to a better performance).\nThe game requires that a dog knows (or learns) how to respond to cues to take a toy and to drop it, which are related skills. Incorporated into the game itself, they are easier to teach. The game is the reward for taking an object, and dropping it can be reinforced with a treat and then resuming the tugging.\nThese skills can be useful in real life as well. Use “take it” when you want your dog to carry something small for you, or “drop it” when they’ve gotten hold of, say, the title to your car, which actually happened to a client of mine.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nWith tug, many dogs also learn to control their mouths and the emotions that can cause their mouths (and the rest of them!) to spiral out of control. Contrary to once-popular opinion, it will not make a behaviorally stable dog “turn aggressive.”\nCaveat: This game can be problematic for dogs who guard objects or those who become aggressive when highly aroused. It’s best for dogs who do not struggle with impulse control orbite inhibition.\n7. Red Light, Green Light\nThis one, borrowed from a game enjoyed by children, teaches dogs to listen to cues even when excited. The impulse control involved in repeatedly stopping and starting is a great life skill that often spreads to other contexts. Sometimes, a dog who is having trouble with self-control will be able to pull it together after several of the transitions between the excited running and stopping that make up the core of this game. Other dogs calm down if you play it in a very tranquil, slow manner. Different styles of the game work best for different dogs.\nIt can be played one-on-one in the living room or during a walk, or in teams in a class setting, with multiple dogs competing to reach a finish line. In order to play, the dog needs to be able to watch the human member of the team and respond to a “sit” or “down” cue.\nHere are some simple steps to pry your pup away from thatonespot in the yard they’re obsessed with.\nWhen they hear “green light,” dogs walk or run next to their human. When they hear “red light,” they must stop and lie down or sit (depending on the skill being worked on and which cue the dog is capable of responding to).\nWhen the game is played in class, if the dog is unable to lie down or sit on cue within three to five seconds, the team pays a penalty — taking three steps backward or returning to the start line, for example.\nThere is more to playing with our dogs than just having a good time, though that’s certainly enough to make it worthwhile. While you and your best friend are having fun, the game serves double duty as a practical way to teach important skills.",

Sleepypod is my go-to for car travel, from road trips to short trips across town for playdates.\nSleepypod has passed thesafety testperformed by Center for Pet Safety, a third-party company that does crash testing. Smaller dogs should ride in a crash-tested carrier, while medium-to-large dogs should be in a crash-tested harness. No matter what product you buy, ensure it’s passed third-party crash testing. And, just like children, dogs shouldn’t be riding in the front seat.\nKongsare a staple in my home. From puppies to seniors, everyone can enjoy a Kong. Studies have taught us that licking and chewing help release stress in dogs, and the Kong helps achieve that while allowing your pup to have fun. It also helps our dog get some mental enrichment and learn to settle and focus on something.\nI could probably use a Kong for myself. Stuff with your dog’s favorite treats and somepeanut butter, yogurt, or fruit, and let your dog enjoy! I have at least three Kongs in rotation at my house for my dogs and my clients: One for today, one to be cleaned, and one in the freezer for tomorrow. Forstrong chewers, check out the black Kong.\nI love having a safe place for my dogs; all my dogs are crate trained. It gives them a safe place to relax away from overwhelming house parties or fireworks.Crate trainingalso helps speed uppotty training, reduceseparation anxietyand makes vet visits, groomers, andemergency situationsless stressful for all of us. The Diggs Revol crate is my go-to — not only is it aesthetically nice looking, it is extremely easy to collapse and set up.\nDiamond-shaped sides prevent entrapment by collars and tags, multiple access points make it easy for my dogs to enter from multiple sides, and I love the custom accessories that fit the Revol crate. Our crate has traveled to many hotel rooms, TV sets, and more, and I know our adventures have just started together.\nDogs deserve to play, and I love toys that keep them busy. P.L.A.Y. makes my hands-down favorite plush dog toys (and Rossi, my dog, would agree). A current favorite is the soda can; I stick in a few treats or pieces of his food and then let him dig, tug, and play with it. From tacos that rip apart, french fries that can be flung all over, avocado toast, pet passports and so much more, your pet’s hunger for adventure is sure to be satiated.\nPaikka makes some of my favorite pet products. Their collection of reflective gear, including a treat bag — which I may or may not use as a purse sometimes — and jackets for humans and dogs, is a favorite of mine. It looks like normal gear but is extremely reflective, so no matter where we go, we can be seen at night and during the day. I also love their recovery line that promotes blood circulation, which is perfect for afterhikes,chilly days, and oursenior pets.\nThe Blue-9 Klimb is a training platform, but it’s so much more than that. I use this for training every dog. When a dog is elevated off the ground, they are more likely to focus and stay and have a more successful training session. By teaching your dog to go to the Klimb and relax, you can teach your dog to settle anywhere, from cafés to bustling train stations.\nI also use the Klimb fortraining behaviors, such as heeling, notjumping on guestsat the front door, not bolting out the front door, paws up, crawl, “go under,” “back up,” and so much more! The Klimb is UV stabilized, so training outside is no problem. It’s a staple in our home, and it makes training and keeping our dogs safe so much easier.\nMental enrichment is really important to dogs; boredom leads to many unwanted behaviors, such asbarking,chewing, and destroying items. The snoop is one of my go-to favorites for meeting pups’ mental stimulation needs. Put small treats inside for quick, easy success and some bigger treats to keep your pup occupied and busy. Have afast eater? Try putting in their kibble, too. I love that this toy is quiet on hardwood floors but still provides endless fun.\nDiggers need to dig. I often hear frustration from pet parents about theirdogs diggingin the yard, couch, and on the bed. Dogs naturally love to dig; it’s an innate desire. Instead of reprimanding your dog(s) for digging, give them somewhere to dig. And yes, evencatslove this toy! My dog actually isn’t a digger, but this is his hands-down favorite toy and, best of all, he is exhausted after playing with it. Hide some treats, your dog’s dinner, or even just toys inside and let your dog have fun digging! I put this toy away when they are done digging; this helps them stay interested in it and prevents them from chewing on the digging flaps.",

    "page_content": "Everybody loves a meet-cute. Whether it’s Julia Roberts bumping into Hugh Grant at a bookstore or Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan reluctantly carpooling from Chicago to New York City, a heavily orchestrated, yet charming, encounter never gets old. Hell, some recent rom-coms have even decided that’spretty much alla flick needs to work. With that in mind, you’d think vets would be more on board with the puppy version, but they are far from it. Most veterinary professionals strongly advise against any puppy socialization until they are fullyvaccinated. And while their hearts are in the right place, sheltering young dogs from the world can result in major issues later on.\nNot unlike most of my past relationships, the core issue with puppy socialization seems to be how you define it. “Most people get socialization wrong and think it is allowing their new puppy to play and interact with other dogs. As this poses a huge risk to unvaccinated puppies, vets have always said to wait until fully vaccinated to socialize,” says Charlie DiBono, trainer and founder ofBody and Mind K9in Long Beach, California.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nIf it’s time for a round of shots (no, not that kind), follow this guide.\nWhat does it actually mean to socialize puppies?\nDiBono explains that puppy socialization is about much more than just meeting other dogs; it involves introducing pets to the world. The first three or four months of a dog’s life are critical to how they will respond and interact with their surroundings going forward. This can create a bit of a problem because this window typically overlaps with the last round of vaccinations. But if you give your pup the full bubble-boy treatment, whenever they’re faced with new stimuli they will mirror anyone under the age of 35 trying to navigate the NYC subway system without a smartphone — terrified.\n“After the crucial socialization period ends at 16 weeks, puppies begin to meet everything with fear. Prior to this, they are much easier to rebound after a ‘scary’ moment,” DiBono says. And this fear can manifest as more than soleanxiety. If a puppy views anything unfamiliar as scary, behavioral issues can begin to develop.Leash, animal, and human reactivity are all potential risks of shielding your puppy from the outside world.\n“By properly socializing your puppy at a young age, their quality of life will be significantly better. They won’t live their life fearful, you won’t have to spend time worrying how they are going to react to someone or something, and when training is continued into the puppy’s adult life you will end up with a well-rounded dog who can go with you everywhere,” DiBono adds.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a shy pup to go from wallflower to social butterfly.\nHow can you keep your dog safe, pre-vaccines, while socializing them?\nTo be clear, this is not to say vaccines are unimportant or unnecessary. You should 1,000 percent not bring your pup to adog parkuntil they’ve had their shots. Just because the NFL lets Aaron Rodgers roll around in the dirt with his peers unvaccinated, doesn’t mean it’s a good idea for your dog to do it. If you did, it would leave your puppy vulnerable to a slew of dangerous conditions likeparvovirus,leptospirosis, ordistemper— all of which they can get from contact with other dogs.\nNow, that might initially seem like a tricky situation to navigate. How do you prioritize socialization without affecting your dog’s health ahead of full vaccination? According to DiBono, finding apuppy preschool classwith only pups between the ages of eight and 16 weeks is the ideal solution. “A good puppy preschool will introduce novel stimuli in a low-stress and positive way for the puppies, as well as help educate puppy parents on basic puppy manners such as mouthing,house training, body conditioning, and the beginning factors of how puppies learn,” he adds.\nNew kid on the block? Follow this trainer’s tips before letting your pet run wild.\nDiBono notes that puppy preschool is a fairly low-risk endeavor, especially in comparison to the alternative — withholding your pet from reality. He confirms that most will require all puppies to have at least one round of vaccines and parents sign a contract stating they won’t be around other dogs or go to dog parks. This ultimately helps keep the puppies healthy, while allowing them the benefits of socialization.\nAnother solution: You can safely take your dog everywhere you go.\nThat being said, if you are unable to find or afford puppy classes nearby, there is a homeschool option. Carefully permitting your pup to accompany you while traversing daily life will help accommodate them to various stimuli and everyday encounters. This will, in turn, minimize the risk of fear-based behavioral issues.\n“Whether or not you can find a puppy class near you, a new puppy parent should be taking their puppy everywhere and working on their puppy being neutral in new situations. Teaching your puppy to engage with you around other people and dogs will set you up for great success as they age,” DiBono says.",

    },
    "page_content": "Having a dog can be one of the best things in the world, but it can also be scary and downright frustrating at times. As parents, we all have a vision in mind of what we want our dogs to be like. We want them to listen, be well-behaved, and to exhibit the traits that we associate with a well-trained dog. But many dog parents struggle to get these goals conquered and often find themselves being frustrated with their dog’s behaviors, especially if these naughty behaviors take place in public. If this resonates with you, don’t worry. I see this a lot, you’re not alone, and it’s nothing to be ashamed of.\nThe problem is that we often approach our dogs’ behaviors from the wrong perspective. Instead of focusing on what we want our dogs to do, we focus on what we don’t want them to do. This is especially true when it comes to negative behaviors, such asjumping on people,pulling on the leash,barking, ordigging. Many try to stop their dogs’ choices by scolding them.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nThis study says it’s actually less about what’sintheir DNA and more about what’sonit.\nBut this approach is both ineffective and damaging. Punishing your dog for a behavior that you don’t like will only create fear and anxiety and will not address the underlying cause of the behavior — which could befear,anxiety, or confusion over what you’re asking them to do. In fact, by doing this, you can even make the behavior worse; your dog may start to associate the punishment with you, rather than with the behavior itself.\nChange the Way You’re Thinking\nFor us to succeed with training, we often need to reframe the way we think about our dogs’ behaviors. Instead of focusing on the negatives, we need to focus on the positives and the goal. We need to think about what we want our dogs to do and how we can reinforce that behavior. To repeat that one more time,reward the desired behavior you want and replace that behavior with the behavior you don’t want.\nTo do this, we need to understand our dogs’ motivations and behavior patterns. Often if we can identify what triggers the negative behavior, we can find a way to redirect that energy into a positive behavior. For example, if your dog barks when they see another dog, you can train them to sit and stay quiet at a distance as soon as they see the dog butbeforethey start to bark. You can then reward them withtreats, praise, and attention for exhibiting the desired behavior of sitting and staying quiet. Remember, it’s important you start this before the action of barking occurs.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nA big part of this is mental; once you master that, it will start to click and also change your frustration, which will help grow your bond. So, instead of getting mad or frustrated with your dog, think about what you would rather your dog be doing. Let’s go over a few examples:\nOriginal: My dog needs to stop jumping on friends who come over.New thinking: My dog should sit at the front door when people come over to be greeted.\nOriginal: I’m upset that my dog keepsgrabbing food off the counterswhen I’m cooking.New thinking: My dog needs to stay on the mat in the kitchen when I’m in there.\nRemember, Your Dog Is a Toddler\nThis might take a moment at first, and that’s OK. Another important aspect of reframing our mindsets as pet parents is to understand that setbacks and frustrations are a completely normal part of the training process. Training a dog is not a one-time event, but a continuous process of learning and growth together. Just like with any other skill, it takes time and patience for these new behaviors to become routine to our pet, but the more we reward the desired behaviors, the behaviors we don’t want to occur will happen less and less.\nDon’t forget: You’re pretty much dealing with a toddler. Although our dogs may be exceptionally talented in performing tricks or completing agility courses, their mental capacity is roughly equivalent to that of a two-to-five-year-old child. While we may value our dogs for their reliability, medical alertness, and communication abilities throughbuttons, we must keep in mind that their cognitive abilities are very similar to that of young kids. Therefore, we must make sure to set them up for success in various situations as we would a toddler.\nIt’s important to remember that dogs are individuals, so training isn’t one-size-fits-all.\nWould you let a three-year-old wander around a dinner party and expect that child to behave themselves? No, you wouldn’t. So, at that same dinner party you’d need to give your dog the skills to succeed, too. Maybe that’s being onleashwhen first meeting all the arriving guests or being tethered with astuffed Kongon adog bedright near me so they stay a bit occupied.\nWould you leave a toddler in the kitchen with a big chocolate cake within reach? Of course not. You also wouldn’t leave meat and tasty items that a dog finds valuable on the counter within reach of their paws or mouth. Instead, you are there to monitor your dog and reward them for staying in their designated “place.”\nReframing our mindset as dog parents is key to successful training. By focusing on the positives, understanding our dogs’ motivations and behavior patterns, and being patient with the process, we can create a deeper connection and relationship with our pups.",

    "page_content": "Giving a dog a treat as a reward is maybe the only thing most people know about dog training. And who doesn’t like a little treat? But positive-reinforcement dog training, as it’s called, isn’t as simple as that. If you want to teach yourdog commands, you need to understand reward-based training, so you don’t accidentally slow their progress by giving too many — or too few — treats.\nJust imagine you’re in Las Vegas playing a slot machine. Every time you deposit a quarter and pull the arm, you get your one quarter in return. Better than taking a big loss — but pretty boring. Soon, you’d probably lose interest and look for a more surprising machine. But the next machine takes your quarters and never, ever pays out. That would make for one bummer of a Vegas trip, but your bank account would be stoked.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nDogs don’t have bank accounts, but they do experience something like what you just imagined when facing these two extremes: continuous reinforcement — or none at all. That can lead to lower command compliance, or willingness to go along with your rules.\nHow to Use Positive Reinforcement to Train Your Dog\nTeach your dog new cued behaviors and make them more reliable by moving through this reward-frequency hierarchy. Here’s a quick breakdown of how you should use positive-reinforcement dog training — the right way — then dive into the details of how it works.\nInitially reward all successful trials to teach the behavior.\nInitially reward all successful trials to teach the behavior.\nRandomly reward successful trials to keep training interesting and improve command compliance.\nRandomly reward successful trials to keep training interesting and improve command compliance.\nBecome the referee who judges each trial and (randomly) reward only the absolute best performances.\nBecome the referee who judges each trial and (randomly) reward only the absolute best performances.\n“My dog will only sit if I have a treat,” mistaken pet parents often say. Over the years, I have heard this refrain many times, and it almost always means the dog was rewarded with treats for sitting on cue too often and for too long. Essentially, the dog had learned two things had to be true for them to comply: the sit cue plus atreat. If either were not true, they’d find something more interesting to do. Like stand up.\nWhen you begin teaching a new command, try “continuous reinforcement.” For instance, when first teaching a puppy to sit, it makes sense to reward them for every successful completion of the trick or “trial.” Your focus is on pairing the verbal cue and hand gesture with the behavior.\nHere are some simple steps to pry your pup away from thatonespot in the yard they’re obsessed with.\nAfter a while, though, that puppy will stop working so hard. Why bother sitting quickly, or at all, when a treat always comes? Continuous reinforcement will make the dog dependent on the food reward and they will refuse to work unless they get that dang treat. It doesn’t take long to get to that point either, usually just a few days after teaching a new command. That’s why you have to move to a less predictable reinforcement schedule ASAP.\nBack to the gambling analogy. Once you’re sure your dog has a grasp on what you’re teaching them, it’s time to become a fair and honest slot machine, dispensing small food rewards less frequently for successful trials.\nSide note: get yourself some soft treats that won’t crumble immediately into bits so you can keep them in your pocket.\nSlots entice folks to pump coins into machines for hours on end. The psychology behind this phenomenon is that the probability of winning remains constant, even though the number of plays it takes to recoup your money, or better yet, hit the jackpot, changes. The unpredictability makes doing the same mundane activity, over and over, interesting and exciting. You can take advantage of this same psychology to train your dog faster.\nWhen teaching your dog a new command, once you’ve determined that they know what you’re expecting from them, begin randomly rewarding successful trials using “Variable Ratio” positive reinforcement. Start with a low ratio, rewarding roughly one out of every three trials, then increase the ratio over the course of several training sessions.\nWell-trained dogs have more freedom (and more fun).\nFor example, when teaching your puppy to sit, provide a small treat for successful trials at intervals of 2, 7, 9, 15, 18, 19, 20, 23, and 25. Notice that during 25 trials, sometimes they get three rewards in a row, but sometimes, there’s a longer lag between treats. The idea is to keep them guessing — and working!\nOver the course of twice-daily training sessions of two to five minutes each, increase the ratio until they are rewarded for roughly one out of every ten successful trials. The behavior should become a happy habit by then, although, to keep commands fresh, continue to occasionally reward your dog for life. In other words, don’t become the slot machine that never pays a jackpot! And check your pockets for treats before putting them in the laundry.\nThere are other types of positive-reinforcement schedules too involved for our purposes here, but one to take advantage of is “differential deinforcement of excellent behavior,” or DRE. This is just a fancy way of saying “better performance earns bigger rewards.” Once you’ve worked through Continuous Reinforcement (treating every time to teach the command) and Variable Ratio (treating randomly to hone the behavior), you can polish the command by handsomely rewarding only the best trials.\nThe most mouth-watering treats for training your pup.\nDRE is especially useful for things like teachingrecalls. Once your dog is regularly responding to your “come” command, and you’ve worked through Variable Ratio reinforcement, start rewarding with higher-value treats, or more of what you have. Only do this when your dog immediately and enthusiastically answers your call. If they stop and smell the roses en-route, no reward is given.\nYou don’t have to be rigid while going through these steps, as some may be more useful at different times. And if you’removing too fast, it’s okay to take a step back. Your dog is not a bad dog because they need lessons to move more slowly.",

    "page_content": "There’s truly nothing better than a puppy. They’re small, sweet, cute, and pull focus in any photo.Butthey’re not so fun when they’re biting us. And if this is happening with your puppy, you’re not alone. We’ve all be there.A biting puppy isn’t the same thing as an aggressive puppy, which is a common misconception. (Yes, puppies can be aggressive, but 98 percent of the time I’ve found it’s not the case.) Puppies play and communicate with their mouths, and biting can also feel really good to them. Unfortunately, being on the receiving end of those little shark teeth doesn’t feelasgood to us.\nHonestly, this teething stage — along withpotty training— can be one of the most frustrating things about the adorable puppy months. So let’s go over how to minimize puppy biting right from the start.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHow to teach your pup to play nice.\nBasic Management\nI don’t let my puppies free-roam the house until they prove they won’t have an accident and won’t be chewing on household objects. If your pup is sneaking off and chewing on table legs and other items, it’s time to keep them tethered to you until this behavior stops.\nKeep a Toy Rotation\nBoredom is another cause of destructive chewing. Puppies are active by nature. Ensure you’re doing a mix of training and activity as well as providing a mix ofmental enrichment toysand games daily — plus some safe puppy playdates. I rotate the puppy-safe toys in my house to keep the dogs busy and prevent boredom from setting in. I’m a huge fan of stuffingKongswith kibble, goat’s milk, and other delicious goodies for them to chew on.\nPresent Them With an Appropriate Item\nWhen you catch your dog chewing on something they shouldn’t, like the furniture or perhapsyou, tell them “no” and get an appropriate item for them to chew. Make this item exciting; you can drag it on the ground, squeak it, or throw it.\nBut we should also keep an eye on what they’re chewing because there might be a reason why they’ve chosen that object. Maybe it feels good on their gums and new teeth. If that’s the case, make a trade for a similar-feeling object. If they’re chewing clothes or socks, I’ll get a soft toy or a soft tug toy.\nWhenever you are selecting a toy or something permissible for a puppy or an adult dog to play with or chew, consider the safety of their teeth. The enamel on dog’s teeth is much thinner than the enamel on human teeth and is therefore much more easily damaged. Always think to yourself, if you wouldn’t bite down on something, then neither should your dog. Choose rubberized toys or rope toys. Edible chews or chew toys need to be able to flex; if the item is too hard when the dog bites on it, it will sadly be the dog’s tooth that gets damaged, not the item. This also applies to sticks, stones, bones, and antlers, all of which are too hard and can cause teeth to fracture so supervision to ensure they don’t pick them up when out and about if essential.\nReward, Reward, Reward\nDon’t forget to reward correct chew choices. If they’re chewing an appropriate toy, either on their own or because I gave it to them, it’s important to tell them how good they are. Unfortunately, humans often overlook the positive-reinforcement aspect of chewing; remind yourself to praise good chewing behavior.\nWatch the Clock\nA puppy might also get mouthy when they’re tired or hungry. It just might be that it’s close to feeding time or that the puppy needs a nap. Pay attention to the times of day when this seems to happen, so that you can plan ahead. For example, do they always get excited and go crazy at 4 p.m.? If so, at 3:45 I would get out the fun toys or go for a walk and help them expel some of that energy in more acceptable ways. The more we make other play a good habit, the more predictable and harmonious our life with the puppy will be.\nHow We Play Matters\nWe should talk about play, too. Play is great and healthy for puppies and dogs of all ages. By making toys rewarding and fun, we can encourage play with appropriate objects. I always have some puppy-safe toys easily available to my puppies at all times.\nI’m also careful of my mannerisms when playing with puppies, especially mouthy ones. Avoid playing with your hands or letting your dog bite them during play. Even if the bites are gentle and playful, allowing any hand biting at all can confuse the puppy. You don’t want your puppy to grow up thinking they can bite someone’s hands, even for play. This could be harmful to small children or older people.\nDo they need to go outside?\nDo they need to go outside?\nAre they overly tired? Due for a nap?\nAre they overly tired?

The look on your dog’s face when you say, “Let’s go for a walk.” How they always know to come snuggle after a bad day. Or their full-bodied excitement as you open the front door. Hell, my dog can’t even stretch without me throwing her a full-on dance party — though, to be fair, we’re both pretty dramatic. But that initial year with a new pup is highlighted by firsts worthy of this level of reaction. To commemorate these moments, Pawness created apack of milestone cardsto help expecting dog moms and dads celebrate every new achievement.\nThe collection of 20 cards is perfect for curating a photo album of you and your pup’s first year together. Each design features a colorful announcement of that day’s event, such as “It’s my first time with the groomer” or “I lost my first puppy tooth!” For those of us who somehow managed to flunk arts and crafts, the very act of compiling such a photo album may sound daunting. Luckily, Pawness’s Milestone Cards were fabricated with the artistically challenged in mind. Documentation is as simple as holding the card next to your dog after a big moment and snapping a picture (just like your friends with kids do every time their babies elicit so much as a giggle).\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nNot only will this allow you to cherish these early days forever, it’ll also be something cute to look back on as a reminder of why the living room accidents and chewed shoes are absolutely worth it months down the line. Plus, for those who are more into journaling than scrapbooking, every card is dual-sided with writing prompts on the back side that describe each meaningful accomplishment.\nPawness starts with the basics by cataloging the day you bring your pet home, their three, six, and nine-month anniversaries, and their first birthday. Then, the milestone cards get into major outings: your puppy’s first grooming, vet visit, and training class. Finally, there are cards to celebrate your dog’s new tricks. This includes noting the day they learn to sit, give paw, and play fetch.\nAlso, the way Pawness creates and packages its products is as heartwarming as the milestone concept itself. Every card is composed of eco-friendly FSC-certified paper, meaning it was derived of responsibly-sourced wood fiber. The pouch they’re packed in is made entirely of organic cotton that’s certified by the Global Organic Textile Standard, an international group that confirms ethical worker, consumer, and environmental treatment throughout the production process.\nBut what would a doggie do-good brand be without some charitable give-back? Of course, Pawness doesn’t skimp in this area, either. For every purchase, Pawness donates 10 percent of its profits toPerro & Co, a Netherlands-based dog rescue. This group provides preventive healthcare aid to Portuguese shelters, as well as additional resources to help encourage and fund fosters and adoptions. There may not be a card to reflect it, but buying Pawness’ milestone cards would also mark your puppy’s first act of altruism.\nSustainable\nGives Back\nSmall Business\nWomen Owned",

Mixing your messages\nWhen you ask for relationship advice, any seasoned pro will tell you that communication is key. The same goes for your relationship with your pup. You may not speak the same language, but you can effectively communicate with your dog by being consistent. That means giving the same verbal cue every time. For example, if you’re teaching your dog recall, use “come” or “here” but not both; interchanging the commands will only confuse them.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nMaking sure the whole family is on board with the house rules is essential, too. If you allow your dog on the couch, but your partner doesn’t, your dog will never respect boundaries (and will probably play favorites). Also, do your best to stick to the same schedule on workdays and weekends — if they get special privileges on Sunday, they may act out on other days because they knowwhatthey’re missing but notwhy.\nWhen it’s time to call in reinforcements.\n2. Having stage-parent expectations\nYou went to one training class and taught yourdog to shakeand sit, so now they’re a gold medalist in your eyes. You might want to manage your expectations. Dogs need lots of repetition and practice in different settings to master new tricks. Get ready to spend at least the first two years working with your dog on core life skills because you’re playing the long game. And even after you’ve got basic obedience in the bag, regularly brush up on commands to avoid backslides andstrengthen the bondwith your dog.\n3. Ruling by fear\nIt’s safe to assume you want to be loved, not feared, by your pup. So, just so we’re on the same page, you already know you should never hurt or yell at your dog, right? Great. In terms of how you want to approach training, positive reinforcement trumps punishment-based methods in long-term studies. They key is rewarding your dog when they do somethinggood, not chastising them when they do somethingbad.\nRewards can betreats, praise, even playtime — whatever gets that tail going. Reinforcing that good behavior will give it staying power. When they do something bad, which they almost certainly will, redirect them to an appropriate activity. For example, if your puptreats your hand like a teether, immediately pull back and offer them a chew toy. Problem solved, and you won’t have to punish a puppy — which literally no one wants to do.\nThe idea of being a dog’s “alpha” is a popular one — but it’s not an effective way to train.\n4. Using the same cue over and over (and over)\nWhen you realize that your cues aren’t quite effective, it’s time to take a step back in the training process. Chances are your pup doesn’t understand what you’re asking, is too distracted, or has become a creature of habit and is waiting for your seventh “sit” to respond. Strip things down by only cueing your dog once,then wait a few seconds to see if they hop to it. (Dogs often need a few seconds to think — again, human language, not their forte.) If you want to speed things up, pair a word with the hand signal you’re teaching; body language is more in their wheelhouse. Remember, without consequence and context, your dog just hears words as sounds coming out of your face.\n5. Running marathon training sessions\nYou may have pulled many an all-nighter in school, but your dog isn’t studying for the bar exam and actually learns more in short spurts. Consider it a dog-training best practice to work on a few cues in two-to-five-minute sessions rather than going the distance — which can bring on frustration, boredom, and loss of focus. After all, it’s about positive associations, and you want to wrap up on a high note while your dog is still enjoying learning. Scheduling a few sessions per day will also force you to take breathers from work (which you keep telling yourself to do, anyway). On that note, remember that you’re training yourself as much as you’re training your dog, so if you find yourself losing patience, table it for another day. If you aren’t having fun, odds are your dog isn’t either.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\n6. Lining your dog’s path with temptation\nLet’s be honest, we areallthat person who chooses to order a salad but reaches across the table to eat a friend’s fries. So, expecting your dog to exert more self-control than you can muster is unreasonable. To them, food left out is an all-you-can-eat buffet, an open garbage can is a digging expedition, and shoes are justfunny looking chew toys. While you are working on training, it’s worth reminding yourself that human rules don’t make a lick of sense to a dog. Help themhelp youby managing their environment so they don’t bungle it.\n7. Thinking you know best\nProps for wanting to train your own dog! It’s an immersive way to learn about dog behavior and communication (while stoking the dog whisperer flame within). As devoted and determined as you are, there’s no shame in calling inreinforcements. If you’re taking two steps forward and three steps back, it’s time to hire a professional trainer, ideally ASAP before a minor bad habit turns into a major behavior issue. From potty training and leash walking toseparation anxietyand fear aggression, there’s no reason to go it alone.",

    "page_content": "It’s been three years (count ’em) since we were all told to stay inside our homes for an indefinite amount of time. During that excruciatingly confusing period, we told ourselves we loved to bake bread, do puzzles, and, most of all, that we were OK — insert always-relevant “this is fine” meme here. The one thing that was actually good about staying home for months on end was our dogs.\nWhen they realized we were never leaving, they rewarded us with extra snuggle time and lots of opportunities of taking photos of them sleeping like baby angels. But, now that many of us are back in the office and just generally living our lives because society demands it, our dogs are left to cope on their own, which results in, yes, you guessed it,separation anxiety. And my dog Emma definitely has a pretty serious case of it.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nDesperate to help Emma, I brought in multiple dog trainers, consulted four vets, cooked her food from scratch, gave her interactive food toys, and played calming music. I even hired a doggie masseuse. Results? Her separation anxiety only got worse: She didn’t stop barking, pacing, and peeing on the floor when I left. She even started chewing at my doorframe. Thankfully, there was a solution to my and Emma’s problem, and (a plus for your nervous pup) they didn’t include either of us having to leave the house.\nIt’s 2023, and the office is calling. How can our dogs cope?\nThe Shift Toward Online Dog Training\nMalena DeMartini — a California-based dog trainer and graduate of theAcademy for Dog Trainersunder the guidance of Jean Donaldson — has focused solely on separation-anxiety cases. Over time, she has become one of the leading experts (if nottheleading expert) on the condition. By using technology (smartphones, tablets, laptops, cameras), she is also transforming the way dogs, in general, are trained.\nDeMartini and the 20-plus separation-anxiety trainers she has certified do not work with clients in person. Instead, they do the job online: meet via apps such as Zoom or FaceTime and create and share spreadsheets so clients know exactly how to train their dogs each day. The team even reviews video footage with clients to teach them how to read their dogs’ body language. Training online also offsets the complication of bringing someone into the home when the goal is to help the dog handle timealone.\nDeMartini began offering onlineseparation-anxietytraining in 2008, saving her time and energy and, more importantly, allowing her to observe a dog in real time. Rather than review what went on after the fact, she could modify the training protocol online as the behavior was in progress.\nTrain your dog to stay calm when they’re on their own — instead of sad-singing“All By Myself”until you come home.\nCreating an Individualized Separation Anxiety Plan\nWorking with one of DeMartini’s trainers, Caryn Liles, who lives in Toronto, we began our online training sessions. I stacked books on a chair facing the front door and set my MacBook on top while Liles observed Emma while I went for a walk outside. The tiny pup had a threshold of 10 seconds — meaning Emma could only handle being alone in the house for 10 seconds. That was our starting point.\nUntil completing the separation-anxiety protocol, Emma could only be left alone in the house during her training sessions. “The first goal is to teach the dog, ‘Hey, you know what? You’re okay for a full second of being left alone, or three seconds,’” DeMartini says. And once they get to that point, they’re like, ‘The sky didn’t fall! Amazing!’” The training wouldn’t work if, for example, their pet parent then drove away and caught a two-hour movie. Note: When we do want to catch a movie or go out to dinner, my husband and I have recruited friends and pet sitters to keep Emma company. (For dogs who enjoy spending time with other pups,doggie daycarecan be a great option; unfortunately, Emma’s not a fan.)\nThe morning following that assessment meeting, Liles sent me a Google Sheet titled “Mission One,” a series of 12 exercises that started with the following:\nOpen front door one inch, close it, return.\nOpen front door one inch, close it, return.\nStand outside the front door for one second, return.\nStand outside the front door for one second, return.\nOpen the door one inch, close it, return.\nOpen the door one inch, close it, return.\nStand outside for one second, return.\nStand outside for one second, return.\nTurn door handle, return.\nTurn door handle, return.\nWe asked both animal behaviorists and human psychologists howyoucan deal with leaving your dog home alone.\nAt the start of each exercise, I grabbed my keys and purse from the kitchen and then put them back upon my return. I was instructed to wait 60 to 90 seconds between each exercise, at which point I would type into the spreadsheet a description of Emma’s behavior during my absence and what her recovery looked like.\nWhile outside, I watch Emma on my iPhone through a camera mounted above the fireplace. If you have multiple smartphones or tablets, another option is to use an app that turns one device into a video camera and allows you to watch on another.\nMaking Quick Progress\nEach day, Liles reviews the previous mission and then creates a new one based on the results. We repeated Mission One for seven days before graduating tofive whole secondsout the door on Mission Two.\n“I teach a dog to be relaxed in incredibly small increments,” DeMartini says about her training protocol. “People initially have a sort of pushback, if you will, like, ‘Oh, my gosh, we’re starting with one second? What? This is crazy! It’s gonna be the year 2037 before I ever leave my dog!’”\nThankfully, it doesn’t take a decade for most dogs to be desensitized to being alone, thoughsome dogs need medicationto help them relax enough to succeed, and some, unfortunately, can never get past theirfear. Most of DeMartini’s clients complete training somewhere in the three-to six-month range (meaning the dog can handle being alone for four or five hours). But DeMartini hesitates to give time estimates. Each dog is different, and anxiety level does not necessarily predict speed.\nIt was a trick question. A study shows that the pandemic has made us all codependent.\nTraining Emma on her separation-anxiety fears is also improving her fears in other areas, too. By not losing it every time the front door creaks open, Emma has gained confidence overall. She no longer cocks an ear and furrows her brow when a construction crew bangs outside or televised gunshots ring out in surround sound. And rather thanshake in terror in the car, Emma now puts her nose up to the window opening. When I glance over at Emma, flopped on her side napping peacefully in a sun patch on the rug, I know that we’re making progress.",

    },
    "page_content": "In my time as a trainer, I’ve seen dogs who give their pet-parent constant attention, dogs who couldn’t seem to care less, and dogs who learned over time to focus in on their guardian on cue. A pup’s focus is unpredictable: Some naturally attentive dogs are clingy and some are social butterflies who are just drawn to people. Still others are a bitpossessive, treating their guardians as though they are the best bones in the world and need constant attention to maintain their safety. While these traits can be modified, they cannot be created out of thin air or fundamentally changed. Dogs either have this behavioral tendency or they don’t.\nFew dogs are as naturally attentive as most of us wish; if yours isn’t, don’t feel bad or wonder what you did wrong. Your dog, like most dogs, just isn’t built that way. For some guardians, that’s a good thing. Plenty of people prefer pups with their own interests who can amuse themselves and aren’t staring at them expectantly, waiting to be entertained. But it’s important to be able to get your dog’s attention, too. Luckily, even inattentive pups can learn to respond to cues.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nBuilding Stronger Relationships\nThe strength of your relationship has an impact on your dog’s attentiveness. If you have consistently been a source of what makes your dog happy, attention is a likely side effect. If you have a love between the two of you and a strong history of fun together, your dog might be more likely to feel motivated to pay attention to you in any given moment.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nWhile a good relationship can help with attention issues, it won’t necessarily guarantee a high level of attentiveness. It won’t. It’s just one piece of the puzzle, and if your dog is not highly attentive in all situations, it certainly doesn’t mean that the relationship is flawed or in any way lacking. It just means that, for whatever reason, your dog is focusing on other aspects of the environment.\nMany people find that their dogs are so engrossed in what’s around them and all its wonderfulsmellsthat getting them to pay attention outdoors feels like swimming upstream. Though such “nose to the ground” dogs are indeed among the most challenging when it comes to working on attentiveness, many of them are actually paying attention to their people without obvious signs of doing so. It’s common for those with dogs who are particularly responsive to the environment to note that their dogs always know where they are when they’re out and about. But the dogs’ top priority in that context isn’t interacting with people; it’s interacting with the environment. They tend to show their affiliation in other ways at other times, and that’s where the strength of the relationship is more obvious to the casual observer.\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nMany factors affect your relationship, including your respective personalities and your interactions over time. If your dog associates you withtreats, enjoyable training,massages, outings,toys,and games, you’re more likely to have their attention. In the best of relationships, there’s also an intangible quality: some individuals hit it off in an indefinable, magical way.Strong bonds of loveare often made of those special and inexplicable connections. If a relationship is damaged or not very strong, the dog may give more attention to someone else.\nPutting Attention On Cue\n“My dog pays me no mind when they’re outside off leash.” “My dog is always blowing me off.” “They know they’re supposed to listen to me, but they ignore me if anything else is going on.” These are all common complaints from people struggling with getting their dogs to pay attention on cue.\nThe problem many of us have with adog who is not responsive to cues, especially outside, is not so much a matter of devotion but of training. For most dogs, learning a “pay attention” cue in the face of a whole world of wonder is essentially a difficult, high-level trick and must be taught as such. Yes, some dogs learn this quickly and thoroughly without too much trouble, but that’s unusual. For most dogs, expect top-quality responses only after consistent, long-term training efforts.\nIn the larger scheme of things, a cue to pay attention is essential because it is the basis of all training. You can teach a dog just about anything if you have their attention, but it’s virtually impossible if you don’t. Asking for a dog’s attention is a top priority for professional trainers, which is why it is often the first skill taught in classes or private lessons.\nWhen it’s time to call in reinforcements.\nThis is especially valuable for dogs who don’t frequently offer their attention spontaneously. Teaching dogs to give attention when they don’t consistently offer it on their own requires more time and effort because you have to teach the behavior and associate it with a cue.\nEffective Attention Training Behaviors\nThe two most common cues for attention are “watch” and the dog’s name. “Watch” tells a dog to look at your face, and it’s a great way to keep a dog from paying attention to things that cause them to act in an undesirable way. Saying the dog’s name lets them know that they should pay attention to you and wait for more information.\nOnce you have your dog’s attention, it’s easier for them to respond to other cues, including “down,” “stay” and “come,” or simply to follow you in a new direction on a walk. It’s important to reinforce these behaviors so your dog’s glad they did what you asked. If they learn that they’ll receive atreator have a chance to play for giving you their attention in response to the cue “watch” or to their name, they will be more likely to give you their attention when asked in the future.\nIf your dog tries to scarf down literally everything in sight, youneedthis advice.\nPaying attention will be easier for your dog in some contexts than in others. Typically, dogs are more likely to pay attention inside than outside, and when there are no distractions — no squirrels or smells of food or other interesting things in the air. Like any other skill, giving attention on cue requires practice and takes time to teach. Gradually working toward giving attention in increasingly challenging environments is a good strategy. Improving the relationship so that the dog is more inclined to pay attention will also improve your dog’s responsiveness to you.\nMore Trainer Tricks\nIdeally, dogs keep track of where their human is. It’s a sign of maturity to be able to sniff in the grass, romp with a canine buddy, and still occasionally check in. Although dogs with certain natural tendencies are more likely to do this, others can be trained to act the same way.\nWhen I’m teaching dogs to exhibit this behavior, I do it in places that allow them to be safelyoff leash, where they can wander and sniff to their hearts’ content. When the dog is in their own world and not attending to me at all, I position myself so that I can see the dog, but they can’t see me. When they look up and seem just a little concerned, I call them to come, reinforcing them for their successful search. (If the dog becomes stressed, I come out of my hiding spot so they can see me and still reinforce them for coming to me.)\nThe most mouth-watering treats for training your pup.\nThis is a good way to perfect recalls and teach your dog that it’s wise to keep track of you, but it only works with dogs who are connected enough to care when they think for a moment that their human is lost. It is not helpful with aloof dogs or those who are completely unperturbed by your absence, and it’s just cruel to disappear on a clingy, nervous dog. Reserve this technique for those who are stable enough to handle your absence and connected enough to care — which, fortunately, is the majority of dogs.\nRemember, when we talk about our dogs paying attention to us, we are really talking about two things: spontaneous attention and attention given on cue. There are many ways to improve both kinds of attentiveness, but that doesn’t mean you can change a dog’s essential nature. All the training in the world isn’t going to turn an aloof and independent dog or a dog who is wildly distracted by the smells of the great outdoors into one who is compulsive about checking in. But it is possible to teach any dog to respond properly to the cue “watch” and to their name and to come when called.\nIt’s also possible, and desirable, to strengthen your relationship with your dog to increase their attentiveness to you. The more fun and satisfying your interactions are, the more likely your dog is to give you their attention spontaneously or on cue.",

    },
    "page_content": "Therapy animals make the world a better place. I know that firsthand. I’ve done a lot of therapy-dog visits with my dog Maggie. We’ve even traveled to other states to volunteer. I can honestly say those were some of our favorite times together. But as a dog trainer, I see a lot of miscommunication and misunderstanding about exactly what a therapy dog is — and how exactly they can help people.\nSo, what is a therapy dog and where can you bring yours?\nTherapy-dog work is a commitment for both the dog and the handler. Not every dog would enjoy being a therapy dog, just like not every dog wants to participate inagilityor sheepherding. But if your dog loves attention and affection, and they can remain calm with new people in unfamiliar surroundings, therapy work may be something you’d be interested in doing together.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nHere are some places — or scenarios — where you might consider bringing your therapy dog.\nConfused about ESA rules? Here’s a comprehensive guide that explains everything.\nThe best-known venues for therapy dogs are hospitals and nursing homes, many of which have long-standing programs for therapy animals. To a dog, though, these two institutions can represent very different working environments. At hospitals, you generally go from room to room, visiting patients who’d like to get a visit from a therapy animal. In nursing homes, you might stay in common areas greeting the residents, though some will have you go room to room. Dogs usually work for one to two hours in a session; this is a lot, and your dog will be exhausted from all the meeting and greeting.\nIn recent years, there’s been much interest in bringing therapy animals to a variety of settings to help people relax and de-stress.Airports, for example, have been attempting to alleviate the stress of travel by hosting therapy dogs to socialize with travelers who missed their flights, have been slapped with a long delay, or just need some extra love on a long day as they get from A to B.\nTherapy dogs are also brought in after tragedies, such as natural disasters, school shootings, or accidents that result in fatalities. Dogs provide healing and comfort in these difficult times and can help ease the pain of loss. As Kinship covered last fall, therapy dogs came to Uvalde, Texas to comfort students in the town, following the deadly shooting at Robb Elementary last May.\nHow Golden Retrievers are helping Uvalde, TX, students return to class after the May 2022 tragedy.\n“It’s an amazing transformation of children sometimes,” Dr. Thomas Demaria, PhD, a consultant for the National Center for School crisis and Bereavement, told Kinship at the time. “What’s scary is the violence is perpetrated by a human person. Animals — especially dogs — have the capacity to approach children in a safe, comforting way, where they don’t feel alone anymore.”\nOne of the more interesting places I’ve worked with my dog Maggie was at a safe house for women and children. We went to the group therapy session with the kids. They got to pet Maggie, and I was asked to share stories about Maggie and me that they could relate to. I told them how Maggie doesn’t just bite someone if she’s mad; instead, she may growl or walk away. Many of these kids had never had a dog, had never touched a dog or been kissed by a dog. We all got to learn together, and it was a really special and emotional time each week.\nSchools will engage therapy dogs to support children with social and emotional learning. Studies have shown that having therapy animals results in increased attendance, improved problem solving, and lowered stress levels. Therapy dogs also take part in reading programs, where the company of a dog — a non-judgmental friend — has shown toincrease reading skillsby about 12 percent.\nTherapy dogs are also having their day in court. Child witnesses are often very nervous about speaking in court; the presence of therapy dogs can ease their fears. Check outCourthouse Dogs Foundationfor more info on why these dogs are often helpful in these spaces.\nIf you’re interested in a certain type of therapy work, consider reaching out to a facility near you and asking if they work with a specific part of the therapy-dog community. Just a note that hospitals often partner with a therapy service, and you’ll have to register with that service (and meet their requirements) to volunteer at that hospital.\nTherapy dogs are not service dogs or ESAs.\nIt’s also important to keep in mind that therapy dogs are not the same as other types of service dogs. Therapy dogs have the job of giving comfort to others, which often involves remaining calm while being petted and loved on. These dogs are very well-behaved and trained. I’ve seen therapy dogs make such a difference for people. I’ve watched as they help patients who haven’t spoken in weeks (suddenly they start sharing stories about their past dog!).\nThe short answer: No animal registration is required, but service dogs still need to be properly trained.\nTherapy dogs are different fromservicedogs; they don’t have public access rights, which means a therapy dog can’t go to a restaurant, a hotel or other non-pet friendly establishments, unless they’re on an official therapy visit. Unlike a service dog, therapy dogs aren’t protected under theAmericans with Disabilities Act(ADA).\nThere’s another category of therapeutic pet called emotional support animals (ESAs). These animals are not required to have any special training; they are simply supportive to their owners by being there as a companion. Like therapy dogs, ESAa don’t have public access rights to non-pet friendly establishments. When working with your therapy dog, it’s important to know your (and your dog’s) rights when it comes to where you can bring them and with whom they can work. Here ismore informationon therapy dogs under the ADA.\nRegardless of how (and where) you work with therapy dogs, I know you’ll find it rewarding, and well, therapeutic.",

    "page_content": "The game of fetch wins the prize as the ultimate good-for-us, good-for-them activity. It gives dogs exercise without us having to work up a sweat, and it’s a great way to teach dogs the crucial skill of dropping an object on cue. Since it’s fun and interactive, it enhances the relationship between us and our pups.\nSome dogs are naturally good at fetch (and some will even play it by themselves). All you have to do is find a likely object (a ball, a stick, a pine cone), throw it, and enjoy the fun of a good game with your dog. If you have one of these dogs, you can give them lots of exercise and they will, quite literally, consider you the best game in town. For the rest of us, there are ways to teach a dog to fetch so that you can both enjoy playing it. Many dogs who aren’t naturals at the game love to fetch once someone has taught them how to play.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nStep by Step: How to Teach Your Dog to Fetch\nTo make it as likely as possible for your dog to take an interest in the game of fetch, begin teaching them inside the house. I know, I know, playing fetch in the house seems crazy, but it’s only temporary. Eventually, you’ll be playing outside — but by starting indoors where there are fewer distractions, it’s easier for your dog to focus. (For the sake of simplicity, I’m going to use the word “ball,” but fetch can be played with any toy your dog finds appealing.)\nBounce it a couple of times, toss it in the air and catch it, or wave it around. It’s often the movement rather than the toy itself that dogs find attractive, so get that ball moving.\nGo beyond the basics.\nToss no more than five feet away from you and your dog. If your dog heads in the direction of the ball and picks it up, clap gently and head in the other direction. Most dogs love a chase game, and your movement is likely to entice them to follow you. Resist the urge to call them to come or to say their name, which will make many dogs drop the ball and trot to the person calling them. If they come partway to you and then drop the ball, keep clapping and moving away from them. Consider it an unbreakable rule that they move toward you and you donotmove toward them.\nAlways run in the opposite direction. Dogs can rarely resist a chase game, and it’s up to you to be the chase-ee rather than the chaser. This isn’t easy, but making a conscious effort not to give in and chase your dog will pay off in the long run.\nMost of us tend to pick up the ball and hold it while we praise our dog or pet her, but this isn’t the time for that. We think we’re playing fetch, but our dogs think we’re hoarding the ball. They want the ball back, and they want it now. Since we’re trying to make sure they love the game of fetch, we need to make it as fun as possible for them, and that means letting them have the ball, not holding on to it.\nSo, toss the ball the instant your dog drops it. This sounds simple, but over the years, I’ve found it to be the aspect of fetch that many people struggle with the most. Think of throwing the ball the second you get your hands on it as a challenge you give yourself. You win if you toss it right away; you lose if you hold onto it.\nA few minutes — or even a few steps — are all you need to add joy to your dog’s day.\nFetch Challenges And How To Fix Them\nIf you are having trouble teaching your dog to fetch, here are a few fixes for common fetch problems:\nNot all dogs are interested in the retrieving part of fetch. They like the part where they chase the ball, but picking it up and carrying it anywhere is not nearly as appealing. One way to encourage a dog to bring something back to you is to choose the toy that your dog finds most interesting. That’s often a ball, but it could also be a rope, a stuffed animal, or a Frisbee.\nIdeally, choose a toy that you and your dog can play with interactively. So, if your dog likes to tug, play with their favorite tug toy, then toss it a foot or two away. If they bring it back, resume the game of tug for a bit before tossing it again. Once your dog is really good at bringing the tug toy back to you, you won’t need to play tug after every retrieve, but doing so occasionally is a great way to maintain their interest in fetching. If your dog likes you to squeak a fleece toy as you play with them, make it squeak, then toss it and squeak it again if they pick it up and bring it to you.\nSome dogs prefer to pick up food, so if you can make the toy smell like food, they may pick it up. Soak a ball in some chicken soup or rub a little bit ofpeanut butteron it and see if that piques their interest. If they bring it to you, put a bit more food on it and toss it a few feet away. They may think of this game as an “active dinner,” but it’s a form of fetch that teaches them to follow a toy, pick it up, and bring it back to you. I have known quite a few dogs who began to fetch this way and learned to like more standard fetch games that didn’t involve food.\nKinshipCollective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a stubborn pup to listen up.\nMany dogs are so excited about the ball that they don’t want to give it up. One way to convince these dogs to let go of the ball is to put atreatright under their nose, which will prompt most dogs to release the ball to eat the treat. If you do this, throw the ball again immediately so that the focus returns to the game. Having a dog who drops the ball in response to a treat may not be what you have in mind, but it’s a way to teach them to drop the ball in response to a cue.\nOnce your dog reliably drops the ball when a treat is put under their nose, add in a cue. Say “Drop it,” then put the treat under their nose, giving it to them once they release the ball. With repetition, dogs learn to drop the ball when you give the cue, and you can gradually decrease the use of treats. Throwing the ball again is also a reinforcement for dropping the ball, and it’s often the case that continuing the game is worth more to dogs than treats.\nHowever, some dogs are so distracted by treats that it’s hard to resume a fetch game if treats are around. This problem can be resolved by using multiple balls. As soon as your dog comes near you while holding the ball, throw another ball; it may help to bounce it or toss it in the air a few times first. Most dogs will chase the moving ball and let go of the one in their mouth to pick up the new one.\n(When you use multiple balls, your dog may drop them all over the place, especially at first, so you might be doing some fetching yourself. But once dropping a ball to go after another one becomes a habit for them, they’re more likely to drop it near you, so the extra exercise should only be temporary.)\nThe most mouth-watering treats for training your pup.\nAt first, many dogs will quickly lose interest in the game. If you want your dog to play fetch longer, there are ways to make that happen. For example, dogs will often give it more time when playing inside, where there are fewer distractions (especially smells!). Even if you eventually want to play outside, increasing the length of indoor sessions will help you achieve that goal.\nAnother strategy is to stop fetch sessions before they give up on them. That leaves them wanting more, which will make them more likely to fetch longer in the future. Pay attention to patterns: if they regularly fetch four times before losing interest, only throw the ball three times during your next few games. Then, gradually increase the number of throws — four or five, then six or seven, and so on.\nMaking the game more exciting is another great way to expand the length of time you can keep your dog interested in the game. There are many ways to do that. Here are a few:\nRun away when they’re bringing the ball back to you, which makes many dogs more enthusiastic about playing.\nRun away when they’re bringing the ball back to you, which makes many dogs more enthusiastic about playing.\nTry to play during the part of the day when they’re the peppiest and most energetic.

Being chased is endlessly fun for dogs, but if you start chasing her, you will be doing so endlessly. Stick to the rules of fetch — your dogmoves toward you, you do not move toward your dog.\nPlay fetch with multiple toys and throw them in unpredictable directions, so they don’t know which way to run until you throw. If they do not chase the object and continue to run away from you in random directions, stop the game and try again later. Stopping the game is a way to teach them that if they run away from you in an attempt to initiate a game of chase, playtime ends.\nSome dogs aretooenthusiastic about fetch, and don’t take it well when the game ends. One of the best ways to handle this is to teach your dog that when you say, “one more,” you will only throw the ball a final time. Communicating the intent to end the game helps many dogs cope because they are not caught off guard.\nWith some dogs, you can let them keep the ball after the last toss, but if your dog keeps putting the ball at your feet and waiting for a throw you don’t intend to make, it’s best to pick it up and put it away when the game is over. Another way to ease end-of-the-game pain is to follow it with something else your dog likes, such as a training session, awalk, or amassage.\nIf your dog learns that the end of fetch isnotthe end of happy times with you, it becomes easier for them to accept that the ball will not be thrown again right now. Adding an activity after fetch may not be easy to fit into your schedule, but if you can commit the time, it’s a great option.\nIf your dog loses their sh*t over anything—from a squirrel to a guest. Here are some tips to curtail that.\nDogs who struggle with emotional control can sometimes get nippy while playing fetch. The out-of-control behavior is generally all about arousal, and that should be addressed in order for fetch to be fun for both of you. Dogs need to develop and practice self-control to be able to play appropriately, and it’s easier for them to do that if we work onlowering the arousallevel.\nIt’s normal to contribute to the fun of fetch by acting upbeat and goofy. That may mean saying, “Here you go! Good dog!” and then throwing the ball, clapping, running away, and offering enthusiastic praise. But if your dog gets too revved up to control their body and their mouth, do none of that. Instead, calmly toss the toy a short distance away, then say “Goooood” in soothing tones when they return it to you.\nYou can gradually work up to playing fetch with greater amounts of energy and excitement and joy, but start in low-arousal mode. If a particular type of toy excites your dog, avoid it and use ones without such a pepping-up effect. Commonly, that means starting with a stuffed toy rather than a ball, although for some dogs, a ball is fine but a Frisbee makes them go nuts.\nTo control arousal, pause while playing. Every two, three, or four throws, ask them to do something — a sit-pretty, a down, or a stay are all good candidates. Doing almost any behavior or trick they know how to do on cue can have a calming effect. (The exception is “spin,” which I’ve found revs up so many dogs that I don’t ask for it in this context.)\nAlso, I always like to do at least two throws. It’s not that I would never do just one if things seemed to be getting out of hand, but as a rule, I try to do at least two to get that turnover so that the fun stays in the game. If the pauses aren’t enough to control the arousal and they are just too mouthy, stop the game and redirect them to another activity — a walk, a bone to chew, or a training session.\nChase? Wrestle? Tug-o-war? Find out which are fair game.\nSome dogs show no interest in fetch and don’t respond to the most common ways to get the game going. If your dog is like this, don’t despair. Many dogs start out with little interest in or understanding of retrieving, but come to enjoy it through the use of a treat-stuffed toy.\nMake the food relatively difficult to extract, toss the toy just a few feet, then take the toy away from them, remove some treats and give the treats to them. Once they learn that the fastest way to get the treats is to bring the toy to you, they are technically retrieving. The next step is to take the toy from them when they head your way but give them treats from your pocket rather than from the toy. Eventually, you won’t even need to stuff the toy. You’ll be able to toss the toy and then offer treats when your dog brings it back to you.\nAnother option is to teach a dog to fetch as a trick by using shaping, which is reinforcing successive approximations of the behavior that you eventually want. With fetch, that means you’ll begin by offering your dog treats for showing any interest in the toy. For some dogs, “interest” may be poking at it with their nose, but for others, it may be walking toward the toy or even just looking at it. Once the dog learns that this initial behavior earns treats, you require the dog to do more to earn them.\nThe series of steps may include touching the ball or toy, nudging it, taking it in their mouth, picking it up, walking a step with it, taking it in your general direction, taking it part-way to you, bringing it all the way to you, and dropping it. Some dogs who learn to play fetch this way grow to love it and want to play the game. A caveat: while some dogs will happily do it as a trick, they won’t necessarily develop a great love of fetching for fetching’s sake.\nCue theSchoolhouse Rock!because learning can be fun.\nTeaching Your Dog Fetch Requires Patience\nTo achieve the goal of happy games of fetch with your dog, be open-minded about how to teach it and choose the methods that best suit your particular dog. Help them succeed by moving away from them to encourage them to come to you, reinforce anything that approximates fetch as they begin to learn to play, and resist their attempts to teach you to play “chase the dog around the yard.” Have fun, and play ball!",

Outside of being adorable, teaching your dog to spin in a circle, dance, give high fives, and so much more can actually have a purpose in training.\nSome of my clients think it‘s silly when I suggest we teach their dogs a few “tricks.” After all, they just want a confident, happy dog; they don’t need Fido skateboarding and doing handstands (by the way, these are all tricks my dog can do). In the end, these pet parents are surprised at how often their dogs can use these tricks in everyday life — and they want them to learn more. So, why is it important that your dog can master more than the basic cues of “sit,” “come,” and “stay?”\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nTrick training increases their focus and gives your relationship a boost.\nA learned trick can help dogs become more confident in exploring new areas, in uncertain situations, or when they may be too excited. Often, when dogs become nervous, they get frozen and stuck. By reinforcing a familiar trick, we get their feet and their brains moving and working.\nFor example, if a dog is overly focused on another dog, before theybark, I would ask for a “touch” or “watch” and reward that. This diverts their attention to the cue instead of the other dog. Here are three easy tricks I teach dogs of all ages; you can teach them to your dog, too. Get yourtreatsready.\nTouch\nStart by placing your hand — palm facing your dog — just a few centimeters from your dog’s nose. They will naturally want to sniff and, perhaps, touch your hand. When they do, say “good” and give a reward. Repeat this a few times over the next few days. Once your dog gets this down, it’s time to make it harder. Start by placing your hand to the side of their face and reward when they touch.\n5 reasons to get your dog in the agility game, from burning energy to building confidence.\nIf your dog paws, licks, or shakes your hand, just simply remove your hand and try again. This is called “offering.” Your dog is offering other behaviors to see if that may get them the treat. Don’t reward these behaviors. Once your dog is touching each time, begin to say, “touch” when you present your hand and then slowly move your hand further away from your dog. Soon, your dog will be running across the room to “touch.”\nSpin in a Circle\nI love teaching this to dogs; it’s good for them and loosens up their body as they spin and twirl around. Take your treat, and at nose height, lure your dog, having them follow the treat, in a circle. Once your dog completes the circle, give them the treat. If your dog is not doing a full circle, break it into smaller sections: Reward them even when they start to do the circle. If your dog is jumping up for that treat, your treat is too high; be sure to keep it at the same level as your dog’s nose.\nShake a Paw\nA classic. Put a treat in a closed fist and present it to your dog, leave your hand there and be patient. If they lick your hand, just ignore them. If they paw at your hand, give them a treat. Repeat this a few times. When your pup first touches your hand, be sure to reward them right away. Next, try switching to an open hand — palm up — and see if they offer that same paw! You’ll be shaking paws sooner than you know it.\nUh, who else gotthatmemo?\nI hope this helps you and your dog get started on trick training and gives you new tools to use in your life together. Get ready to show off some new (and literal) party tricks at your next pup-parent gathering.",

    },
    "page_content": "Sure, there’s something undeniably adorable about a mischievous pup. For those of us who work with dogs, we’re used to hearing stories of misbehavior told with a hint of glee. People love to share the ways their “little rascal” is so clever and impish — misbehaving in the most lovable and endearing ways. But as sweet as they may sound, what these tales really do is glorify a dog’s complete lack of boundaries.\nAlthough the occasional story of a dog running amuck can be entertaining, I reject the idea that this is how dogsshouldbe — wild, free, and unencumbered by constraints on their desires and inclinations. In fact, I would argue that by setting boundaries through training, weenhance our dog’s happiness. Here are a few advantages your trained dog will get to enjoy.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nMore off-leash opportunities.\nOff-leash dogs can run full speed, explore, sniff as long as they wish at an interesting spot, and make their own choices. Few other activities offer dogs such a quality experience. But not all dogs can handle being unleashed; some run off, get lost, go into the road or accost others.\nKinshipCollective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a stubborn pup to listen up.\nDogs who come when called, don’t cross boundaries, and are polite and well-mannered can be safely given the freedom to be off-leash in wide open spaces, such ason hikesor in fields. For dogs without such skills, off-leash opportunities may only be availablein their backyardorat the dog park. That means they probably don’t get to be off-leash as often or for as long as well-trained dogs.\nWelcome in more public places.\nA well-behaved dog who knows how to walk nicely on-leash andgreet people politelywill be welcome at dog-friendly businesses such as coffee shops and retail stores. So, rather than stay at home, your dog can accompany you on errands and outings to such places. Well-mannered dogs have a fuller life with more varied experiences.\nExpert advice for people with dogs who jump, bark, and generally go nuts when people come over.\nWelcome to attend social events and co-pilot on trips.\nA dog with training in basic manners is far more likely to be welcome at social events — from a two-hour book club meeting to a week-long family gathering. “Basic manners” include the capacity to sit, stay, leave it, wait at the door, come,walk nicely on-leash, drop it, greet politely and stop barking on cue. That may seem like a long list, but mastering these behaviors makes dogs so much more pleasant to be around, and that translates to an enjoyable visit for everyone.\nIf your pup acts diabolical on walks, you are not alone. Here’s what you can do.\nThere’s also a bonus benefit: It’s easier to find someone willing to watch your dog in their home when you need to go out of town without them. While many dogs are perfectly happy in the kennel, a lot aren’t. You’re far more likely to have the option of a friend or neighbor taking in your dog if they’re trained. Here again, rather than being left at home or put in the back room when company comes, dogs with proper boundaries are allowed to socialize and enjoy the festivities.\nMore play dates with other dogs.\nDogs with good social skills who don’t leap on people, dig in gardens, or run around like unguided missiles are able to have play dates with a variety of dogs. It’s a shame when dogs miss out on the fun because they haven’t had enough training to be able to act appropriately.\nBetter relationships with their human family.\nThe core ofour bond with dogsis the development of a strong relationship. Clearly, while it’s possible to be head-over-heels in love with a dog even if they’re impish, such behavior has damaged many a union. It may not ruin the relationship if your dog eats your wedding ring or plants their muddy paws on your new dress, but it doesn’t help it, either.\nWhat to do when your best-laid training plans are sabotaged.\nMore walks.\nMany dogs are hard to walk because they pull relentlessly, cut in front of people,bark at everything they see, or wrap their leashes around trees and mailboxes as they move chaotically along. Often, this means these dogs aren’t walked as frequently as trained dogs because the behaviors are unpleasant for their people. A shortage of walks may, in turn, make the dog’s behavior worse when they do go out because they’re overexcited and overly energetic.\nIf your dog loses their sh*t over anything—from a squirrel to a guest. Here are some tips to curtail that.\nIf dogs practice walking and are specifically trained to have nice leash manners, it’s more fun and easy to take them on walks. That means their owners will take them out even if the weather is bad, if they’ve had a tiring work day, or if some other reason makes a walk unappealing.\nAlso, if your dog is well-trained enough to make walking them a pleasant experience, friends will likely agree to do it if you can’t for some reason (for example, a work emergency, an out-of-town trip, a sprained ankle).\nThe final takeaway.\nMany people find a hilariously out-of-control dog amusing to read about or to watch from time to time. But sadly, such dogs are rarely allowed the same amount of fun as dogs who have parents who put in the training time. Boundaries and training don’t impinge on a dog’s freedom — they enhance it.",

So why not apply that theory to training your new dog?\nRead on for five house rules you can teach your new pet in their first month home. No pressure, though. Every dog is different, and yours might need more time to hit their milestones.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThe crate is their happy place.\n“To crate or not to crate” is a question that many new dog parents ponder. Try to see your pup’s crate more as a cozy den than a panic room. If your dog is a rescue, it likely found refuge in a compact, sheltered space at some point in their past life, and they might associate it with trauma. You want your dog to love their crate, and there are a few ways to make that happen. From day one, randomly toss treats and toys into the crate and watch as your pup goes fishing for them. Do the same with bones and food-stuffed toys to encourage them to stay a while. In time, they will associate the crate with good things.\nDogs thrive on routine. Schedule crate time so it’s predictable for your pup. Even if you plan on phasing out the crate once your dog is potty trained, it can’t hurt to make them comfortable in there overnight, when you’re out, and when you just need some downtime. This is for your dog’s safety as much as it is for your stuff — teething puppies and untrained dogs can chew and choke on objects when you’re not around to supervise. And you’d probably prefernotto wake to pee puddles near your bed.\nException to the rule: dogs who struggle with confinement anxiety should not be crated. Barking and whining for a few minutes is to be expected, but if your dog perpetually howls or tries to escape by scratching, digging, or biting at the crate, try an alternative, such as a puppy pen or baby gate. If all else fails, seek out a professional behaviorist.\nThey must sit up and take notice.\nSitting is the first command your pup should master as it is the bedrock of basic dog obedience training and lays the groundwork for “stay,” “down,” and other commands. Hover a treat up above your pup and move it backwards, over their head. As soon as your dog’s butt hits the floor, give them a treat and say, “Good sit!” In fact, encourage extracurricular sitting; keep treats on you at all times and every time your dog casually plops down, pay up. Once your dog catches on, up the ante and ask them to sit when it’s time to eat, go for a walk, and at traffic lights.\nIn between cuddle sessions, work on these eight basic cues with your pup.\nWhen they gotta go, they gotta gooutside.\nAccidents happen. An adult, housebroken dog can still suffer a setback or two while acclimating to their new home. To avoid slip ups, set up and stick to a potty schedule. Take dogs under one year old out first thing in the morning, again every few hours (after meals, lapping up water, waking up from a nap...OK, a lot), then right before bed.\nTips you’ll want to pay attention to.\nEven if you have a fenced-in yard, keep your pup on a leash so they grasp that it’s potty time, not playtime. And seek out the same spot because dogs are associative learners and will take the cue that it’s time to pee. Finally, when your dog gets it and ‘goes’ celebrate the breakthrough with a hearty “Good dog!” and keep the treats comin’.\nFlex their brainandbrawn.\nSure, your dog is adorable, and their good looks will never get old. But just like it is for us bipeds, both physical and cognitive exercise is integral to a dog’s wellbeing. You could be an Olympic-level dog walker, but without mental stimulation, your pup will get bored and rebel. Don’t stress: You don’t need to tutor your dog on quantum theory. They boast 50 times more olfactory sensors than we do, so letting them stop and sniff things on walks is the simplest way to keep their synapses firing. In the split-second you’re eyeing the Halal Guys cart across the street, your dog has caught up on all the neighborhood dog gossip— courtesy of the trusty fire hydrant.\nWhy you should let your dog get all their sniffs out on a stroll.\nFor canine wunderkinds (Border Collies, for example) signing up foragility classes (or DIY-ing an agility course at home) can be a great way to get out their aderenaline. Rainy day? Brain games for the win. Hide treats inside interactive toys and puzzles, compelling your pup to problem-solve to find them. They will feel like you do after you finishThe Sunday TimesCrossword — well, except they won’t feel the need for a celebratory Bloody Mary.\nYou’ll brb.\nJust like being attached at the hip to a new partner can sow the seeds of codependency, spending 24/7 with your dog can lead toseparation anxiety. As much as it pains your pup (read: you), start by leaving them alone to take out the trash or grab the mail, gradually increasing your absences by longer increments of time. It can be jarring for puppies in particular to transition from living with littermates to being a solo pet, but baby steps will shore up their independence.\nNote: If you are concerned that your dog has separation anxiety,seek out a professional behaviorist.",

When you think about it, we humans use each other’s names a lot — saying“hello,”getting each other’s attention, and calling out into the void to see if someone is around. We also tend to announce someone’s arrival, as in, “Josh is home!” So, it’s possible your dog already knows your name (and the names of your family members).

The person should also be within sight of your dog. Later, as your dog becomes more competent, the cue “come” can be dropped, and later still, the game can be played when the person they must find is out of sight.\nThere are many practical applications, including in the event of a lost person, or even when someone has just gone out of sight or earshot briefly. It also teaches dogs to find the person in response to the cue and gives them great practice with theirrecall. Among the other benefits: The dog can get physical exercise without their parents having to move, and it can help keep a dogoccupied mentallywhen you’re too busy to engage in more active play.

    },
    "page_content": "Let’s face it: We’re all dealing with something these days, whether anxiety, depression, or a cocktail ofmental healthissues. But while medication and/or talking with a therapist is enough for many, some people need more support than others.\nEmotional support animals (ESAs) provide comfort to those dealing with mental health challenges that could negatively affect their quality of life. Prescribed by licensed psychiatrists, therapists, and psychologists, ESAs go through some form of animal registration and offer support that can be life-changing.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nBut, despite what you might think, ESAs arenotservice animals and don’t receive the same Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accommodations or have the same level of training or dog registration. Because of this difference, ESAs aren’t allowed everywhere their humans are, but they do enjoy some protections under the law. Even though they don’t go through training programs, ESAs should still be well-behaved and know how to follow basic commands. You can even register a service dog online, though doing so is not required or necessary.\nSo, where exactly are ESAs welcome? Let’s break it down.\nSearching for pet-friendly housing? Reading this should be your first move.\nAllowed: Rental Residences\nThanks to theFair Housing Act, ESAs are permitted in any rental residence, even if the landlord has a strict no-pets policy. All housing providers must reasonably accommodate renters with ESAs and are not allowed to charge any additional fees or deposits. ESAs are exempt from any size, weight, or breed restrictions the landlord may have as well.\nBut there are a couple of specific circumstances in which a landlord does not have to allow ESAs:\nAn owner-occupied building with no more than four units\nAn owner-occupied building with no more than four units\nA single-family residence rented by the owner without using an agent\nA single-family residence rented by the owner without using an agent\nOther than these two instances, however, once you have your dog registered as an ESA, any landlordmustallow them.\nNot Allowed: Flights\nUntil January 2021, ESAs were allowed to ride, free of charge, in the cabin on all flights, but revised U.S. Department of Transportationguidancenow limits this benefit to service dogs only. That means that if you want to take your ESA on a flight, they must travel as a pet, so they have to fit in a small carrier, and you may be required to pay pet fees.Psychiatric service dogs(PSDs), however, are still permitted to fly in the cabin with the proper paperwork and dog license.\nPlus, a few products to seal the deal.\nNot Allowed: Restaurants and Shops\nWhile service dogs are allowed in restaurants and retail stores, ESAs don’t have the same level of training and are not permitted in these spaces. However, some businesses, especially smaller local shops, may allow you to bring your ESA inside, but each business owner has the right to refuse to do so. Make sure to follow the rules of your favorite stores and restaurants and stay informed if the rules change at any of those spots.\nAllowed: Public and Common Use Spaces in Apartment Buildings\nBecause ESAs are permitted in apartment buildings and other rental residences, they’re also allowed in anypublic or common spacesthat residents have access to, such as lobbies and elevators.\nNot Allowed: Hotels and Airbnbs\nTemporary housing, such as hotels, motels, and Airbnbs, don’t qualify as permanent residences under the Fair Housing Act. If you’re planning a vacation and don’t want to leave your ESA behind, contact the Airbnb owner personally to ask if you can bring your dog along. Just keep in mind that they have the right to refuse — or to request an additional cleaning fee. Some hotels allow dogs for an extra charge, so look for these businesses if you want to bring your ESA with you on your next trip.\nAllowed: Dorms & University Housing\nJust like apartment buildings, college and university housing must accommodate students with ESAs, according to theFair Housing guidelines. However, universities may have specific requirements for ESAs, such as requiring puppy service dog training, so be sure to check with your school’s student housing office before bringing your pet to your dorm.\nLoyal, devoted, and dutiful, Pit Bulls are proving to be pretty well suited to helping humans in need.\nNot Allowed: University or College Classrooms\nWhile colleges and universities are required to allow ESAs in dorm rooms on campus, the same can’t be said for classrooms. It certainly never hurts to talk to your school about their policies, but in general, universities don’t allow ESAs in classroom settings. If you want to talk to someone at your university or college about accommodating your needs, contact the school’s student services and/or disability services department. While your ESA is not a service dog, you might be able to advocate for yourself in this situation.\nNot Allowed: Work\nYour employer is not required to accommodate your ESA as they do service animals, but each workplace has its own policies. Talk to your manager or supervisor about your specific situation and whether you can bring your ESA to the office with you. Remember, you are your number-one advocate when it comes to getting your needs met in the workplace, and if your ESA is a big part of that for you, it’s OK to ask, if you feel comfortable doing so and think this might be something your manager might entertain. If you want to get a feeling for how your request might be perceived, talk to a coworker you trust about the general environment at your workplace and how they think your ask might be received.\nAsk Permission: Houses of Worship\nWhile churches and other houses of worship areexempt from Title III of the ADAand aren’t required to allow service animals inside, you can ask permission to bring your ESA to services or other events. Many houses of worship are more than willing to allow ESAs and service animals, but they may have their own unique requirements. Again, if you feel comfortable speaking to someone in authority at your place of worship, it’s not a bad idea to ask. These days, as more places or worship are offering in-person gatherings in place of or in addition to the Zoom services of 2020, the leadership in your congregation will likely want you to feel comfortable attending events in person again, if having your ESA there will make that possible.\nThe answer to every (seemingly never-ending) crisis: Dogs.\nAsk Permission: Medical Offices\nWhether you can bring your ESA to your next doctor’s appointment will depend entirely on the office. Some hospitals and private practices allow ESAs, while others may prefer that you leave your support animal at home. Before your next appointment, contact your doctor’s office and ask about their policies. Many people will want to bring their ESA to appointments that might cause them a great deal of anxiety or emotional discomfort; advocating for your needs in the doctor’s office starts before you even enter their door.",

    "page_content": "Kane is a 22-month-old Cane Corso we brought home in March of 2020 as a puppy. He’s not aggressive, but he’s strong. When he wants in or out, he goes up to the door and hits it with his paw. Not only is it damaging the doors in the house, but he does it to people when he wants them to pet him as well. How can we get him to stop “pawing” at things? We call it his “bam bam” because he just hits anything like a bossy beast. —Jamie\nFirst of all, “bam bam” is adorable. Second, as always, one of the most important things to understand in this situation is your dog’s motivation. The reason he’s doing this is probably because he wanted something, he tried something — pawing — and he got access to something. In this case, I wouldn’t be surprised if it started with a door. He may have learned, “Hey, when I mash this door with my giant paw, it opens and I get to go outside.” Or, “If I start scratching the door, everybody freaks out that I’m scratching the door with my giant paw, and they open it for me.”\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nKeep the faith; you can fix this pee-action.\nIt’s hard to ignore a Cane Corso who is pawing at you for attention, but if you give them attention, they learn that their behavior is effective. And if you try to redirect with aboneortoy, they learn they’re actuallyrewardedfor bad behavior.\nUnderstanding Motivators and Consequences\nWe have to look at things from the dog’s perspective. All behavior has three parts. There’s the motivator, which is known as the antecedent. What does the dog want? What is he trying to gain access to or avoid? The second part is the behavior. What does it look like? How often does it happen? How severe is it? And the third part is what the consequence is from the animal’s perspective.\nWhen he paws you, the motivator is attention, the behavior is pawing at you, and the consequence is attention. If the motivation is to go outside, the behavior is pawing the door, and the consequence is the door opening. In both cases, the behavior is reinforced and locked in place. We need the consequence of Kane’s actions to not match his motivator, otherwise there’s no reason for him to stop pawing.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for calming down a dog who’s protective of their turf.\nBefore we can do any of this, we have to be sure that his needs are met. If he really needs to pee, and we’re not paying attention to him, scratching the door makes plenty of sense. So, we have to make sure that his schedule is set and his needs are fulfilled. Then, if it seems like he just can’t seem to stop the door scratching, you can block him from it or come up with other creative ways to prevent him from being able to engage in the behavior.\nRe-Teaching the Consequence\nYour best bet is to be proactive here and teach him how to get what he wants. If he’s pawing at you, you can get up and leave. If you come back and he paws again, continue to get up and leave until he stops — then, when you return, and he doesn’t paw, give him all the attention and loving in the world. If he’s pawing at the door, you can potentially give him a time-out there as well, removing his access from the door and then bringing him back to the door with you — maybe even on a leash. Then have him sit or lay down before opening the door for him. This way, he’ll learn that pawing at the door gets him the opposite of the door, but sitting at the door gets the door to open.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for dealing with an attention-seeking puppy.\nChanging the consequence of pawing without adding something scary or painful is important. We want to make sure that, instead of becoming fearful of certain behaviors, he learns a new skill that gives him access to the outside world.\nFor a while, you may want to require things like sitting, laying down — or eventricks like “handshake”— before giving him anything he wants, like food or access to furniture. All good things should be filtered through you — not because you’re thedominant alpha dog, but because you are his teacher and his guide. You have to show him as you guide him: This is how he can gain access to the things he wants in a calm, focused, non-demanding way.",

    "page_content": "If it’s not one thing, it’s your mother (a joke your therapist might have told you). So much about the way children respond to a variety of situations and challenges is predictable based on the parenting styles in which they are being raised, and new research finds a similar pattern with dogs. In astudyof 48 dogs and their people, published in the journalAnimal Cognition, researchers asked if pet-parenting style affected the way dogs perform in various tasks. Spoiler alert: It sure does!\nResearchers Lauren Brubaker and Monique Udell found that, just as with children, the home life of dogs plays a big role in who they become, how they act, and how they perform when faced with challenges. Udell says, “Dog owners who take the time to understand and meet their dog’s needs are more likely to end up with secure, resilient dogs.”\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nThe Study\nIn the study, pet parents took surveys that were used to classify them into three different pet parenting styles that closely match those of human-parenting styles. Their dogs then participated in three experiments so researchers could access the security of their attachment, their sociability, and their problem-solving skills.\nAnd by kids, I mean pets.\nThe first test assessed the level of attachment the dog has toward their person. To begin, they were in a room together, and the person interacted with their dog if they came close. Then the person left the room briefly before returning and reuniting with their dog. The second test investigated the dog’s social behavior. The dog’s interactions with their person as well as with a stranger were assessed. The third test evaluated each dog’s problem-solving ability by offering them the chance to figure out how to open a puzzle box to get the high-quality food inside.\nAuthoritative Parenting Style\nAuthoritative pet parents are those who have high expectations of their dogs and who are highly responsive to their dogs’ needs and behavior. In this study,  dogs with authoritative parents were generally more secure, more social, and better problem solvers. They were the dogs most likely to have secure attachment styles. They were the most responsive to social cues, chose to be near their people more than they chose to be close to strangers, and showed the highest rates of persistence when trying to solve the puzzle. They were especially focused on the puzzle box when their people offered them encouragement. Only dogs who were being raised by people with this parenting style were successfully able to solve the puzzle and reach the food within the puzzle box.\nAuthoritarian Parenting Style\nAuthoritarian pet parents have high expectations of their dogs but low levels of responsiveness to their dogs’ behavior and their needs. Dogs with this type of pet parent were more likely to be insecurely attached to their people relative to the dogs whose pet parents were authoritative. (The name is similar, but the pet parenting style is quite different!) They also spent more time in the company of their pet parents than the company of strangers. None of these dogs successfully solved the puzzle-box task.\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nPermissive Parenting Style\nPermissive pet parents are people who have low expectations and low levels of responsiveness to what their dogs need and to what they do. Dogs with this type of parent were more responsive to social cues of strangers than to their own people. They spent an equal amount of time near their parents when they were being attentive to their dog as when they were ignoring their dog. These dogs were not persistent when trying to solve the puzzle-box task and had no success at it.\nThe finding that pet-parenting style affects attachment style, sociability, and problem-solving skills matches what we already know from studies of human children. With the increased convergence of caretaking behavior toward kids and toward dogs, it’s little wonder the same parenting styles lead to the same patterns in both species. According to Brubaker, “This research shows that the pet dog-human caretaker bond may be functionally and emotionally similar to the bond between a human parent and their child.”",

    "page_content": "We’ve all been there: some talent show or another is unfolding in front of us — whether on lawn chairs at a state fair or on our couches watchingAmerica’s Got Talent— and the audience goes wild when a perfect little pup takes the stage. It’s objectively impressive every time a stage dog jumps through hoops or responds to complex commands. If we’re being honest, equal levels of “ooh”-ing and “aah”-ing erupt when our friends show us how their pup can shake hands or play dead. The simple truth is that there’s nothing more delightful than a dog with a few tricks up their, uh, paw.\nBut dog tricks don’t only serve as flashy exhibitions. Teaching your dog tricks provides them valuable skills and increases focus, and you’ll also grow your human-canine bond as you train withpositive reinforcement.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nWhy is trick-training good for dogs?\nNo one understands this better than stunt-dog trainer and trick-dog performer Kyra Sundance. Together with her Weimaraner, Chalcy, she has entertained and educated thousands of pet parents around the world through her performances, videos, and books. “Teaching tricks not only teaches skills but also teaches focus and establishes a pattern of learning in the dog,” Sundance says. “Tricks are taught through positive training methods, which promote abondbetween canine and human.” Through trick-training, a few key things happen:\nDogs get plenty of physical exercise\nDogs get plenty of physical exercise\nDogs also get lots of mental stimulation\nDogs also get lots of mental stimulation\nBonds are built between people and their pets\nBonds are built between people and their pets\nBasic obedience skills are reinforced\nBasic obedience skills are reinforced\nDogs have fun with short bursts of training\nDogs have fun with short bursts of training\nThe most mouth-watering treats for training your pup.\nDog trick-training is beneficial for all ages.\nWhen Jadie came into her life as a puppy, Sundance was eager to beginpuppy training. “We started training right away with simple tricks such as ‘sit,’ ‘shake hands,’ ‘spin a circle,’ and‘fetch,’” she says. “We trained in many five-minute sessions per day and worked on several different tricks per session. We went through a lot oftreats!”Incredibly, at the age of four-and-a-half months, Jadie could perform 50 tricks, including rolling herself in a blanket, getting the newspaper from the mailbox, tidying her toys into a toy box, wiping her paws on a doormat, ringing a bell to go outside, and dropping litter into a step can. “Spending this quality time together while she was a puppy built a bond between us that will last a lifetime,” Sundance says.\nDon’t fret if your dog is well beyond the puppy stage. Trick-training is the perfect outlet for dogs of any age. Regardless of their age or experience level, you’re guaranteed to have a happier, healthier dog when you teach them trick-training. You can start off by learning easy tricks, ranging from “sit” and “down” on command to “peekaboo” and “take abow.” Treats are encouraged as a reward. “Sometimes, we need to remind ourselves that training is fun!” Sundance adds. “This joyful attitude builds a bond that will extend into all areas of your life.”\nGo beyond the basics.\nThe Trick of Trick Training\nOne of the secrets to teaching dogs tricks is starting with what theynaturally do. If the dog has a tendency to perform a particular behavior, then it will be easier to make that a cute trick that is performed on cue than trying to get them to do some behavior that is not part of their natural repertoire.The term “capturing behavior” refers to reinforcing your dog for performing a behavior that they do on their own so that they will be more likely to do it again in the future. Once your dog has figured out which behavior is the one that causes you to give them a treat, it is time to start introducing the cue that you will use to tell them to perform that specific behavior.For best success, try capturing behavior that comes so naturally to your dog that they do it often. You can then reinforce it often. You may have to fine tune the behavior to get the trick to be perfect, but you still start by capturing a behavior that your dog already does on their own.\nSome natural behaviors that can be turned into tricks include using paws for high-five, wave, or shake. Dogs who tend to creep when lying down are easy to teach to crawl. Dogs who rest on their backs with their legs in the air are already doing a behavior that many trainers call “belly up.”\nWondering Where to Start? Try the Shell Game.\nIn the classic game, a ball is placed beneath one of three cups (or shells). The shells are quickly shuffled, and your dog shows you which one is hiding the ball.\nYou’ll need three identical flower pots which have a hole at the base allowing your dog to smell the treat underneath. Heavy clay flower pots work well because they won’t overturn easily.\nStart with just one flower pot and rub the inside with a treat to give it lots ofscent. You can even tape a treat inside the pot. Show your dog as you place a treat on the floor and cover it with the pot. Encourage them to “find it!” When they nose or paw the pot, say “good!” (or click yourclicker), and lift pot to reward them with the treat.\nAfter your dog catches on, hold the pot in place and keep encouraging them until they paw at it. Reward any paw contact, and lift the pot.\nAdd two more pots and hold them in place so your dog doesn’t knock them over. Use thepitch of your voiceto calm your dog as they sniff each pot and to excite them when they show interest in the correct one. If your dog paws at an incorrect pot, do not lift it; instead encourage them to keep looking.\nWhen your dog indicates the correct pot, encourage them until they paw at it, then say “good!” and lift the pot to reveal their reward.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nWhat to Expect:\nBe encouraging with your dog and avoid saying “no.” Practice only a few times per session and end with a successful attempt, even if you have to go back to using just one pot to get that success.",

    "page_content": "Jack is a super good boy. The only problem is Jack and his sister Callie are fence fighters. They bark at everyone who goes by, including children, moms with strollers…god forbid they have a dog with them. Jack appears especially scary, throwing himself against the fence. Being part Pittie, he can’t afford any trouble. How do I get Jack to stop being overly protective of his turf and lunging at the fence? — Adria\nJack sounds amazing, and it’s great that he’s found such an understanding family. It sounds like Jack is very protective; he’s probably anxious when outsiders approach, because he sees them as potential intruders. It’s a loving instinct, but as you’ve seen, it can come across as “scary” — and you’re right that, unfortunately, aggressive behavior isjudged especially harshly in Pit Bulls.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nIt can take a long time to train a dog to beless protective, because what you’re really trying to do is calm them, which means changing their emotional reactions. It’ll take a lot of patience and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution, but don’t lose hope — there are ways to relax a fence-attacking dog.\nFirst of all, you need to keep Jack out of the yard until the problem is resolved. Every time he practices leaping at the fence, he gets better at doing it. Right now, Jack potentially sees people as a threat, which is why he’s lunging and barking. He may be trying to discourage the people passing by from entering your property. What’s tricky is that when he barks and lunges and then people continue walking by, he may be seeing this as a cause-and-effect situation; this means every time he barks and someone doesn’t enter, it reinforces his belief that he must bark, because he’s doing a good job protecting his yard.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for dealing with a protective dog that’s taken their duties too far.\nIf there’s any way to block the area from him, he’ll have less of a chance to reinforce the habit. I don’t know Jack well enough to give you exact parameters, but you should find other ways for him to get out and urinate without guarding the fence. If that means you can build a separate section away from that side of the yard, that’s great. If it means he may have to do his business on a leash or on walks for now, that’s another option. But if he’s out in the yard tomorrow doing this, he’s only getting better at it.\nHow to Get Your Dog to Relax\nNext, you should engage in a relaxation protocol. I recommend theKaren Overall Relaxation Protocol.What this does is teach your dog to stay still while more intense things are happening around them. That can start in the house with both dogs; you may have to start one at a time, depending on where they each are in their training. If you can get them to stay while taking, let’s say, three steps back, that might be your day one training.\nThe next day, you have them stay while you clap your hands, then while you turn your back, then while you go to another room — basically, you’re building up to more and more exciting, distracting things happening in their environment. Eventually, you want them to be able to stay still while you open the front door, ring the doorbell, or sit on the ground.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for turning a stressful walk into a chill stroll.\nYou would then take those skills out into the yard with them on their leashes, probably one dog at a time, and train them to sit and stay calm while people are passing. It’s important that you reward them for staying calm when people pass. We need to change your dog’s emotional association to people passing by. That means giving lots oftreatsand pets — or whatever their favorite thing is — whenever they exhibit good behavior.\nAgain, this could be a long road. Avoid using things that promise to be quick fixes. Using force or something that creates pain, like aninvisible fenceorshock collar, can give you a short term change, but the emotional association toward the trigger is likely going to get worse. Jack will just become more concerned about — and afraid of — people passing by, because he’ll associate them with punishment. Instead, use high-value reinforcement for staying calm in the presence of the trigger. This process will take time and patience, but it’s absolutely possible to change Jack’s relationship with the backyard fence.",

    },
    "page_content": "Charley, a rescued three-year-old Lab who’d spent his entire life in an outdoor kennel, was scared of everything when we first got him. He’s been with us for eight months, and now, he panics when we leave him alone. We have two crates, one in our house and one in our car. He goes into the home crate and stays there for about an hour. I’ve been gradually closing the door and even leaving the house, and when I come back, he’s fine. However, when we put him in his car crate, he just loses it, so distraught that he’s destroyed a crate bed and a quilt. Is this separation anxiety? We adore him and want to help him, but what can we do?\nCharley is obviously suffering from a form ofseparation distress, which is not uncommon for a dog who has spent so much of his life in relative isolation. Fear of abandonment and the desire to seek reattachment are what drive some dogs into a panic when left alone, and the resulting destructive behavior is a manifestation of this desperate feeling.Extensive research has shown that dogs suffer from the same kinds offears, phobias, and anxieties as do humans, even experiencing the canine equivalent of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). It would not surprise me if your dog were suffering from a version of PTSD, which could be triggered by being inconfined places, even in a car that he knows. Dogs who become distressed when left alone typically do not do well in confined spaces such ascrates, and in Charley’s case, it’s evident that his anxiety is a result of his previous confinement.You seem to have made good progress desensitizing your pup to the crate in your home, and a similar routine needs to be adopted for the crate in your car. Until he is completely comfortable being in the car, it’s better for him to stay at home, where he feels secure. If you try taking him in the car too early in the process, he will revert to his former behavior, so be sure to work slowly. Here is a step-by-step guide to help a dog scared of cars become accustomed to their crate.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nHow to treat and prevent confinement anxiety.\nCrate Training for Dogs Scared of Car Rides\nTo begin with, show your dog that being in the car is a good thing. At various times during the day, walk him to where your car is parked and either feed him his favorite food in the car or play his favorite game around it.\nAs your dog becomes accustomed to hanging around the car, open the doors and sit next to your pup while he is in his crate, with the crate door open so he can leave if he wants. Allowing him the freedom to make choices will help increase his confidence.\nGive him a durable rubber toy, like afrozen kong, stuffed with food to chew when he’s in the crate. If, however, he decides to leave, gently take the toy from your dog and place it in the crate again, showing him that’s where he gets the nice stuff.\nWhat to do when your dog barks at everything from other cars to people.\nOnly when you see that your dog is eager to be in the car crate with the door open should you start closing the door for short periods while you sit with him. Gradually increase the length of time the door is closed.\nAt this point, you can begin moving away from the car for a minute or two while your pup is chewing on his toy, returning frequently to praise him for calm behavior. As long as your dog is showing no signs of anxiety, you can spend more time away from the car. Repeat this training in different environments until he’s completely comfortable.\nOnce your dog is comfortable in the crate while you drive, take him to a variety of places and repeat the exercise, which will help him learn that being in the car with you in different environments is a good thing.\nIf your pup doesn’t respond to desensitization, you may have to get rid of the crate altogether and use acanine seatbelt harnessinstead, which will keep them safe while allowing them a little more freedom. This in itself may be the only change you need to make for them to feel more secure when they are in the car.\nHitting the road with your dog? Make sure they're safe with this helpful advice.\nA Word of Caution on Leaving Dogs in Cars\nIt goes without saying that a dog should never be left in a hot car. But did you know that it is dangerous to leave them in the car when the weather’s warm (or very cold) too? In direct sunlight, a car can heat up within minutes, even on relatively cool days. A recentstudyfound that 39% of participants were unaware of the ideal temperature in a car for a dog, and almost 16% didn’t know the signs ofheat stroke. Never leave your dog alone in a car with the outside temperatures above 70 degrees outside. Leave your dog at home if you know you will be running errands or going to dinner.",

    "page_content": "In the field of canine science, Alexandra Horowitz, PhD, is nothing short of a legend. I first heard of her as a freshman at Barnard College, when my pet-obsessed friends told me there was a much-loved professor on campus who was famous for studying dog cognition. She and her students conduct their research in the Horowitz Dog Cognition Lab, a center where dogs are brought in for the day by their pet parents — not namelessly confined in cages long-term — to be observed with the goal of understanding how dogs perceive the world.\nHorowitz’s findings have been detailed in the delightful books includingthe New York TimesbestsellerInside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell, and Know;Our Dogs, Ourselves:The Story of a Singular Bond;andBeing a Dog: Following the Dog into a World of Smell— the latter two of which have companion young readers editions. Her new book, which was released this fall,The Year of the Puppy: How Dogs Become Themselves, documents the growth of Horowitz’s pandemic puppy, Quiddity (Quid), during her first year of life.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nPart memoir, part science report,The Year of the Puppyis an empathetic and informative look into what our dogs go through early in their development. Kinship talked to Horowitz about adopting Quid and what she hopes readers will take away from her new book.\nWhat do dogs know and how do they know it?\nWe live with Edsel, a Calico cat in middle age who would like to sit on your lap, and Quiddity, who is a young adult dog now. We adopted Edsel from a local NYC man who fosters street cats; she was about one. After ensuring that she was OK with dogs (we were living with two large dogs at the time) — and they with her — she came to live with us.\nQuiddity I met right after she was born; her mom was a stray, and she was being fostered by a woman upstate. I met the foster when I was looking for litters to follow from birth for my book.\nAs many people who adopted dogs during the pandemic experienced, they were a life-giving force. At a time when we were hugely uncertain about the future, they were a steady distraction, entertainment, and manageable concern right at our feet.\nLili Chin’s bookDoggie Languageillustrates how dogs communicate — beyond ear perks and tail wags.\nFor young dogs, the inability to interact with other dogs, with other people, and to go new places, was a real problem: They need a lot of early socialization so that they don’t develop fears, anxiety, or aggressive behavior to new situations and people and other animals. We spent a lot of time concertedly taking her out to experience new things of all sorts, within the constraints of the pandemic.\nWhile I have lived with many dogs in my life, studied dog cognition for two decades, and have written several books about dogs, I had never known a dog from her first days through adulthood. Like most people who adopt dogs, I’d always begun knowing dogs several months or years into their lives, and I was naturally curious about what happened to them in those early, formative days.\nSo, for this book I wanted to follow a puppy — who we would adopt — from day one, observing her grow, and also discuss the science of early dog development in parallel.\n“She was my lockdown companion, but I had to learn to slowly navigate my fears and anxiety without her as my constant companion.”\nI think it’s helpful to appreciate how quickly dogs develop, and yet that “puppyhood” isn’t just one stage. They go through many stages in their first year, including adolescence, which can explain some of their behaviors. I also hope people feel able to be patient with their dogs’ sometimes slow learning curve [before they master] “how to be a dog in your family.”\nDogs are extremely attentive to us, good readers of our behavior, and naturally flexible in their behavior, but it still takes a while to understand how to live in a human household. Sometimes we think they should just “be trained” and instantly “get it.” That’s not how it works.\nFor me, it is important because dogs are an essential part of my life. I want to know who they are, what needs they have, and what I can do to make their lives better. Dogs do so much for us; I think we owe them the respect of considering who they are.",

For example, my “Yesss” (accompanied bya clicker) to mark a behavior is very different from how I say, “Yes, I’d like fries with that.” My service dog clients learn “down” with a very specific (and unique) vocalization. And yes, our dogs are brilliant enough to pick up on this.\nFor example, this French Bulldog parent shared aTikTok videoof their pup sitting after they said any word they pronounced similarly to how they say “sit.” Why does the dog sit for these random commands?\nBaby talk works on puppies. As for adult dogs, that’s still up for debate.\nFirst, “sit” might be a behavior that gets rewarded a lot. In my house, any dog that comes over gets rewards for sitting. Why? Because I love when dogs choose to sit instead of jumping on me, running out the door, tugging or chewing things. So a nice, patient “sit” gets rewarded alot. It doesn’t take a dog very long to figure out that if they’re unsure what I’m asking, “sit” might be a good guess. And it might be a good guess that ends with atreat.\nSecond, dogs are aware of our vocaltone. if you say “chair” in the same tone in which you say “sit,”  your dog may sit. It sounds enough like “sit” for them to make that same educated guess.\nWill this happen for all dogs? Absolutely not.\n“Hungry” is Rossi’s favorite word, it makes him spin, bark, and prance all over the house. I often ask him before dinner, “Are you…a hippo? Are you…hurting? Are you…” Well, you get the idea, until I finally say “hungry.”  It’s become a fun game for us both as he waits eagerly for the right word to come out. My dogs know a lot of words, but they are trick dogs,movie dogs, and obviously my best friends. When I’m training a behavior they already know, they get a reward for doing the correct behavior the first time I ask. I always mix up the order in which I ask for behaviors, so they know they have to pay attention to what I’m saying.\nTraining a dog can seem pretty intuitive — until it’s not.\nOn set, I can’t say “sit” 20 times for Rossi to sit, so the second I say it, he reacts. He listens intensely — after all, training is his favorite activity besides eating. By doing this, I have taught my dog to really listen. I also practice training in different tones. I may whisper “sit” — I may ask with just a hand cue or in a super excited voice. I do this so that no matter where we are, no matter how I need to ask him for a behavior, it’s not the first time I’ve said it like that.\nThinking about how we speak to our pets and when we reward them can improve our training, too. I often see pet parents ask a behavior two to five times before the dog performs it. This generally comes down tohowthe dog was taught, with someone saying “sit” over and over until Spot sits, and then Spot gets a cookie. If this is happening to you,  say “sit,” be quiet, and wait. If your dog sits, throw him a party! If he doesn’t, go back to training the “sit“ and reward right away for success. Soon, your dog will sit the first time you ask.\nIt’s not always the positive tones — but sometimes the negative ones.\nOur dogs don’t just pick up on the good stuff. They hear when we’re frustrated or angry. We never want them to associate these tones with training. This is the reason that no matter what mood I’m in, myrecall“come” sounds happy and excited. Would my dog like to leave those stinky leaves he’s rolling in to run back to an angry person? Probably not. So, I set him up for success by always using a positive tone and rewarding when he comes back to me.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nAnother example of tone making the difference: ThisPit Bull parenton TikTok says, “You’re a good girl” to their Pittie using a harsh tone — and she gets upset. When they ask, “Who’s a naughty girl?” in a sweet, excited tone, she gets happy and asks for praise.I also know a few dogs whose names sound familiar to other common words. A dog named Juno I know doesn’t always respond to her name, but her name can sound like “no,” especially when her owner is frustrated. Juno’s not being bad; she’s just hearing the “no” sometimes. Thatmightmake you think twice about what youname your pup.",

    "page_content": "There’s a reason that, nearly two decades after his death, Fred Rogers remains a revered cultural icon — and it certainly has nothing to do with the confidence to regularly rock a bright-red cardigan (though, respect). Most of us just admire the effort he put into being a decent neighbor. We appreciate the sentiment because we’ve all had negligent or abrasive neighbors cause serious stress in our lives. Add a dog to that equation and the results can be even more annoying — especially when living in the same building.\nOf course, most pet parents aspire to a more Mister Rogers-esque impact on their community — colorful sweaters notwithstanding. To get you there, Kinship enlisted the help of our friendly (neighborhood)dog trainerand co-founder ofDogboy NYC, Robert Haussmann, for seven tips on how to be a more pleasant and respectful pet parent to those who share your apartment building.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nSearching for pet-friendly housing? Reading this should be your first move.\nAlways have your dog leashed.\nWhether it be walking through the lobby, onto the elevator, up the stairs, or even toward your door, you should have your dogon a leash. “A lot of time, people do a great jobsocializing their dogand they feel like it’s a happy-go-lucky experience. They want the dog to be able to socialize and play, but it’s important to realize that not all people and not all dogs are going to be jazzed about that,” Haussmann explains.\nPersonally, I welcome all and any contact with essentially every dog I meet; however, not all people are as inviting. Maybe they don’t want fur and slobber on their clothes, maybe they’re allergic. Or maybe they’recat people(that’s fine, too). Regardless, engaging with your dog should be their decision and respected as such — even if some individuals (read: me) believe they’re missing out on one of the greatest joys life has to offer.\nApproach other dogs with caution (and consent).\nSimilarly, if you see someone else in the building with a dog, don’t assume they are willing or able to interact. Haussmann notes that if you’re approaching someone with a dog, permission should be your No. 1 priority because while your pup might be perfectly sociable, others may not be so lucky. If a dog has behavioral issues oris reactive, blindly introducing them could be a disaster.\n“Even dogs that your dog knowswhen at the dog parkcould have issues in their apartments. They might feel guarded or have some territorial issues in and around the building. So, it’s always better just to keep them leashed and keep your space,” Haussmann says.\nThere’s a lot more to it than sniffing each other’s butts.\nNot to mention, a bad interaction could erode your previously sociable pup’s excitement and comfort with other pets. Let’s say you and another dog owner in the building do want to intro your pups; Haussmann advises doing so on a walk together. This will minimize the risks of territorial reactions.\nBe cautious in the public spaces of your apartment building.\nBeyond teaching me that I’m attracted to angelic men with long blond hair,The Lord of the Ringstrilogy showed me that there are always several different ways to arrive at one singular destination. And while riding giant birds is unlikely outside of Middle Earth, you should still keep options in mind when making the trek from the lobby to your apartment door.\nIf your dog is reactive or easily excitable, give them and yourself extra space between the elevator door. In fact, Haussmann suggests calling the elevator and taking a step back. “Give yourself and the dog some more room to make sure that you can be successful and have control over the situation,” he says.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s pro tips for getting a hyped-up dog to chill out.\nWhen dealing with jumpy dogs,treat traininganda solid walking kitcan pay huge dividends in taming their energy. “Make sure that you’re using treats or a harness — something that’s going to make it less successful for the dog to jump,” Haussmann says. If it’s an especially busy time of day, and there’s a lot of foot traffic, consider the stairs. As long as it’s not a steep walkup and your dog can handle the extra workout, the stairwell should be much less crowded. Plus, it technically counts as exercise, so you can use it as an excuse to skip the gym that day (and every day).\nInvest in a thick rug.\nDogs are going to run around and play. They’re going toget the zoomies. It’s kind of their whole deal. For this, a big ol’ rug is your best move to limit how much the people below you hear paws bounding across the floor. And besides — it’ll probably tie the room together. It also helps that a lot of buildings are now encouraging or flat-out requiring renters to do some form of this even if they’re not pet owners.\n“Even without dogs, they want you to have some carpeting down so that it’s a bit of a sound absorber for your neighbors,” Haussmann explains. He adds that dogs who frequently get the zoomies could benefit from additional walks or trips to the park for extra exercise.\nDo your best to minimize barking.\nThis is the big one and probably what you’re most likely to hear complaints about. Unfortunately, it’s a complicated issue.Dogs barkfor any number of reasons, and Haussmann explains that deciphering the motivation behind the action is crucial in tempering it. A likely scenario here is barking for attention, though combating that is not as easy as saying, “No.” According to Haussmann: “A dog who’s being scolded for barking is still getting your attention.”\nThe top five reasons dogs bark—and how to get them to relax a bit.\nInstead, you must remove the attention altogether by either leaving the space or taking your dog out of the room. If that doesn’t work, Haussmann suggests another option that will give you flashbacks of elementary school: “You can utilize timeouts, but that’s only fair if the dog is having theirphysical exercise,mental stimulation, and environmental enrichment needs met.”\nIt’s also important not to reward this behavior. For example, if a dog barks for food and you immediately give them kibble, they’re going to continue barking whenever they want something.\nHelp them enjoy their alone time.\nWe have to leave our apartments eventually. Haussmann explains that when dogs areuncomfortable being alone, they may fear they’ve lost access to food, water, or the bathroom and panic-bark. Plus, thanks to us all recently spending months locked up inside,separation anxiety in pupsis at an all-time high. For these dogs, Haussmann recommends pairing your absence with something exciting or fun to create a positive association.\nHe suggests having a certain toy you only give to your pup when you leave. “So, you’re purposely giving them some time to entertain themselves when they’re all by themselves, even in your absence,” he says. The most effective leaving-the-apartment toys are ones that are mentally stimulating, such as a lick mat orKong. These will also help occupy their attention while you’re out attending to your silly human responsibilities.\nLet the games begin.\nIf all else fails — apologize with gifts!\nLook, I love my dog more than anything, but she is a wild animal. I can’t permanently keep her from running around, barking, or having a full-blown mental breakdown every time there’s thunder. In situations like this, Haussmann has a simple solution. “You might want to send your downstairs neighbor a bottle of wine and a letter from your dog saying, ‘Hey, I’m a puppy; this is going to happen. We’re working on it,’” he says.",

    "page_content": "Training a dog can seem pretty intuitive: Reward them when they do what you want; withhold said reward when they don’t. But in case you needed a reminder, dogs aren’t humans, which means our brains don’t always understand theirs.\nCase in point: “People often make everyday mistakes that either confuse their dog, encourage poor behavior, or otherwise undo their training progress,” Kim Roche, certified dog trainer and behavior consultant in Austin, Texas, says. Most dogs pay better attention than you think, she says, and at the end of the day, even the most rambunctious dog wants to do right by you — but trouble ensues when they don’t know how.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nOf course, being 100 percent intentional with every little move you make around your dog is near impossible. But just being aware of the following common mistakes can make a huge difference in their manners — a win-win for you and your ready-to-please pup.\nCalling Them Over and Over\nNo shame if you’ve had to shout for your dog repeatedly at the dog park or on the beach. Recall — calling your dog’s name when they’re off-leash so that they come back to you—can besuperchallenging to teach. But it’s also probably the most important part of training, says Jamie Hansen, an Aussie dog trainer and breeder in La Center, Washington, because it involves your dog’s (and potentially other dogs’) safety.\nTeach your pup a perfect recall so you can be sure they will come back, no matter what.\nLet’s say you call for your dog eight times before they show up at your feet. That’s bad, says Hansen, because instead of responding to their name, your dog has now associated your calls as background noise. “You want them to turn their head and come to you on the first call, or second if they’rereallydistracted,” she says.\nTo train this behavior, Hansen recommends attaching your dog to a leash or line outside where they can run to a certain point. Bring the extra-yummytreatsand call them: As soon as they turn their head tolookat you, throw them a treat — and keep doing that, throwing treats on alternate sides of you. This teaches them to stop whatever they’re doing (no matter how exciting that squirrel or tiny Chihuahua might be) and pay attention toyou. Try it at least three times a week for a couple of weeks and you’ll see a huge difference in their response, says Hansen — from there, you can start to work on the behavior in safe off-leash areas.\nUsing Only One Reinforcer\nOK, we just told you to use treats for recall. But for smaller good-pup behaviors, you’ll want to think outside the biscuit box. “If you rely solely on treats to reinforce positive behaviors all the time, at some point, the excitement of the reward fades a bit,” Roche says. And if you run out of treats or forget to bring them? You’re SOL.\nThe most mouth-watering treats for training your pup.\nYour move: Mix up your reward toolbox, using other pleasurable incentives for everyday good behaviors (like sitting when you ask them to).Pet your dogon the head, give a belly rub, play with them, throw the ball — “any mix of things they love will cultivate a very stable dog that is able to work without food,” says Roche.\nGiving Treats at the Wrong Time\nMore on treats! (Because they’re so key to a dog’s feedback loop.) “Dogs are self-important, which means that they’re looking out for their own needs and will manipulate us to meet them,” Hansen says. If you reward your dog in a moment when they don’t deserve the reward — say, they finally lie down after you asked them to 14 times — you’re reinforcing that they get a treat when they do things ontheirtimetable.\nWhich one is yours?\nUse “good girl” or “good boy” when they’ve listened after a while — if you’ve done even basic training work, they’ll know that if they do things better/faster, theycanget a treat with this behavior. Similar to the recall thing, save treats foronlywhen they’ve listened on the first or second command.\nGoing on Autopilot on Walks\nWe know, we know: Sometimes the only time you have to make that important call or vent to a friend or brainstorm for work is on your daily walks with your dog. But try not to. “We’re all human, which means we are absolutely going to overlook instances of good behavior sometimes,” says Roche. “But if we habitually do that, there’s really no difference to your dog between a behavior going unreinforced because we forgot to applaud it or because we don’t want them to do it anymore.”\nMake a point to reinforce as many positive behaviors your dog does as possible in real time, including the spontaneous ones. Remember, they don’t go autopilot on you (just one more reason we don’t deserve them).\nShushing Them\nPicture this: Your dog starts barking when the Amazon guy delivers the harness you ordered. It’s natural to try to quiet them with a “shhhhhh,” the way you would a crying baby, but again, dogs aren’t crying babies. “Energy feeds energy, and the ‘shh’ sound can sound like a small critter or the sound of running through grass,” says Hansen. “What they hear is: ‘more energy! — the opposite of what you want.”\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nInstead, use a cue word or phrase consistently, like “it’s OK,” or “calm,” in a lower-tone, soothing voice, Hansen recommends. In time, they’ll learn to match your energy.\nSaying “Down” When Inappropriate\nTrainers generally use the word “down” to teach a dog to lie down on the ground. If you’re using it for anything but — like, to tell them to get down from the couch, or to go back to their spot in the car — you’re creating a miscommunication, Roche adds.\nTry your best to save “down” for when youactuallymean lie down. Say “off” when you need them to get off of something (be it furniture, a person or another dog). The goal is to be extremely explicit with each command, says Roche — your dog will do what you say, so make sure you’re saying what you mean.\nNot Using Hand Signals\nOn that note, dogs flourish with multiple cues for the same behavior, says Roche. Using one word alone can work for many instances, but you’ll increase your dog’s chances of listening success if they can understand you with their earsandeyes, she explains. (Also, if you’re ever in a loud or busy environment, or your dog evergoes deaf…you’ll be glad you started this.)\nWhen it’s time to call in reinforcements.\nPair your most-used commands with a gesture that matches, recommends Roche, such as pointing down with “sit,” flexing your hand like a stop sign with “stay,” and pushing air away with “off.”\nNot Being Direct\nEspecially with puppies or a rescue dog that’s new to your home, you want to give them actual instructions. “Imagine you have a toddler getting into things: You could never just say, ‘Stop doing everything and just do nothing,’ notes Roche. “But you could say, ‘Go to your bed and lie down.’” Dogs are the same way.\nUh, who else gotthatmemo?\nNext time you want your dog to just chill TF out, be super specific with your instructions (that may mean showing them the behavior yourself, by going to their bed) and/or give them a project (like a rubber toy stuffed with kibble) to occupy them. It works!\nExpecting Too Much\nOof, this one can manifest in so many ways. “Dogs are often smarter than we think, but we have to remember that they learn from us,” says Hansen. In other words, we can’t just assume they understand what to do just because it makes sense to us.\nA prime example: You tell your dog to stay, then you walk away from them to test them and they break their stay. “We have to train them to understand the word, and to make that happen, you would wait for a second and give them a cookiebeforethey get up, not after,” says Hansen. “You want to reward the staying put,notthe getting up part.” Once they get a hang of this,thenyou can start to walk away, or dance, or do whatever you want as they sit there expectantly until you release them. Same goes for any trick or basic behavior — patience is key.\nMissing Chances for Training Advancement\nIf you want your dog to be good all of the time (or let’s be real, most of the time), you have toteachthem to be good all of the time. And that means making the most of even mundane moments, like feedings, to encourage wanted behaviors, says Hansen.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nHave your dog sit before you give them dinner. Continue their walk only when they’ve stopped acting out. Make them work for every treat you give. Rub their belly (if they like that) when they stay by your feet instead of climbing on the couch next to you. “You don’t need every training lesson to be an hour,” says Hansen. “Every minute of interaction counts.”",

Here are a few examples of when you could use a hand.\nIs your pup doing damage?\n“What’s your damage?” isn’t just an underrated line fromHeathers.

Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nNo matter what kind of damage you’re dealing with, if your dog is stuck in a destructive pattern that you’re not having much luck breaking, it’s time to call a professional dog trainer.\nThe questions to ask and credentials to look out for to find the right trainer foryourdog, according to a pro.\nAre you a brand-new dog parent?\nIf you’re a first-time pet parent, there’s no shame in asking for support. Start with a one-on-one consult to assess your needs, whether it be group classes, a package of private lessons, or virtual sessions. You may find that you (and your dog) pick up training cues quickly and can take it from there. Certified dog behaviorists have made it their life’s work to help guide pet parents through the ups and downs — enlisting their help will set you and your pup up for success.\nHave you been seeking the answer to,How do I get my dog to stop doing…?\nIf you’re lying awake at night stressing about how to convince your dog that your All Birds aren’t chew toys, behavior modification can handle that heavy lift. Where basic obedience is, well, basic (e.g. sit, stay, heel), behavior modification is about getting to the root of the problem and altering the way your dog feels about something. That process is no walk in the park and a certified behaviorist will tailor a plan to your dog’s unique situation.\nHow do I find the right trainer for my dog?\nYou may have noticed the term “certified” used a few times throughout this article. That’s not us running out of synonyms — it’s because dog training is actually an unregulated industry. You could decide tomorrow that dog training is your calling, throw a website together, and bam, you’re in business.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nThis lack of accountability has unfortunately led to many dogs being poorly handled or even mistreated. Best case scenario: your dog doesn’t learn a whole lot and you’ve your wasted time (and okay, money). Worse, an inexperienced or ineffective trainer manhandles your dog, makes the problem worse, or pushes your dog until it becomes defensive or aggressive.\nSo how are you supposed to know whoisqualified to train your dog? For starters, look for trainers whose names are followed by CPDT (Certified Professional Dog Trainer) or CBCC-KA (Certified Behavior Consultant Canine-Knowledge Assessed). Then, beyond asking dog parent friends for recos and reading reviews, narrow down your choices by buzzwords like evidence-based, science-based, force-free, fear-free, and positive reinforcement. Unless your dog has a serious aggression issue, steer clear of trainers who rule by fear and discipline dogs with e-collars (a.k.a. shock collars). And remember, you’re not alone!",

    },
    "page_content": "Now thatbivariant COVID booster shotsare available, and official guidelines seem to change almost daily, it’s clear that this virus is something we are going to be living with for a while. We are also nearing the three-year (!) anniversary of its entrance into our lives, and experts feel it may be time to bring humanity’s best and most dependable friends into the fight against COVID. Yes: we’re talking COVID-sniffing dogs.\nSuch a role isn’t so far outside a professional canine’s proven skillset: scenting contraband, finding missing children, possibly even detecting undiagnosed cancer. Recent studies show they might be remarkably successful in detecting COVID, too.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nThis summer, the journalPLOS Onepublished a study by Dr. Dominque Grandjean, of France’s Alfort School of Veterinary Medicine, reporting that dogs correctly identified COVID-positive human sweat samples with 97 percent accuracy in a study sample of 335 people, and even found all 31 of the asymptomatic Covid cases among 192 people.\nThis kind of efficacy rivals that of nasal-swab tests, and another journal,Science News, shared accounts of dogs actuallybeatingthe PCR test, detecting COVID in asymptomatic patients a full 48 hours earlier than PCR swabs did.Some experts — called bio-dog medical scent detection trainers — say they weren’t surprised by the striking results. “It’s on par with what I would expect from a well-trained bio dog,” certified bio-dog trainer Ariel Vergel explains to Kinship via email. “High sensitivity and specificity results — with a delightfully non-invasive collection process.”\nA Job That Makes Sense\nAnother certified bio-dog trainer, Melissa Russell, likens the challenge a COVID-sniffing dog would face to discerning cancer, diabetes, or epilepsy. “I do feel that the efficacy [for COVID-detection] is there,” says Russell, whose animals can detect cancer and diabetes in humans. “Dogs are highly, highly capable of picking out cancer from non-cancer, as well as drugs, bugs, different kinds of plants; it all matters what you train them to detect.”\nIn cases like cancer or diabetes, dogs are likely detecting some form of volatile organic compound (VOC) due to chemistry changes in the body caused by infection or mutation. “My teacher likened it to a suitcase,” Vergel says. “We may not know all of what’s inside, but if trained correctly, [a bio dog] can identify the common denominator between several ‘suitcases.’ And so long as they are accurately alerting on a repeated basis, we humans don’t really need to know which item it is to utilize their life-saving skills. We trust the training and the dog.”\n“Dogs can smell the presence of a teaspoon of sugar in an Olympic-sized pool.”—Certified bio-dog trainer, Melissa Russell\nIf detecting the microscopic coronavirus in a person standing a foot away sounds to you like a stretch, Russell says we underestimate the precision instrument that’s at the end of a dog’s snout. “Dogs can smell the presence of a teaspoon of sugar in an Olympic-sized pool,” she says. That said, COVID does present new challenges.\n“COVID is so new that we still don’t really know that much about it,” she says. “People react to it in so many different ways, and the number of variables may make it difficult to train a dog against all of them.”\nUnlike a nasal swab, a dog runs the risk of contracting COVID themselves. “According to theCDC website, dogs can contract it as humans can, and for us, the primary prevention method is the avoidance of inhaling the VOCs of others by avoiding close contact and using masks, Russell adds. “If the dog is directly inhaling an infected sample I would think their risk would be high for contraction.”\nNose Swabs Aren’t Going Anywhere\nRussell says that COVID-positive sweat or other substances might be used for training instead of a sample of the live virus. She likens this to the training epilepsy-detecting dogs undergo: “They smell a hormone or something else that’s released prior to a seizure.” They can smell elevated levels of different agents, depending on what you train them for.”\nAs appealing as it would be to replace a sinus-gouging swab with a friendly sniff from a German Shepherd, COVID bio-dogs aren’t filling in for PCR tests any time soon. “The PCR tests are quick and efficient,” Russell says. “I don’t see dogs replacing them so much as augmenting virus detecting in public spaces. I can see them using dogs in airports, maybe, to initially get someone to take a test. The whole idea is not to replace PCR tests with dogs; we just want to be able to find it quicker, get an earlier warning.”\nBut like bomb-sniffing dogs, this would require an exceptionally high amount of training beyond the ability to detect the agent. “To be reliably alert in such an overwhelming environment, [the training needed for success] would by far surpass the five to six weeks training in the study,” Vergel says. “The sheer amount of scents alone would be enough to raise the difficulty level, but then there are also sights and sounds to be accounted for. High distractions can lower a dog’s focus, and thus their success rates.”\nBut Dogs Aren’t Out of the Question\nA more likely scenario, Russell says, would be a canine-staffed testing facility in or near the building, adding that an ideal location would be “somewhere the animals could be reasonably isolated to better perform, while collecting samples on the spot from travelers, who would then be required to wait for their results before proceeding.”\nDespite compelling results in cancer-detection studies — “anywhere from an 80 to 95 percent success rate,” Russell says — even cancer-detecting bio dogs are rarely used in the real world. “Right now, the only place I know of that’s using dogs to detect cancer isthe Enloe Hospital,in Chico, California, and I believe Chicago has aprogramwith their firefighters as well.”\n“The canine olfactory sense is a heavily studied, repeatedly proven, and utterly underutilized medical tool humans could benefit from.”—Certified bio-dog trainer, Ariel Vergel\nFor her part, Vergel isn’t holding her breath for this to take hold across the country. “I imagine we will not see very many dogs in action this fall. Proving their capabilities for diagnosis is one thing but, as in the world of cancer, that does not necessarily mean that these dogs and their handlers will be allowed to operate in this capacity.”\nWere public health officials to employ COVID-sniffing dogs, she adds, “perhaps that would remove some of the obstacles currently preventing cancer detection from being used as a regular option for diagnosis. In that way, COVID-detection dogs could save a lot more lives than just those whose samples they actually sniff. For me that would be the most exciting result from this study. The canine olfactory sense is a heavily studied, repeatedly proven, and utterly underutilized medical tool humans could benefit from.”\nIt’ll be some time before troops of COVID-trained bio dogs march to battle a pandemic, so should we take matters into our hands and train our own dogs to sniff out COVID?\n“Probably not,” Russell says with a chuckle. “There are more important health applications to train your dog for. Epilepsy, PTSD, stress — any of these would be a better use of your dog’s time.”",

When the server approached us to take our orders, she did what most dog-friendly service people do: She asked if Miley could have a T-R-E-A-T. “Sure,” I said, and before I knew it, Miley’s left paw was nestled in the server’s right hand. I, being the one who taught Miley to shake, was proud.That was, to my surprise, until two of my friends broke into a conversation about how they purposelydidn’tteach their dogs to shake. After a little bit of back and forth, my pride quickly turned into embarrassment, and shortly after that, shame.\nWhen did “shake” become a no-no? Did it deserve its seemingly new bad rap? And more important: Should I stop using it? For the sake of my own pride after that interaction with my friends, I had to find out.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nA Little Bit of History\n“Shake,” as a command, has been around for a very long time, but it wasn’t up for debate until semi-recently. In the ’80s and ’90s, dog trainers taught tricks for consistent and impressive conduct — but without a strong grasp of canine behavior and learning theory (how a dog processes and retains knowledge), says Kim Roche, CDBC, CPDT-KA, a dog trainer and certified behavior consultant in Austin, Texas. It wasn’t until the 21st century that trainers became educated in learning theory and could truly understand the power of a certain command, she says. As such, most have stopped teaching it. But why?\nIn between cuddle sessions, work on these eight basic cues with your pup.\nThe Problem With “Shake”\n“‘Shake’ is a really cute trick, and so it’s often one of the first people teach their dog,” says Jamie Hansen, dog trainer and owner ofDiamond Hill Dog Trainingin La Center, Washington. “People love the contact and interaction with a dog through a human gesture.”\nThe issue is: Cute can quickly turn ugly, warns Roche. “‘Shake’ is usually a harmless trick, but I have seen it go wrong,” she says, recalling stories of dogs knocking tea out of someone’s hands or whacking a child in the face.That risk is inherent in the trick because “we know now that any behavior we teach a dog through positive reinforcement will almost always occur spontaneously, too,” says Roche. This means that unless you’re living with a trained service dog or you’ve donea lotof work on stimulus control, your dog will probably extend its paw in hopes of getting a treat or a handout in moments youdon’twant them to.\nAlmostallnew puppy parents fall at the first hurdle. Here, pro tips on picking yourself up.\nIt’s a slippery slope, says Roche. “If we teach a dog to shake, we’re teaching them ‘go ahead and put a paw on a person.’ For most dogs, it’s incredibly hard to know that one is OK but two isn’t, and before you know it, you have an otherwise great dog jumping when that’s not an encouraged behavior,” she explains.\nSomeone could get very hurt.\nFor your dog — particularly if you have a shy one — “shake” could also invite distress, adds Roche. Your pup might be cool with being touched in one context but not another, and bringing strangers into the mix (often the case with the “nice-to-meet-you” shake trick)? It could put them on edge and result in a not-so-welcoming reaction.\nShaking Off “Shake”\nThat’s not to say you can’t or shouldn’t teach your dog to shake — your dog, your decision! Don’t let anyone’s opinion or judgment (note to self: not even your friends’) dissuade you from something you feel good about.\n“All that matters is your personal tolerance — do you care if your dog paws when you don’t want them to?” asks Hansen.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a shy pup to go from wallflower to social butterfly.\nIf youdocare, you can stop asking for a shake and just reinforce a nice sit. But you can also teach your dog an even cuter, but less problematic trick, says Hansen: the wave. It’s a little harder to teach, she notes, but it (1) removes the contact, and (2) takes more effort for your dog to execute, so they’re less likely to do it unprompted.\nTo teach it, Hansen says you’ll first need your dog to learn how to sit on their hindquarters:  From a sit position, hold a treat over their head and get them to stretch a little from their hind legs.\nNext, have them hold this stretched position for a few seconds (keep giving them treats — P.S. they’ll have to use those muscles!), then show them how to wave by one of two ways. Either take their paw and raise it up, giving them a treat as you say the word “wave.” Or, if your dog is pretty sharp, you can wave yourself, saying the word until they try it on their own.\nAs for me and Miley? We’re slowly casting out the word shake, but we haven’t quite gotten a hang of the whole wave thing yet. I’m confident, though, that we’ll get there…and when we do,everyone— servers, friends, myself included — will be not only proud, but impressed.",

    "page_content": "Peach is a four-year-old Pomeranian / mini Poodle mix. He had an excellent start to life. Ever since my spouse, Peach, and I moved from our 600 square-foot city apartment into a 2,000+ square foot suburban home we share with another couple and dog, our pup has decided that every room is the bathroom. He pees and poops everywhere. We’ve tried giving him more built-in potty times, but he no longer requests to go outside; he just finds a secret spot. We’ve tried potty bells (he’s afraid) and keeping doors shut, but I think the environment is just so different.\nWow — congrats on the big move. Moving is stressful for humans and dogs alike. You’re right that environment is a factor in Peach’s behavior. His routine is off; there’s more space. He doesn’t yet understand the ritual of going to the bathroom in your new home. He might be confused if he’s used to going to the bathroom on the cement, and suddenly we’re asking him to go on a big grass yard. The same goes for if he went on a leash and now he’s free to roam. There are several ways we can help Peach adjust to his new surroundings.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nKeep the conditions as similar as possible.\nIf he’s used to urinating and defecating on cement, bring him out to the cement. If he would go on walks, take him for a walk. Sometimes when we go from the city to the suburbs, we put a dog out on the yard and the dog just doesn’t get it — they have no way of knowing that’s their new going-out routine.\nTips you’ll want to pay attention to.\nDon’t punish accidents.\nRight now, going to the bathroom is self-rewarding for Peach. If he poops behind the couch and no one sees it, he’s fine with that; it feels good, and it was successful. Even if you see him an hour later and tell him “no,” he doesn’t know what you’re talking about. And if you catch a dog in the act and get really mad, they’ll just assume you have a weird hang-up about urine, and then they’ll try to hold it when you’re around — which is a problem when you’re trying to get them to go outside.\nBringing a dog back to their own urine and rubbing their face in it just freaks them out, I promise. They aren’t learning from that experience. So even though it’s frustrating, if he goes inside, chalk it up to confusion. Don’t get angry with him.\nCelebrity dog trainerVictoria Stilwell on how to keep your dog from using your living room as a toilet.\nPut your dog’s food on a schedule.\nIn order to train your dog to go in a certain area, you need to know when the dog needs to go. The first thing we need to do is schedule what goes in and what goes out. You’ll want to put food and water down on a schedule. I would keep a log of what goes in and what time it goes in and what comes out and what time it comes out — and where. So, if you know your dog drinks water at 8 AM and then pees in the house by 9 AM, you can start to understand what’s going on with that dog’s biology. We need to be at the right place at the right time.\nIf you can’t figure out their schedule or they’re refusing to go outside when you take them, you might have to keep your dogconfined to a crateorleashed by your sideso he can’t wander off and do his business away from you. You want to know where he is and what he’s doing. If you see him start to sniff around, you can try to rush him to the right place. The idea is to not allow him to have the need while he’s inside and doesn’t know where to go.\nA dog food measurement by any other name would be confusing.\nReward, reward, reward.\nWhen he eventually goes outside, tell him he’s amazing. Give him a high,high value treat— make it a celebration. Eventually, he’ll learn that the yard is the most rewarding place to do his business.\nIn summary, your first goal is to be able to predict when Peach has to go, that way you can be around to show him the right place. You can do this by feeding on a schedule and keeping Peach within eyesight. Don’t punish, and don’t be afraid to experiment with outdoor spaces. It’s a big move, and Peach needs some time to adjust — but with time and patience, he’ll get a hang of suburban life.",

    },
    "page_content": "It all started forDr. Marty Beckerin 1963: That was the year his family’s outdoor Labrador Retriever came inside the house.\nDr. Becker grew up on a small family farm that raised potatoes and other crops, in addition to cows, sheep, and pigs. Dogs served a utilitarian role on the farm — they herded cattle and guarded the property among other duties. But when a blizzard swept through in 1963, a young Dr. Becker successfully convinced his father to let their outdoor dog spend the night inside. He never left.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nIn the decades since, Dr. Becker has made a name for himself as “America’s Veterinarian”; he was the resident veterinary contributor onGood Morning Americafor 17 years, is the author of23 books, and is also the founder ofFear Free, which provides online education to veterinary and pet professionals, animal welfare communities, and pet owners. Kinshiprecently sat down with Dr. Becker to ask him about what Fear Free actually means — and why modern-day pet parents, whosepets are their children, are embracing the method.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nIt boils down to looking at [a pet’s] physical and emotional well-being. Before Fear Free, the focus was always on physical wellbeing. Most of my colleagues and I thought that fear, anxiety, and stress were collateral damage — that there was nothing you could do. You could still be compassionate, you could still look at pain, but you just had to accept that [a pet] hated going to the veterinarian or trainer or groomer.\nFear-Free training is positive reward-based training. Part of our slogan is to “put the treat into treatment.” You show [a pet] what you want them to do and then reward them when they do it, or get close to doing it. Fear Free always works to reduce or remove triggers that cause fear, anxiety, and stress.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nIf I were a therapist, I could ask you all sorts of things that happened in your life that were traumatic and you could ferret them out and we could decide we’re going to avoid this, or you’re going to deal with it this way. With a pet, you have no ideawhat happened to them. Were theyattacked by another dogwhen they were younger? Did something negative happen to them on a walk? Were they dragged out of a cage at a veterinary hospital?\n[Fear-Free training involves] the pet parent on the front end of visiting a veterinarian, groomer, or trainer. A pet parent can’t bring in a pet that’s really agitated and throwing up from stress and think it’s going to be a good visit. [Fear-Free training] starts in the living room. If a pet is going to be in a carrier, [the pet parent] got it out a week before, not the night before or the morning of. High-value rewards are given there so there are positive associations with the carrier. In transport, you keep the car at the same temperature as the house. If you’re going to a trainer, it’s the same temperature there. If the dog is in the carrier, you make sure the carrier is not tipped and covered on three sides by a light sheet to reduce visual stimuli.\nFear Free is a science-based organization. There’s over 300 studies it’s based on. We fund a decent amount of research for the size or our company. We know, for example, that pets in transport like fleece better than towels. They like pastel colors and certain types of music. It’s how pets are introduced to a facility. If somebody comes to your house or if you go to a groomer, if the pet is greeted outside in what is neutral territory, it makes a big difference, as opposed to going inside the facility, because then they’re not territorial.\n[Humans] are primarily verbal communicators and [pets are] primarily body- language communicators. Once you understand [your pet’s]body language, you almost crack the code on a different level of understanding and appreciating your dog. You get to where you’re detecting the most subtle changes early on before it erupts into something worse.\nDogs and cats can’t read self-help books, so a veterinary behaviorist explains how your pet may benefit from being in treatment.\nI was at a conference in 2009, andDr. Karen Overallgave the keynote. Her talk changed my life. Her first sentence was, “Fear is the worst thing a social species can experience, and it causes permanent damage to the brain.” Second sentence: “Those of us in veterinary medicine, training, grooming, animal services are causing repeat, severe psychological damage to pets by what we are doing or not doing.” She continued: “Behavior produces a physiologic response so behavior is medicine. Fear is caused by something painful or something disturbing.”\nShe gave some great examples. You trim a dog’snails too short.Now when they see the nail trimmer, or even the place where you trim them or the drawer that they’re held in — that’s disturbing.\nThe thing that really got me: All pets are the equivalent of a 1-year-old child. There are four reasons. One, they’re taken against their will for healthcare. Two, they have zero idea why a procedure benefits them. Three, they have no concept of time. And lastly, they have no control — they can’t flee the threat. That’s the important part; we have control over stuff that they don’t.\nThere’s nothing to fear but fear itself — and a dog who won’t stop shaking when it thunders.\nWe figured out how to do [Fear-Free training] in the veterinary hospital, in probably the worst setting. If we could remove or reduce the triggers — we call it “taking the pet out of petrified” — in that setting, we figured you could probably do it in other settings. And we thought, what good is it to have a phenomenal visit to the veterinarian when [a pet is] suffering from anxiety and stress at home?\nSo, we’ve [created certificates for] training, grooming, pet sitting, boarding, and daycare, dog walking is coming up. Everybody that has contact with a pet [should look] at both its physical and emotional well-being.\nProbably the biggest thing is that pets don’t have emotions like we do. You can’t anthropomorphize pets too much, but pets definitely have feelings. When your dog looks at you, that is the look of love. That is unmistakable; it melts you. I don’t think a human can do the same thing — it doesn’t look the same. So yes they love, yes they have fear, have anxiety, have loneliness. They have all these same things.\nThe other thing is that every single day your dog is being trained. Something happens that changes [the pet’s] behavior every day, so you have to be careful that you’re always working so the pet has the kind of manners that fit in with the happy home.\nIt’s a gut thing: Your dog’s GI issues could be linked to their mental health.\nFear Free Happy Homesis complementary to all pet parents. There’s no login or barriers. Everything we have is reviewed by [a] boarded veterinary behaviorist. That’s one of the things we’re really proud of. It’s authentic information.\nThe worst thing for a pet parent is to feel like you’re hurting your pet by trying to help them. If your pet thinks it will absolutely be harmed or is going to die when it goes to the veterinarian, that’s a red flag. If the vet insists on putting your pet up on the table every time, that’s a red flag. If they’re handling them roughly or restraining them, that’s a red flag.\nWhat [Fear Free does] is gentle control. You still get the same thing — positional compliance — but it’s designed to protect the pet. Restraint is designed to protect people. So your pet should be more cooperative in its care — they’re not showing extreme distress, they’re taking treats. You can tell if your vet has an affection for your pet and isn’t treating it like an inanimate object.\nAnd trainers — anyone that is using prongcollarsor shock collars or any kind of aversive training.\nThe questions to ask and credentials to look out for to find the right trainer foryourdog, according to a pro.\nIf you love your pet like family, I would want you to have the same level of science and soul that you would have for a human child or grandchild or nephew or niece — that physical and emotional wellbeing are important. Fear Free is where high tech meets high touch, where state of the art meets state of the heart. Yeah, we’ve got the science behind it, the studies behind it, but more than that, we love pets like family and we want to see them live happy, healthy, full lives.",

    "page_content": "Anyone who’s watched the 2000 cult classicBest in Showis both in awe and terrified of the dog showing world. The real-life version might not have Catherine O’Hara, Parker Posey, orBusy Bee(shame), but nonetheless, the hype is real.\nFans observe in awe as the dog handlers makeobediencelook like downright magic: With every nod of their head or sweep of their arm, the competing pup responds with an enthusiastic burst of motion or a quick halt or down. They glide together in perfect sync as the judge calls out instructions, and the small crowd gathered outside the ring quietly admires their performance. At the dramatic conclusion, the judge announces which teams qualified, and to those pairs he hands out the placement ribbons, as the audience applauds and tails wag.On the other hand (or paw) you can barely get your pup to “sit and stay.” How do those handlers get their dogs to follow their every command? It has a lot to do with their relationship with the pup. “Obedience builds confidence in the dog,” says Kate Cowles of Iowa, who competes with four shelter dogs in UKC obedience, St. Hubert’s Companion Dog Sports Program and the Association of Pet Dog Trainers’ Rally O. “For me, the point of doing competitive obedience is to build thebond.”\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nPro tips for boosting the confidence of a scaredy-cat dog.\nAt its worst, competitive obedience can look like torture for both partners. Some handlers constantly jerk at their dog’s leash or practically drag the poor thing around the ring. Other handlers become so nervous about the trial setting that they pass on that stress to their dogs, who constantly lick their lips and look for a chance to bolt.If this is your idea of obedience, then it certainly does not conjure up images of fun with your pup. But for many people, it is a favorite pastime, and their dogs enjoy the extra attention, travel, and overall excitement. Perhaps if it were called something more flashy, like “precision teamwork” or “synchronized stepping,” more dog-lovers would pursue this challenging sport and discover its many benefits.\nThe Basics of Dog Obedience\nAt its most basic,obedience trainingcomprises a variety of exercises that demonstrate controlled communication between handler and dog. Depending on the level, required skills can include sit, down, stand for exam, recall, heel, retrieve, jump, and scent. The degree of difficulty increases as you progress from one class to the next, known as Novice, Open and Utility in most venues.Today, the society’s three fundamental applications can still be found at an obedience trial, no matter what the venue. Control is exhibited at all levels of obedience, especially through heeling and the dog’s response to the handler’s verbal commands or, as they progress as a team, silent hand signals. Agility is demonstrated at the Open level by asking the dog to jump over a panel jump, broad jump and bar jump. Lastly, scent work is found at the highest level, Utility, in which the dog must find an object with his handler’s scent among a pile of articles and return with the correct one.\nThis sounds like a competition show waiting to happen.\nThe American Kennel Club (AKC) is perhaps the largest and most well-known venue for obedience andallows purebred and mixed breedsto participate in its programs. All dogs, including mixed breeds, are welcome to participate in obedience programs through the American Mixed Breed Obedience Registry (AMBOR), theAustralian Shepherd Club of America(ASCA),St. Hubert’s Companion Dog Sports Programand theUnited Kennel Club(UKC).\nEvolving Methods\nAt its earliest stages and well into the 1970s, dogs were taught obedience using punishment-avoidance techniques such as the “jerk and pull” method. People believed that if the dog experienced a negative consequence for not doing what was asked, that would be enough to create the preferred behavior. This worked for some dogs, though not all. Obedience training pioneer Terri Arnold of Massachusetts, who has earned multiple Obedience Trial Championships (OTCh) in AKC over more than 30 years, was one of the first to question and improve upon traditional training methods.In the 1970s, when Arnold started training a Shetland Sheepdog, she soon realized that choke collars, harsh commands, and withholding praise or play would not work. But, she discovered, food was an excellent motivator, and she asked her trainer if she could bring some to class. He told her she couldn’t. Her Sheltie performed wonderfully and happily at home with the food but was miserable without it in class.\nPro tips on training your dog with the click of a button — literally.\n“I decided to sneak food into class, and it fell on the floor from her mouth,” says Arnold. “The instructor started screaming at me in front of the class, and I said, ‘I don’t need this anymore.’ I turned around and walked away. I knew there had to be a better way. I will never forget that day as long as I live. It was a turning point in my whole life.”The introduction of operant conditioning andclicker trainingto competitive obedience over the past 10 years has fostered a growing movement toward more positive and motivational instruction. In his book Clicker Training for Obedience, Morgan Spector explains how operant conditioning and the use of the clicker can shape behaviors that, together, combine into a complete obedience exercise. Dogs learn step by step instead of being expected to learn an entire skill set all at once.\nThe Birth of Rally-O\nFor someone who has never shown a dog before, the formality of competitive obedience can be intimidating. With that in mind, the AKC and the Association of Pet Dog Trainers (APDT) now offer Rally-O, a more fast-paced version of traditional obedience exercises, which takes place in a relaxed, though still competitive, setting. The judge creates a course in which the handler and dog follow numbered signs and perform the exercise described at each station. Rather than standing stiff and silent, handlers may use their upper bodies and talk to their dogs for encouragement.\n5 reasons to get your dog in the agility game, from burning energy to building confidence.\n“I love Rally,” says Certified Pet Dog Trainer Diane Lavigne of New York. “I think it’s a great way for a dog to get ring experience without going into the Novice [Obedience] ring. The exercises are based on what you need to do to get a Novice title.” Lavigne also competes in UKC and AMBOR obedience with her mixed-breed Hershey, AKC obedience with her Golden Retriever Skye, and is training her young Golden, Eagle, for his competition debut.\nObedience and Rally Can be Fun\nIf you take the time to find an instructor with whom you feel comfortable, you and your dog can grow to love obedience, rally, or both. “As long as the training is not abusive, the benefits of training are immense,” says Lori Waters, whose pack includesAKC Obedience Trial Champion German Shepherd, Lou, and Border Collie, Mitch, who was the first dog in AKC history to earn Conformation Champion, Obedience Trial Champion and Champion Tracker titles.\n“Spending time together and learning to communicate with each other strengthens the dog-handler bond like nothing else can. After spending thousands of hours training, traveling thousands of miles showing — not to mention spending thousands of dollars — with my dogs, the way you both grow together is unbelievable. Your dog gets the attention and goes places that other dogs can only dream about. They get to live a very full life and the handler gets to share it.”Even if you’re not interested in competition, obedience training has value. “The obedient dog benefits,” says Arnold, “because then the dog can have a good life, a chance to run free and be a dog, whether it’s in a dog park or out in the woods somewhere. It’s the most amazing thing to me, people who let dogs free that they can’t control. Love is taking the time to train the dog to keep it safe.”",

    "page_content": "\"We adopted a young male dog from a puppy mill who is an ideal playmate for our female dog and is perfect in all ways but one: though we walk him multiple times a day, take him out after meals and pay close attention to him, he still pees in the house, and will even lift his leg on us! We’ve taken him to the vet and he received a clean bill of health. How can we stop our dog from scent marking our house — and ourselves?\"\nScent marking is a very normal and common behavior, particularly in male dogs, but it becomes a big problem when marking occurs in your house. Dogs mark to advertise their presence and to claim territory and resources. Pee and poop contain pheromones, or chemical messages, that convey information — age, gender, health, and reproductive status — about the dog doing the marking.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nResources such as toys, food bowls, chew treats, bones, and beds are the most likely objects to be marked. As you’ve experienced, a dog will also actually mark a person or something that smells heavily of that person, such as a sofa or bed.\nEven though marking can have a dominant and competitive component, it may also occur if a dog is overstimulated — for example, during or after vigorous play — orbecomes anxiousin a particular situation, such aswhen a person leaves. This common expression of anxiety in dogs is often mistaken for spite, resulting in punishment, which only serves to increase the anxious behavior. Scent marking is also more common in multi-dog households where dogs compete for space, resources, and human attention.\nKeep the faith; you can fix this pee-action.\nUnlike withsubmissive urinationwhich is typical in puppies, both sexes scent mark, but intact males are the worst offenders, as signaling sexual availability and claiming territory is “encouraged” by the presence of testosterone. In many cases, neutering can significantly reduce a dog’s desire to scent mark, but some continue even after they have been neutered.\nHow to Stop a Dog from Marking\nAlthough this is a difficult behavior to break, taking the following steps can improve the situation.\nRemove high-value resources that encourage competitive marking, and do not allow the dog or dogs who scent mark to roam freely throughout the home.\nRemove high-value resources that encourage competitive marking, and do not allow the dog or dogs who scent mark to roam freely throughout the home.\nPrevent access to favorite marking spots by restricting the dog(s) to a dog-proofed room or crate when you are unable to actively supervise them.\nPrevent access to favorite marking spots by restricting the dog(s) to a dog-proofed room or crate when you are unable to actively supervise them.\nAvoid competitive or vigorous play indoors, as excess activity encourages urination.\nAvoid competitive or vigorous play indoors, as excess activity encourages urination.\nWhencleaning up accidents, it is important to be sure that there is no underlying urine smell left.

Most dogs raised in a normal domestic situation respond well to a good house-training schedule, but those who have lived in puppy mills are notoriously difficult.\nDogs are essentially clean animals and do not like to toilet where they sleep and eat, but because puppy mill dogs are confined to cramped cages, they are forced to do just that. This makescrate training(a usually successful way to house train a dog) much less effective. However, even puppy mill dogs can be taught to toilet appropriately. You'll need to go back to house training basics. Here's how:\nAllow access to outside areas every hour, then make less-frequent trips as the dog builds up control.\nAllow access to outside areas every hour, then make less-frequent trips as the dog builds up control.\nFollow a schedule to establish a ritual of behavior, which will eventually become predictable and reliable.\nFollow a schedule to establish a ritual of behavior, which will eventually become predictable and reliable.\nThe bottom line: Every dog needs to feel confident about going to the bathroom.

Your pup might be perfect for scent tracking.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nThe Sport of Scent Tracking\nIf your dog has a nose, they have the ability to track. Surely you’ve seen them do so on walks, their nose pressed to the ground or lifted high in the air. Tracking tests harness that natural instinct by demonstrating the dog’s ability to follow one particular person’s scent — the tracklayer’s — over various kinds of terrain. Each level of competition features greater challenges such as a longer, well-aged track, more turns, and multiple scent articles.\n5 reasons to get your dog in the agility game, from burning energy to building confidence.\nUnlike agility or obedience training, where the handler gives instructions and the dog is expected to follow, with scent tracking, the dog is in charge. They wear a harness attached to a 30-foot leash and pull the handler down the trail. Some dogs are confident and fly down the track, whereas others are methodical and take their time.\nIn a tracking test, each dog receives their own track and two judges follow the dog-handler team. Putting on a tracking test is labor-intensive and requires a lot of land, so the dog must be certified prior to entry to ensure that proper training has been met.\nWhat Does a Scent Tracking Test Entail?\nThree main organizations sanction tracking tests: the American Kennel Club (AKC), the  Australian Shepherd Club of America (ASCA), and Deutscher Verband der Gebrauchshundsportvereine America (DVG America). Of the three, AKC is probably the best known, but allows only purebred dogs. Both the ASCA and DVG America welcome purebred and mixed-breed dogs.\nDepending on which venue you choose, you’ll want to find an instructor who can tailor your dog’s training to that organization’s tracking style. For example, AKC doesn’t require a dog to track with precision, meaning their nose doesn’t have to follow the track exactly, as long as they stay within 30 yards of the trail and appear to be working.\nBehavior Adjustment Training (B.A.T.) will keep your dog calm in any situation. For real.\nOn the other hand, DVG America, which offers tracking as part of its Schutzhund working dog program, requires the dog to be right on top of the trail or risk losing points. Whether you decide to track for fun or compete, the key is to be open-minded about your dog’s abilities.\nThe Three Types of Tracking Tests\nThe beginner level test, which awards the Tracking Dog (TD) title, requires a dog to follow a 440 to 500 yard-long track with three to five turns that’s been aged 30 minutes to two hours. At the end, they must indicate a scent article to the handler, such as a glove.\nThe Tracking Dog Excellent (TDX) title, the next level up, requires intermediate tracking skills. At the most advanced level, which earns the Variable Surface Tracking (VST) title, the track is 600 to 800 yards long with four to eight turns, is aged three to five hours, and covers three different ground surfaces, mimicking an urban environment.\nTo give you an idea of the degree of difficulty of these tests, AKC Field Representative Herb Morrison says the TD has a 55 to 60 percent passing rate, the TDX has a 20 percent passing rate, and the VST has a 5 percent passing rate. The rare dog who passes all three levels earns the title of a Champion Tracker (CT).\nIf your dog tries to scarf down literally everything in sight, youneedthis advice.\nElizabeth Falk and her five-year-old Bull Mastiff, Archie, recently made AKC history when he passed his TD. He became the first of his breed to earn his VCD (Versatile Companion Dog), which requires novice-level titles in agility, obedience, and tracking.\n“One of the challenges was me trusting my dog,” recalls Falk, who accidentally flunked Archie at his first tracking test. “He was trying to turn, but I thought the track went straight [and] it was a deer track. Our first trial was definitely a valuable lesson.”\nWhen it’s time to call in reinforcements.\nScent Tracking is Full of Surprises\nCarolyn Krause, author ofTry Tracking!, began training her Dalmations to track scents after a writer described the breed as “stone-nosed.” Over the past 25 years, her dogs’ multiple tracking titles have clearly proved him wrong.\n“If you have ever looked at grass with dew on it and saw all the trails from animals crossing, that gives you an idea what the world of scent shows your dog,” says Krause. “We can see it for just a few minutes. By simply taking your dog to different areas and trying things in [my] book, you can learn a lot about your dog’s personality and temperament. You don’t have to pursue a title, but you do need to make a commitment to it. You have to drive around with a ‘tracking eye’ (’Oh, there’s an interesting place!’) and wonder if your dog could follow that. It’s amazing what your dog will show you.”\nScent Tracking Resources\nFollowing Ghosts: Developing the Tracking Relationshipby Suzanne Clothier and John Rice (Flying Dog Press)\nFollowing Ghosts: Developing the Tracking Relationshipby Suzanne Clothier and John Rice (Flying Dog Press)\nFun Nosework for Dogs(2nd ed.) by Roy Hunter (Howln Moon Press)\nFun Nosework for Dogs(2nd ed.) by Roy Hunter (Howln Moon Press)\nTry Tracking!by Carolyn Krause (Dogwise.com)\nTry Tracking!by Carolyn Krause (Dogwise.com)\nAmerican Kennel Club (AKC)\nAmerican Kennel Club (AKC)\nAustralian Shepherd Club of America (ASCA)\nAustralian Shepherd Club of America (ASCA)\nDeutscher Verband der Gebrauchshund Sportvereine America (DVG America)\nDeutscher Verband der Gebrauchshund Sportvereine America (DVG America)",

He has selective hearing when it comes to responding to his name, with or without a treat. He never goes far, but he comes back to me on his own terms. How do I get Ranboo to come when I call him? — Christie\nCongratulations on your new puppy! It’s very possible to teach an old dog new tricks, but it’s ideal to start as early as possible with a young dog. This way Ranboo will be a recall pro for life. For both your safety, getting Ranboo to come when he’s called is a training must-do. As you’ve already figured out, it’s not as easy as it sounds. But with time and patience, even the most stubborn pup can learn to come when called.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nSet him up for success.\nAs with all basic training, you want to start where your dog can be successful. If you take Ranboo to the most challenging and complicated situation and ask him to learn a new skill, you’re setting him up to fail. He’s going to learn to ignore you.\nPeople will often take their dog to a dog park and start calling the dog. The dog hasn’t learned to come to you under those kind of distractions, and they ignore you. If you chase after them to try to catch them, they think it’s great fun. When they finally listen and come over to you, you might put them on a leash, tell them they’re a bad dog and leave the park. So the dog says to themself, “When I finally did listen, I lost the park.” This is a bad lesson for a dog to learn, because they won’t want to come to you if they’re going to lose out on play time.\nAnother common mistake people make is they practice thestaycommand and then call for their dog. You want to avoid this because it teaches the dog to be ready to break the stay at any moment, which doesn’t help your stay training. It also teaches the dog that they should be sitting still and staring at you before coming.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a shy pup to go from wallflower to social butterfly.\nSet up the cue and start practicing.\nA six month old dog is just starting to hit adolescence and explore their own independence. It’s easy to run into problems if you’re inconsistent with training a dog this age, so be sure to control his environment and set a consistent cue.\nYou should start inside with no distractions and high value treats. You can stand in front of Ranboo and give the cue. It’s extremely important to keep the cue the same — if you say “Ranboo, come,” for example, that has to stay your cue. Not “Ranboo,”  not “Come here, Ranboo” — it’s “Ranboo, come.” That’s it. Again, that’s just an example — choose a cue that works for you!\nMake it fun!\nSay your cue and move back a few steps. Get excited about it. Treat it as a game instead of a command.\nGive the command, move backward by three or five feet, and give your dog a high value treat when he follows. Do that around the house for a little bit. Another game you can play is if you have more than one person in the house, you can call the dog back and forth across a room and eventually do this throughout the household, in different rooms.\nYou can even turn it into a game of hide and seek. If you have a house with kids, the kids and dog will both love this. You can go around doors or duck behind the countertop and call the dog until they find you in a new space.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s pro tips for walking a pup that wantsto chase everything that moves.\nLevel-up your location.\nOnce Ranboo seems to have an understanding of the cue and he runs to you when you call him, you can go outside to a park or beach or open space. Again, don’t go straight to a dog park, because that’s a challenging environment. You want to go somewhere peaceful where a dog can be successful.\nI would invest in a 30-foot leash — or maybe 50, depending on the space you have. Bring him to a park or a basketball court where that’s not a lot going on. Put him on a long leash and let him wander and check things out at five or ten feet away from you.\nIf Ranboo is sniffing the ground ten feet away and you give a cue and he turns and pays attention, get excited. Tell him he’s good. Get low, clap your hands, run away a bit – do something excited that makes the dog want to follow you. Punctuate that with a high value reward so the dog sees that coming away from the thing he’s exploring and coming to you is where the treat is.\nOver time, you can increase the distance and increase the distraction. That might mean Ranboo is at the full length of the thirty foot leash and sniffing the grass or watching dogs play. This isn’t necessarily something you’re doing on a city street; this should be somewhere where you have control over the environment.\nFor dogs who are really strong, you should be careful with a long leash so you don’t hurt your wrist or get your legs swept out from under you. In some cases, you can tether the dog to a tree or pole to make sure you’re not going to get hurt.\nGet to the dog park.\nEventually, you can go to a dog park. Wait for the dog to have a moment when you feel that they can listen to you. For example, if I was at the park with my dog and she was engaged with three of her dog friends, I might wait a second. When she breaks off to the side to catch her breath, that’s when I would call her over to tell her she’s the best. I’d give her a treat or some water and a quick belly rub, then let her go back to play.",

    "page_content": "When I was training for a half-marathon last year, there were a lot of people I envied. I envied the runners who could finish a long run looking like something vaguely resembling a human being, while I would close out my miles looking like a wet dishrag someone had backed over with their car. I envied those who bounded up hills like gazelles, and those who could comfortably hold a conversation well into mile five. But there was one group of runners I envied above all others, a group I felt exemplified fun, fitness, and an adventurous joie de vivre that I was desperate to emulate: people who jogged with their dogs.\nRunning with your dog can be great. “It’s a bonding experience,” says Angi Aramburu, the founder ofGo Fetch Run, a fitness class for owners and their dogs. “It’s something where you can spend more time with your dog, and do something healthy and fun.”\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nBut not all humans are meant to be runners, and not all dogs are, either. My own dog, Cleo, is a decidedly indoors-y gal who glares at me if our walks go too long for her liking. Below, what you need to know if you’re considering being one of those enviable fun people who runs with their dog.\nMake Sure They’re a Breed ThatCanRun\nNot all dogs are built for endurance.Brachycephalic dogs— dogs with smushed-in noses, like pugs and bulldogs — can have difficulty breathing, and have a tendency to easily overheat. “They are not running dogs,” Aramburu explained. “They just can’t get enough oxygen to sustain them.”Even if your dog is not brachycephalic, check in with your vet to make sure they’re healthy enough to start running with you.\nA few minutes — or even a few steps — are all you need to add joy to your dog’s day.\nAlways Check the Weather\nAs disciplined and eager as you may be about running in all weather, consider whether the conditions are safe for your dog. In the hot summer months, dogs risk overheating, and hot pavement can be painful on their paws. In the winter, snow and ice can be tricky to navigate, though coats and booties can help keep them warm.\nIn an interview for Runner’s World, veterinarian, Dr. Marcia Smith, says that sore pads are an easy indicator that you’ve gone too far too fast. A gradual increase in miles will toughen up your dog’s pads, in addition to making them less susceptible to injury. Marcia stresses the importance of proper hydration and monitoring dogs for overheating even when the temperature doesn’t seem that hot. Because dogs don’t sweat, they are especially vulnerable.\nEase Them Into It\nUnless you’re a regular runner, or training for a race, most humans can’t get up one day and knock out five miles. We need practice, training, and conditioning. And so do our dogs. Aramburu recommends trying a couch-to-5K program with your dog and seeing how they respond.\n“For the first day, you might do 20 minutes where you walk for two minutes, and then jog for one minute. You’ll soon figure out what you’re able to do and what they’re able to do, and then you can go from there.”\nGet the Right Gear\nFirst and foremost, you need a leash. “Even the best trained dog can see a squirrel and run off and get hit by a car,” Aramburu says.\nA lot of runners favor a hands-free leash that wraps around their waist. Besides allowing your hands to move freely, it removes the risk of you dropping the leash mid-run. Ideally, the leash shouldn’t be much longer than four feet long — much longer than that and you risk chaos like getting the leash tangled on trees and telephone poles, and tripping up passersby — and would have bright, reflective features on it that make it visible in the dark.\nAlso, make sure you have a water bottle on hand in case your dog overheats or gets thirsty. And it’s probably a good idea to bring some poo bags with you, just to be safe.\nRemember to stay alert!\nDon’t Feed Them Right Before a Jog\nRemember when your parents told you to wait 30 minutes after eating before going in the pool? Well, that probably wasn’t necessary. But you shouldwait at least an hourafter feeding your dog before taking them on a run. Engaging in strenuous physical activity immediately after eating can cause bloating in a dog, and could lead to nausea and vomiting.\nMonitor How They’re Doing\nBecause they can’t verbally tell us when they’re feeling too hot, or tired, or achy, it’s important to keep an eye on your dog throughout the run, and watch for any signs of pain or discomfort. If your dog keeps stopping, or starts panting heavily, or looks unhappy, let them take a break. And if necessary, even if you’re just half a mile in, be willing to call it a day.\n“You have to be willing to let the dog lead,” Aramburu says.\nMake it Fun!\nSometimes, the promise of a runner’s high isn’t enough to make us lace up our shoes. We need another incentive. To make running fun for your dog, consider tacking on a fun treat for them at the end — maybe a trip to the dog park, or a visit to that place that has ice cream for dogs.\n“You can make it something your dog looks forward to,” Aramburu says. “So they know,Okay, I’m running, and I get to do this fun thing.”\nTemperatures are rising dangerously. Keep your pet safe with these tips.\nGive Them a Once-Over After the Workout\nOnce you get home, make sure your dog is doing well, and that they didn’t bring any unwanted visitors home by accident. Check their paws for any cuts, or any sticks, gravel, or seeds that might have gotten lodged in their feet, and check their body, face, and ears for any insects or debris.\nFinally, keep in mind that as long as you’re mindful about how you do it, running can be great exercise for you and your dog.\n“The most important thing is to always think of the safety and comfort of your dog first,” said Aramburu. “Sometimes people are runners and they think, Oh, I’ll get a dog to go running with me. But they don’t think about helping the dog to build up to that level. And they need to be understanding if the dog will never get to their running level. Sometimes they just won’t be the best running partner, and you love them anyway.”",

There is a simple way you can keep those four legs moving while not exhausting you, the already overworked and tired biped: Play games with your dog.\nNot only will play help yourbond grow, but regular exercise keeps your dog flexible as they age,helps control their weight, and allows them to burn off some of that excess energy. If your pup isn’t into “typical” dog stuff like fetch, running games can inspire most dogs to get moving. Here are five quick running games to play with your pup.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\n1. Chase The Person.\nThis game is simple: You run and your dog chases you. Yep, that’s it. Clap or make a “smooch” sound toget your dog’s attention, and then excitedly run away from them, so they follow you. When they’re within a few feet of you, turn and reinforce them with atreator atoy. Stopping before they reach you prevents the chase game from turning into the “nip the human on the back of the leg” game for those Heelers. One important warning:Don’tplay the “chase the dog” game — it will teach them to run away when you approach and ruin their recall.\n2. On Your Mark, Get Set, Go.\nCombine a little trick-training and self-control practice with running. You’ll need to teach your dog to associate a few of their regular basic obedience moves with new cues to do this game. Teach your dog to lie down when you say, “On your mark,” do a play bow to the signal, “Get set,” and start running when you say, “Go.” So cute.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\n3. Fartlek.\nRunners worldwide usefartlektraining to increase their speed. The wordfartlekmeans “speed play” in Swedish and refers to the practice of interspersing short bursts of speed within a training run. To play with your dog fartlek style, surge ahead of them by a few paces, and chances are your dog will happily follow your lead. Then slow down to a walk. When you’re ready, surge ahead and start over again. (And yes, even serious runners think it’s a funny word.)\n4. Hard to Get.\nThis short keep-away game can jump-start a play session. Squeak, bounce, orwave a toyaround to get your dog’s attention as you run away from them. Just make sure you don’t tease them by playing keep-away too long. The excitement created by a moment of playing hard to get can start another game, but going on too long without giving your dog access to the toy can result in frustration or anger rather than playfulness.\n5. Zig-Zag.\nPeople who are unpredictable in their movements are fascinating to dogs. With that in mind, use the “zig-zag” game to get and keep your dog’s attention. Hold a bunch ofyummy treatsto lure your dog to your side, then start moving away from them. Change speed and direction often, so they never know what you are going to do next. For example, run five steps, turn and jog slowly for 10, then execute a quick reverse and sprint in the opposite direction. Offer them praise and treats every time they’re right by your side, and keep yourself moving in various directions to keep them guessing.",

    "page_content": "Like most dog people, I do not live on a farm, nor do I have livestock, unless you count the chipmunks squatting in my garden. This is the great disappointment of my dog Peach’s life. She’ll herd anything — people, other dogs, even the cats. A Dutch Shepherd mix, no doubt she’d love to be rounding up bad guys.\nShort on both sheep and criminals, I eagerly signed us up for a Treibball (pronounced “try ball”) workshop in a suburb of Chicago. Treibball is best described as urban herding: from varying distances, you direct your dog to move large exercise balls into a goal, like herding sheep into a pen. All dogs are welcome to play, regardless of breed or age. While the distance skills and verbal cues are similar to those used in agility, Treibball makes almost no physical demands on the handler, and so people of any age and athletic ability can play.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhere Did Treibball Come From?\nTreibball, also known as drive-ball or push ball, originated in Germany in 2005 when Dutch dog trainer Jan Nijboer watched his Australian Cattle Dogs push their rubber water dishes around the field after finishing herding lessons. The dogs, who clearly still had energy to spare, had created their own game. He wondered if they would also push large exercise balls, and found that they easily took to the new “sheep.”\nAfter Nijboer introduced the game to his herding students, it quickly spread across Europe and then to the United States. In 2007, Sweden hosted the inaugural international Treibball competition. American Treibball Association (ATA) founder Dianna Stearns first saw drive-ball videos in 2009. As a positive-reinforcement trainer, she appreciated Nijboer’s emphasis on a respectful relationship between dog and handler. “I could see it being used as a positive teaching tool,” says Stearns. “[It’s] fun, fosters a stronger bond without corrections or punishment, [and] improves communication skills and enhances a dog’s off-leash reliability.\nAnother group,National Association of Treibball Enthusiasts, promotes Treibball as a fun and safe yet challenging sport for all dogs and handlers. Launched in 2010, they endorse “dog-friendly training techniques that support the best qualities of the human/canine relationship.”\nThis sounds like a competition show waiting to happen.\nHow Can Treibball Keep Your Pup Occupied?\n“As a trainer and behavior consultant, a lot of the behavior problems I’m asked to address stem from the sad effects of dogs who are bored … who are expected to simply lie [around] while their ownerswatch TV,” says Stearns. “Most dogs are problem solvers. They need an outlet for their intelligence and energy before it gets funneled into destructive chewing, digging, barking, and fence running.” Stearns has enjoyed the challenge of Treibball with herown dogsincluding a Border Collie/Aussie mix who, she jokes, is “currently suffering fromteenage brain.”\n“[My dogs] have different approaches to the balls and to the game,” says Stearns. “I’ve had to adapt my training to each of their different learning styles. Because Treibball is a problem-solving game [in which the handler directs] the dog to go after a specific ball depending on where that ball rolls, both handler and dog must continually correct their positioning. It’s been a major problem-solving exercise in creative thinking and teaching.”\nThat was certainly the case when Peach and I followed our Treibball instructor’s directions. Since we have competitive agility and disc dog backgrounds, the verbal and physical cues I used were different than those suggested in class. I made some adjustments and decided how to match up cues Peach already knew with the various Treibball maneuvers. Peach took it all in stride, eager to work on “sends” to her mat from 15 feet away and down on command at varying distances, and to target various objects — even a toy dump truck! — in preparation for our first ball.\nWe both pouted when we realized we wouldn’t get a ball right away, but like any canine sport, it’s important to master foundation skills first. Also, Peach habitually retrieves her target with her mouth, which is frowned upon in Treibball. A dog who bites the ball will be eliminated; driving must be done with the nose only.\n5 reasons to get your dog in the agility game, from burning energy to building confidence.\nWhy High-Energy Dogs Are a Good Fit\nTreibball is a great solution forhigh-energy dogswhose pet parents cannot match their activity level. Our sedentary lifestyles are often at odds with the level of high activity that helps dogs thrive. Most dogs would love a job, and a thinking job or game that increases their bond with their person is a natural fit. Whether you pursue Treibball competitively or recreationally, suburban and city dogs will enjoy the physical and mental stimulation of tending to their inflatable ball flock.",

But as adorable as it sounds, two puppies at the same time is A LOT of work. Take heart, though: the problems you may encounter — feeling overwhelmed by double the training, for example — are common in households with two puppies, and you can definitely make the situation better.\nThe most important step is to spend time alone with each puppy daily. Besides helping you build a strong relationship with each of the dogs, this will also accustom them to being separated. Use this one-on-one time to work on training. The pups need to be trained individually before you try to work with them as a pair, because they are going to distract one another when they’re together.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents.

Perhaps one loves nothing more than to have you practicecanine massageon him, while the other pup’s favorite activity is running and jumping in the water.\nIt is wise to let them be individuals; living in the same house does not mean that they necessarily have identical personalities or that they have the same needs.

    "page_content": "Having a dog gives you a sense of connection to other dog people in your community, but not all pet-parent passers by have the same goal — whether it’s to make friends along the way or just let their dog do their business and rush home. If dog walking is a social activity for you but less-than-enthusiastic neighbors are curbing your enthusiasm, you may be committing a canine etiquette faux pas. Everyone walks their dogs in their own ways for their own reasons, and following these ground rules will help you stay on good terms with your neighbors and fellow dog owners.\n1. Use a leash\nThis is a cardinal rule. If you are not in an off-leash area,such as a dog park, you shouldalwayshave your dog on a leash during your walk. While your dog may have excellent recall, there’s no telling what might trigger them to bolt or involve them in a contentious situation with either another dog or a person. At the end of the day, not everyone wants to be approached by your dog, no matter how cute they are. Keeping them on leash is an easy way to maintain peace. (Recall training is best done in a contained area such as your backyard or a dog park, places that offer space without the risk of cars, joggers, orevil mailmen.)\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nAnd why you shouldn’t skip the longer routes.\n2. Be respectful\nThis goes for people and property alike. When it comes to other people, don’t let your dog run up to or jump on them — it’s kinda rude. Also, refrain from clotheslining your fellow pedestrians: Keep your dog close so others can pass you without fear of falling. And while we understand how specific dogs can be about where they potty, keep them off neighborhood lawns. Landscaping is expensive and time-consuming, and dog pee is a lawn killer.\n3. Pick up your dog’s poop\nSeriously. Just do it. It’s not fertilizer; it’s damaging to the environment and nobody wants to step in it. People who fail to pick up after their dogs give all of us a bad name. Don’t be that person.\n4. Be cognizant\nYou are responsible for your dog, so be aware of their behavior and interactions. If they’re jumpy, gets in another dog’s face,barksor wraps their leash around others, stop them.Know when a situation is getting unfriendlyand act accordingly. Basically, when it comes to being social, try to keep other people’s prerogatives in mind. Don’t let your dog approach other dogs while they are eliminating — it’s distracting for the dog and frustrating for the owner, who’s no doubt keen on their dog completing this function. Keep meet-and-sniffs brief, and don’t take it personally when people keep their pace, since you don’t know what kind of schedule they’re on.\nWhile walking your dog might not be the time to socialize, there are other places to mingle with fellow dog lovers. Keep on keeping on, social butterfly — just keep your dog on a leash.",

With all that upside, who wouldn’t want to take their pup to the office?\nBut let’s be real. Not allpeopleare well-behaved in the office (looking at you, clips-your-fingernails-at-your-desk guy). So we can’t expect dogs to be perfect, either. Fear not. We checked in withRobert Haussmann, certified dog trainer, co-founder ofDogboy NYC, andWildestCollective member, for advice on setting your dog up for a stellar performance review.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nBe Realistic About Your Dog\nYou know your dog. And you know your office. Before taking your pup to work, try to imagine how they might react in that specific environment. Says Haussmann, “If you know your dog has issues with other dogs or people, they’re not a good fit for the office. Or maybe your dog is really hyper and always getting into stuff at home. If they can’t be calm at home, they’re going to have a tough time being calm at an office filled with distractions and temptations.” Also, make sure your pup is rock-solid in thepotty trainingdepartment. Cute dogs can get away with almost anything — except peeing on your co-worker’s laptop bag.\nTeach Your Pup to Chill\nWhile you’re expected to work hard when you’re at the office, your dog’s primary assignment will be to kick back and relax. If your dog’s previous outings have been trips to thedog parkordoggie daycare, they may assume every place they go is meant for fun. That could make for a rude awakening when they get to the office and their human is sitting at a desk ignoring them when all they want (and expect) to do is play. Haussmann recommends getting your dog in the habit of settling down at home before you attempt a trip to the office.\n“You want your dog to have rituals around going to a place for quiet time. Get them comfortable taking a nap in a crate, or teach them to do a down/stay by your feet while you’re reading on the couch. Then start introducing more and more stimulus, so they get used to settling when activities are happening around them.” If your dog can stay while you do ayogaclass or invite friends over, they’ll stand a better chance of handling the commotion of the office.\nJune 25th is Take Your Dog to Work Day. From reducing stress to improving morale, here’s why pet-friendly offices are where it’s at.\nPractice Real-life Scenarios\nBasic obedienceandsocializationare musts for any future office dog. But they have to be able to apply their skills in the real world, not just during focused training sessions. “Dogs need context,” says Haussmann. “It’s great if your dog can stay when you hold your hand up and walk backward slowly, but that’s not really going to help in an office situation. They need to know ‘settle’ when a delivery person is unloading packages or ‘drop it’ when they retrieve your co-worker’s half-eaten sandwich from the garbage can. And if you have your own office, they need to be comfortable with people passing by or coming into your space.”\nTo get your dog prepped, simulate likely scenarios before taking them to work. For example, if you’ll need to leave your pup alone for short periods while you attend meetings, tether your dog in one room while you go work in another, so they get comfortable having you out of sight. Or, if you have an open-concept office, try taking your dog to an outdoor cafe while you catch up on email. That will help them get used to hanging out by your side in a busier environment.\nSet Your Dog Up For Success in the Office\nSome dogs may be able to handle having free rein at the office. But most will benefit from being confined — at least until they can be trusted to make good doggie decisions. Keeping your dog on a leash at your desk or in apuppy penwill allow them to see what’s happening around them while also keeping them out of trouble. And make sure they have an assortment of toys, chews, orinteractive puzzlesto keep them occupied throughout the day.\nAccording to Haussman, “Even a well-trained dog is going to struggle if they haven’t had their energy needs met, or they are under-stimulated.” Help your dog out by exercising them throughout the day and providing plenty of environmental enrichment to keep them from getting bored.\nIn 2024, the only job worth having is one that lets you bring your dog to the office.\nPay Attention to Your Dog’s Body Language\nSometimes dogs get overwhelmed by new activities or surroundings, so keep an eye on your dog and look for signs that tell you how they’re feeling throughout the day. “Not all dog body language is obvious,” says Haussmann. “Brush up on common signs ofanxiety,fear, and aggression. If your dog seems uncomfortable, try to figure out what’s making them feel that way so you can avoid those situations.”\nFinal Words of Wisdom\n“Don’t over or under think it,” says Haussmann. “Have a plan. Stay calm. And try to see the world from your dog’s perspective.” Lastly, don’t be bummed if your dog isn’t an ideal candidate for office life. Just because they’re not a good fit now doesn’t mean they never will be. Your dog may just need some more socialization,training, or time to mature into the Very Good Boy you know he can be.\nGet your fix of Kinship\nWe promise not to send you garbage that turns your inbox into a litter box.

    },
    "page_content": "There are many tricks you can teach your dog: sit, shake, lie down. But if you really want your pup to shine (or become a TikTok sensation), you’llteach them to skateboard. While that may seem cute, if absurd, it’s actually pretty doable. Certain canines, such asBulldogs, are naturals when it comes to the sport due to their low centers of gravity. But evenlarger breeds(if they can fit on the boards) can be denizens of Dogtown.\nAll you have to do is familiarize your pet with the unique sensation of standing on the deck, then gently introduce them to movement. The chances are slim that they’ll be doing ollies from there, but they will love the mix of positive reinforcement and breeze in their faces. Meanwhile, you’ll enjoy the satisfaction of sticking it to all other parents at the dog park. Everyone wins!\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nFive steps to teach your dog to ride a skateboard.\nThis step is critical, and I recommend doing it slowly. Rushing it will slow down your eventual success. Start by rewarding your dog for putting one paw on the board while it is secured with a piece of wood or with your foot acting as a brake. If the board is adjustable, start with the board tightened so it can’t rock back and forth. Ideally, the board shouldn’t move while the dog gets accustomed to it. Later, as your dog gets more comfortable, reward your dog for putting two paws on the board and so forth.\nOnce your dog is comfortable fully standing on the board with all four paws, the next step is to get them comfortable with the movement. Start by moving the board with your dog comfortably on it just a few inches and then a little bit more at a time. Only allow the board to move slowly. If possible, you should take advantage of opportunities to reinforce your dog for having all four paws on the skateboard and for letting it move with one paw hopping along behind.\nReward your dog for pushing the board with one or both back paws. These pushes are critical for having a dog propel the skateboard for any distance rather than just passively riding a board you have set in motion.\nAs your dog picks up the skill and is more comfortable with pushing the board, you’ll work on speed and duration. At this point, you’ll wait longer before reinforcing them. Some dogs may not enjoy the increased speed or riding it for longer periods of time. Stay within your dog’s comfort zone.\nSlowly loosen the board so that it rocks back and forth (necessary for steering) and go through the entire process with the board at each one of these settings. You can then reinforce the dog for steering, which is accomplished by shifting their weight to one side or the other as they ride.\nConsider your dog’s skill, physical limitations, and interest level.\nThe dogs in these videos are very experienced and highly skilled, but few dogs will attain that level of success at skateboarding. Always keep in mind what your dog can comfortably do so that you don’t put them in a situation that is over their head. Stick to smooth surfaces, keep them away from roads and other dangers, and don’t send them down a hill of any kind, no matter how mild, until they’re ready.\nJust as in people, some dogs are athletic, fearless, and adventurous enough that skateboarding comes fairly naturally to them. Other dogs may never reach true proficiency at it but might enjoy skateboarding very slowly for brief periods. There are also dogs who are clearly not suited to this activity, and if that’s the case for your dog, do not even consider attempting to teach them to ride.",

      "title": "Does Your Dog Have Therapy Dog Potential?",
      "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/dog-assisted-therapy"
    },
    "page_content": "I wish I could say I’m making this up but I once had a client tell me, “My dog would be perfect as a therapy dog — perfect. You just have to help me stop him from biting so much.” He had the best of intentions, but his pathologically shy and potentially dangerous dog was no better suited to therapy work than I am to being a ballerina.\nNumerous studies have shown the physical and emotionalhealth benefits of dogs. Therapy dog work brings those amazing benefits to vulnerable folks in hospitals and senior centers, and it makes my heart all warm and gooey to think of the great work they do. Currently, an estimated 30,000 teams of therapy dogs and handlers are certified throughPet PartnersandTherapy Dogs International, and there is little doubt that they are enriching the lives of thousands of people across the country.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nWhat do therapy dogs do?\nA good dog-and-handler team does a lot more than just make people feel fleetingly happy. True therapy dogs — dogs who participate in structured programs designed by health care professionals (Animal-Assisted Therapy, or AAT) — can decrease pain, improve mobility, speed up post-surgery healing and even calm autistic children as well as increase their social interactions. That’s a pretty impressive body of work, and it is just the shortlist.\nA larger number of dogs and handlers participate in work called Animal-Assisted Activities (AAA), in which teams visit hospitalized children and senior-center residents. The petting, tricks and furry companionship can stimulate the release of massive quantities of the world’s greatest drug, the neurohormoneoxytocin.\nThis work can be as good for the handlers as the recipients. Watching a senior citizen glow while petting your dog is guaranteed to put you in a good mood that lasts for hours. But, you need to leave your rose-colored glasses at home if you and your dog are involved in therapy work (I’m just going to loosely call it “therapy” from now on). Just because you love your dog doesn’t mean everyone in a nursing home will want to meet them. Plus, your dog may actually hate the work, even though it wraps you in a haze of oxytocin. Or, your pup may come home with antibiotic-resistant bacteria likeMRSA, which is commonly found in healthcare facilities.\nIn other words, there’s a lot to learn about doing this work in a way that is truly helpful to others, safe for everyone involved, and, as importantly, enjoyable for your dog. Although therapy animals come in all shapes and sizes, I’ll be focusing on dogs in this article because they pretty much drive the system.\nExperts share the science-backed ways our pets offer us emotional support.\nWhat makes a good therapy dog?\nLet’s start with a question: Which dogs are appropriate for therapy dog work? Answer: Not many. Ouch. Sorry, but the fact is that therapy work can be tiring and stressful for many dogs, and some dogs have personalities that take them out of the running even though they would love to be on the team.\nAnoverexuberant dogmight make a good therapy dog when they’re a senior, but as an adolescent, they might simply be too much “dog” to visit vulnerable populations. Imagine a dog with good manners that keeps all four feet on the ground, but in their enthusiasm to meet new people, they quiver and lick and thrash their tail around like some crazed dishrag on drugs. It’s a good reminder that no matter how much you love your dog, they may not be a candidate for therapy work, at least not now.Here are some criteria to consider when asking if your dog is suitable for therapy work:\nTherapy dogs must love people and human contact.\nTherapy dogs must love people and human contact.\nTherapy dogs must be emotionally calm and at ease in all situations.\nTherapy dogs must be emotionally calm and at ease in all situations.\nTherapy dogs must be physically calm with good manners and an appropriate personality.\nTherapy dogs must be physically calm with good manners and an appropriate personality.\nThe most important job qualification is that your dog loves people, absolutely and completely. That doesn’t mean your pup lights up when you come home and tolerates visitors. I’ve seen and heard of numerous dogs in training for therapy dog work who adored their person — but strangers? Not so much. I’ve also watched a dog and handler spend an entire “therapy” session bonding with one another in a nursing home. That’s not therapy; that’s a pet parent petting their dog while others watch. It might be useful in some circumstances, but most often, the dog needs to voluntarily approach strangers, make eye contact with them, and put forth an effort to get close to them.\nIt’s important to distinguish these dogs from dogs who merely tolerate strangers. My dog’s response to people walking toward the house is: “Oh, look! There’sanotherone! Can you believe it?” I get the impression he thinks that people are as rare as huge, juicy beef bones, and he just can’t believe his luck — they keep turning up randomly when he least expects them. So while he’d fill the “loves everyone” bill, he’d, uh, most likely knock an elderly person out of their wheelchair with his tail.\nThis brings us to the difference between manners and personality. Your dog might greet people politely withgood manners, but you can’t expect them to leave their personality in the crate. Therapy dogs need to be calm — dogs who don’t slap senior citizens with their tails or pull IVs out of patients’ arms. The level of acceptable activity can vary depending on where and when the dog is working, but a calm demeanor goes beyond good training.\nPeople who most benefit from a dose of oxytocin are often frail or otherwise physically compromised, and the dogs they interact with can’t emote all over them, forcing them to protect their face or their shoulder or their new hip. This is one reason so many dogs do well when they are older, even though they may have flunked the certification test when they were younger. If your dog was dismissed as too active to work in the Children’s Hospital when he was three, you might want to try again when he’s eight or ten, after he’s slowed down and is a little calmer about life in general.\nBesides being physically calm, dogs need to be emotionally calm. That means they don’t go all pancake-eyed when someone grabs their head or panic if a metal tray is dropped behind them. Essentially, a good therapy dog needs to behave in ways that most dogs don’t: unfazed when a child hugs them a little too hard before you can intervene, unreactive when the Alzheimer’s patient tries to grab their ears, and screams when you step in.\nCan somenervous dogsbe conditioned to be comfortable when “life happens”? Yes, they can; I know of several dogs who were originally terrified of strangers and ended up as great therapy dogs. But that’s the exception, not the rule. It’s a fool’s errand to try to make areactive doginto a good therapy dog while they’re in treatment themselves, and it’s not safe or respectful to anyone to try to make a “regular” dog into a one-in-a-million one.\nThis is a problem I’ve seen a bit too often: pet parents whose dogs may have good reasons for being cautious or nippy but who still insist that “it’s not the dog’s fault, and if everyone would just learn to be appropriate around dogs, they’d be perfect.” That’s pretty much the point here: people won’t be perfect, guaranteed. In the normal run of things, they never are, and in the case of therapy, they often will be worse. The children will be crazed to finally see a dog like the one they have at home—they won’t understand why they can’t hug your dog so hard that your pup can’t breathe. Some seniors will sit quietly stroking your dog, but others will get a death grip on the sides of the dog’s head and kiss their lips before you can stop them.\nFor everyone’s sake, including your own, you don’t want a therapy dog that just barely tolerates this kind of treatment. Those dogs may be “fine” (i.e., they don’t bite) the first time or two, but they might not be the third or fourth. Even if they don’t object, forcing them to tolerate this sort of behavior could be considered abusive. You need a dog who really, truly doesn’t care if they’re hugged, or their tail is pulled. Those dogs are out there, but they are less common than many of us like to think.\nResponsibilities of Therapy Dog Handlers\nAnd that brings us to another critical issue: your responsibility as your dog’s handler. Here are a few responsibilities as a handler for therapy dog work.\nBe your dog’s advocate.\nBe your dog’s advocate.\nBe able to read your dog’s body language.\nBe able to read your dog’s body language.\nBe objective.\nBe objective.\nAlthough I’ve already noted that a therapy dog must be able to tolerate all manner of rudeness, it’s your job to eliminate as much stress as you possibly can. You may not be able to do this 100 percent of the time (thus my cautions about your dog’s training and personality), but as the human half of the team, you play several roles, and one of them is to be your dog’s advocate. This includes knowing your dog well enough to predict which environment they would do well.\nSome dogs, for example, would be overstimulated in a room full of children but might be great for a senior facility. Some dogs adore kids but would be nervous around wheelchairs and walkers. Thus, your first job is to find out which program is a good fit for your dog. If you’re involved with a group like Pet Partners or Therapy Dogs International, the organization will help you identify an appropriate venue after your dog has been certified.\nOnce you’re on location, your task is to present your dog to others and then back off enough to encourage connections. However, you need to stay alert and watch for potentially inappropriate interactions. Most importantly, you need to be an expert at reading your dog. If I’ve heard “Oh, they’re fine,” about a stiff-bodied, closed-mouthed, wrinkled-brow dog once, I’ve heard it a gazillion times.\nA woman sent me a video of her and her dog doing therapy work in a hospital setting. The children were in heaven, petting and stroking and chattering like starlings over the dog. The woman was beaming and raved to me about how much her dog loved the work. Except that’s not what her dog’s body language suggested. He looked patently miserable, with astiff body, his mouth closed and his head turned away from the children. His human was so overwhelmed with oxytocin herself that she couldn’t see that her dog was extremely uncomfortable.\nTherapy dog handlers need to become brilliant at interpreting visual signals of discomfort in their dog and learning to act on them immediately. That’s not always so easy to do; many of us have seen a suspicious look on our dog’s face and dismissed it. “Oh, but they’ve always loved coming here.” But maybe that was then, and this is now. Therapy work can be the highlight of a dog’s week, but it can also be stressful, and it’s common for dogs to enjoy it for a few years and then be ready for retirement.\nWhat’s most important is learning to read your dog objectively and to do so every minute of every interaction. If you’re participating in therapy dog work with your dog, you are the responsible member of a team, and you need to watch and evaluate the patient, the surroundings, and your dog. If you don’t come home a little tired, you’re probably not doing your job.\nArgh! This sounds like a lot. It is if you do it right, that’s true. However, many people say it’s the most rewarding thing they’ve ever done with their dog. I don’t want these cautions to discourage anyone from doing therapy work with their dog. This can be important and wonderful work — good for you, good for your dog, and good for people desperate for the same glow you get when you cuddle with your dog at night. Spreading joy is a beautiful thing — but it needs to be done with knowledge and foresight so that it’s a win for everyone.\nTherapy Dogs Today: Their Gifts, Our Obligation(Funpuddle Publishing, 2013).\nTherapy Dogs Today: Their Gifts, Our Obligation(Funpuddle Publishing, 2013).\nThe Handbook on Animal-Assisted Therapy: Theoretical Foundations and Guidelines for Clinical Practice(Elsevier Science, 2010).\nThe Handbook on Animal-Assisted Therapy: Theoretical Foundations and Guidelines for Clinical Practice(Elsevier Science, 2010).\nAnimals in Our Lives; Human-Animal Interaction in Family, Community & Therapeutic Settings(Paul H.

Following nine seasons as the character and a seemingly endless stream of memeable lines, he’s now helping other adorable doofuses shine in the form of dog dancing. Yep, it’s a thing — and thanks to Wilson’sWe Are the Champions, it’s quickly growing in popularity. The Netflix series documents niche sports — including competitive dog dancing.\n“This is like a real-life ‘Best in Show’ where the stakes are as high as you could possibly imagine,” Rainn Wilson said in an interview withVariety. “When you watch them compete, you’re like, ‘This is ridiculous,’ but then you go, ‘This is beautiful.’”\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nWhile you might still be figuring outhow to get your dog’s attention, these enthusiastic pet parents have their pups grooving to “Tones and I’s Dance Monkey” with elaborate dance routines. Dog dancing, also known as canine freestyle, is choreographed trick training set to music. You’ll recognize some traditionalobedience moves, such as heel position, but the overall goal is to get creative and put your dog’s best paw forward. Fans of the sport love the freedom of choosing their own music, designing a routine based on their dog’s strengths, and using verbal encouragement during a performance.\nHow Did “Dog Dancing” Begin?\nJoan Tennille, president and co-founder of theCanine Freestyle Federation (CFF)claims that she defined canine freestyle as a competitive sport rather than just entertainment. In 1993, four dog trainers approached Tennille — at the time, a professional dancer-choreographer — to help them create what would be the first canine freestyle demo. They wanted to showcase their dogs’ advanced obedience training by setting it to music while treating both humans and dogs as equal partners. They showed her a video of a demonstration by a now-defunct Canadian organization.“There was a woman in high heels and stockings doing ballet with a Golden Retriever,” says Tennille. “There were so many sequins and ruffles, you couldn’t even see the dog, and all the dog did was sit. Another woman had a well-trained Border Collie, but she had heavy sequins and balloons, so again, you couldn’t see the dog. I call that entertainment. That’s not what they wanted.”Aside from the challenge of giving the dog equal stage presence, Tennille had to think about movement and flow. Four-footed dogs move very differently from two-footed people. Plus, a Border Collie is going to be more agile and light on their feet than a Bloodhound. The demo proved successful, andCanine Freestyle Federationwas born two years later. It remains the oldest active canine freestyle organization and is best known for what Tennille calls “performance attitude.”\nIn 1999, theWorld Canine Freestyle Organization(WCFO) made its debut and began offering worldwide competitions the following year. TheMusical Dog Sport Association(MDSA) was then founded in 2002. Its website is a treasure trove for beginners, featuring resources such as a comprehensive (and ever-evolving) list of dog dancing moves and advice on how to find a good canine freestyle trainer. MDSA also recognizes freestyle teams that perform at hospitals, schools, and nursing homes through its Spirit of Sharing program. Since freestyle classes are not available in some areas, MDSA’s Circle of Friends program is a great way for members to meet and train with freestylers in their area.\nCanine Freestyle Competitions and Routines\nEach organization promotes its own style and hallmarks of competition. As you progress from one level to another, you’re required to perform longer, more challenging routines. Unlike dogs in many other sports, freestyle dogs must focus on their partner for a minimum of 90 seconds and up to three minutes at the most advanced levels. The key is a strong bond and positive training using motivational methods — you really can’t make a dog do freestyle; it’s all about therelationship.\nAlthough most of the top competition dogs areBorder Colliesand Golden Retrievers, all breeds and mixes are welcome to participate, no matter the organization. Karen Lewis of New Mexico competes in WCFO and MDFA with her six-year-old Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Bryce, who also competes inagility.\n“The bond is even more important in freestyle,” says Lewis. “In agility, you pretty much do those obstacles the same way. In freestyle, you’re always doing new moves. The dog has to pay attention to you constantly to get the cues, either verbal or physical. Since you’re supposed to keep up, you’re constantly thinking,What am I doing now? When am I going to say it?It’s amazing what can go on during a one-and-a-half-minute routine.”\nWhether you are ready to boost your dog training to the next level, want to build that bond with your pup, or just want to peep at some mesmerizing outfits and top-notch dog training, “dog dancing” might just be what you’re looking for.",

He's a very big dog, with a big bark! Once the leash is on, he takes it in his mouth and jumps all over the place. Walking is also a challenge because he’s always trying to grab the leash. Any suggestions?\nThat sounds hectic! It’s no fun walking a dog who seems to be on a pogo stick and is grabbing at the leash to boot. When another dog is along (no matter how well behaved), it can feel even that much crazier.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nIt’s a common scene — your dog’s hyped to go on a walk but once the leash is on, they take it in their mouth andjump all over the place. It can be frustrating and makewalking a challengebecause they’re always trying to grab the leash. When another dog comes along, no matter how well-behaved,it can feel even crazier. This hectic dance takes all the fun —and many of the benefits— out of dog walking. But it doesn’t have tostall all attemptsto venture outside with your pup.\nThere are definitely things you can do to makethese outingsbetter for everyone. One of the best ways to keep the leash out of the dog’s mouth is to give them something else to put in it — say, a toy they can carry. If their mouth is occupied, they’ll be less likely to be interested in grabbing the leash.\nDog trainer Karen B. London promises you’re not doomed to be pulled down the street forever.\nHowever, you may have to experiment a bit to find something they like better than they like to bite the leash. Safety is the primary consideration, but beyond that, let the dog’s interests guide you, while making sure the item is too large for them to choke on it. Good options include a ball, rope tug toy, fleece animal, or flying disc. Many dogs will happily carry a stick, but sticks can be dangerous due to splinters and mouth and throat punctures. If your dog is a true stick lover, try a toy designed to mimic one. For example,Konghas a few longer heavy-duty options for many stick-loving dogs.\nThis potential solution may seem overly simple, but don’t let that stop you from giving it a try. Many dogs get super amped up about going for a walk, and when they’re in that state, they become very mouthy, and the leash is right there. By providing the dog with an outlet for their need to grab something, you’re allowing them to give in to their urge without driving you insane — it may just solve the problem.",

    "page_content": "Over the years, you’ll begin to notice a few changes to your dog beyond a greying muzzle. In their senior years, many dogs have issues that impact their physical abilities, whether due to arthritis, illness, or just because they are small and have trouble keeping up. Even when challenging to do so, it’s great to get out walking with your dog every day. The sights, smells, sounds, and tastes of the world activate the brain, so walks — even in a stroller — are a great way to keep your dog mentally fit.\nYour dog might not initially like their stroller; that’s why you’ll need to work on training and slow introductions to their new wheels. With a bit of practice (and some patience), most dogs will eventually enjoy taking a ride in a pet stroller because it means they get to go out. There’s no better reward than a long walk to take in the smells.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nPet parents of senior dogs often find themselves asking, “How do you train your dog to use a pet stroller?” As with all dog training, the most important things to remember are taking it slow, making it positive, and working with your dog’s abilities. Of course, like many necessary challenges — it might be easier with a friend or partner.\nHow to Teach Your Dog to Ride in a Stroller\nFor many dogs, strollers can be scary because they are large and new. But this is a critical step, and I recommend doing it slowly. Bring the stroller somewhere your dog can easily investigate it, and be sure to lock the wheels so it doesn’t suddenly move.If your dog seems uncomfortable around the stroller, you can put treats near or around the stroller to get your dog to move closer and closer to it.\nIf your dog remains relaxed and calm near the stroller, you can also reward them with a few treats to ensure they maintain a positive experience. If your dog seems skittish or unsure, move farther away from the stroller until they are relaxed, then reward with treats (or a toy). Your goal here is to work towards the stroller slowly. Again, don’t rush this.\nGet your fix of Kinship\nWe promise not to send you garbage that turns your inbox into a litter box.

If your dog remains calm, reward them with a few treats. Just as suggested before, if your dog is timid, you’ll need to move farther away until your dog is comfortable and try again. The goal here will be to ensure your dog has a positive experience with the moving stroller.\nNow that your dog is happy in the presence of a stroller, you can pick them up and put them in. For larger dogs too heavy to be picked up, you can lure them into the stroller. Once your dog is in the stroller, offer treats. If your dog finds the experience scary or unpleasant, stop and try again later, working your way up to this point. You may want to do this several times over multiple daysbefore ever even moving them in the stroller. You can even let them eat a yummy chew while hanging out in the stationary stroller.\nIf your dog remains happy with all the previous steps, push the stroller around a bit with them inside while providing treats and praise often. If they remain calm and relaxed, feel free to continue but keep an eye on their stress levels. For timid dogs, take this step slowly.\nOnce your dog has a positive experience at home, take this show on the road. Start by choosing locations with few distractions that may cause unneeded stress. Now it’s time to get moving with your dog. While out on your next stroller walk, be sure to bring your dog’s collar and leash. Periodically stop to let your pup out to walk, stretch their legs and get a closer sniff. When they’ve tired themselves out, allow them back in the stroller for a cozy ride home.\nRemember, when it comes to pet training, choose the methods that help your dog succeed. Always focus on positive reinforcement to encourage training and resist attempts to force them to move quicker than they are ready. Above all, enjoy it — stroller rides should be fun for both dogs and their humans.\nRecommendations for Best Dog Strollers\nDog strollers are useful for traveling with your pet.

What makes this dog stroller unique is that it serves both as a stroller and as a bicycle trailer attachment. The water-resistant, durable canopy features a zipped rear door for easy entry. With large 20” air-filled tires, your pup will be sure to have a smooth ride.\nWhich is The Best Stroller for Your Dog?\nBecause there are so many strollers available on the market, it might be a bit difficult finding the right stroller for you and your dog. You’ll need to consider what you’re planning on using the stroller for, your dog’s size, physical ability, and behavior. Here are a few things to think about when deciding on a pet stroller.\nMany dog strollers are geared towards small breed dogs (those less than 25 lbs.), so if your pup is a medium or large dog, your options will be more limited. Carriage-style strollers are more common for smaller dogs, whereas for larger dogs, you’re more likely to find a wagon.\nIf your dog is uh... not the mellow type, or maybe freaks out when they see squirrels, then you’ll want to make sure your stroller of choice has a sturdy leash clip for your pup’s harness — you’ll also need plenty of stroller training. Having a durable zipper enclosure might help too.\nTaking a stroll around the block on the pavement will be okay for a hard plastic wheel, but larger air-filled wheels will work better for smoothing out a rough ride on the trail or during a jog.\nYou might be looking for a cheap stroller, but if you plan to use your stroller often and for more than a couple of months, look into getting a quality, sturdy, durable pet stroller to ensure your pet’s safety and comfort.\nIf your dog is recovering from surgery, has arthritis, or has other mobility issues having a stroller with a low profile or an ease-of-access step could be a helpful addition — especially for large dogs. Keep an eye out for other convenience items like storage compartments, pockets, or one-handed closures.",

    "page_content": "One second your pup is demonstrating the perfect sit, the next they seem like they’re going to swallow your whole hand along with the treat you promised them. Experiences with overly enthusiastic treat takers are universal. But some dogs are only “chompy” when revved up, so this can be a good assessment tool — in these cases, the intensity of the alligator-like behavior can indicate a dog’sarousal level. Some dogs seem to naturally take treats gently, but most need lessons to achieve this skill, which starts by teaching your dog the cue “gentle.” Having a dog who does this can relieve much of the conflict-induced frustration that occurs when you want to reinforce your dog’s good behavior but also want your fingers to remain intact and connected to your body.\nTeach “Gentle” to a Dog\nAvoid confusion by teaching the cue “Gentle” as its own behavior rather than during a training session for some other behavior. Commit to the idea that your dog needs to take the treats gently or they don’t get them at all. In other words, don’t allow the snapping behavior to be rewarded.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nTo teach your dog what “Gentle” means, hold a treat in your hand, close your fist around it and offer it to your dog. If your dog bites at your hand, keep it closed; this means either toughing it out or wearing gloves, depending on your dog’s behavior and your tolerance. When they stop biting and lick your hand (or even nibbles gently and painlessly), say “Gentle” and open your hand completely to give them the treat.\nKeep saying “Gentle” each time you offer your pup a treat to help them associate the word with the behavior. If they have a relapse and return to their former finger-gnawing ways, pull your hand away and then offer the treat again, using the cue “Gentle” to remind them of what you want. This will keep you from dropping the treat in response to the snapping.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nHow to Protect Your Fingers\nUntil your dog knows how to take treats gently, there are a couple of ways to protect your fingers when giving treats outside of training sessions. At home, put cream cheese or peanut butter on a wooden spoon and offer your dog a chance to lick this food a few times. This is a way to reinforce your dog without putting your hands near her mouth.\nIn a dog park or class setting, offer the treat on your flat palm. Many dogs who will snap at treats held in the fingertips are able to take them properly when they are presented on an open hand. A final option is to drop the treats on the ground rather than giving them directly to the dog.\nIt takes a lot of repetition for most pups to learn to take treats gently, and the occasional effort to teach someone else’s dog by, for example, holding them in your closed hand is unlikely to be effective. Unless a pet parent is teaching this at home, save your fingers by either flat-palming the treats or tossing them on the ground. These techniques won’t teach your dog or their dog park friends to take the treats politely, but they do keep your fingers safe!",

    "page_content": "Your dog is not mysterious about how they feel. When you get home, they greet you at the door with kisses. When you lace up your shoes, they try to lure you back with a request for belly rubs because they’re sad you’re leaving. But here’s one thing you can’t so easily tell from your dog: how they’ll behave based on their breed.\nPeopleoften cite breedwhen trying to account for the ways dogs behave. But according to Christine Hibbard, owner ofCompanion Animal Solutionsin Seattle, when associating a dog with the “look” or “behavior” of a particular breed, it’s important to remember that “the way dogs look and their actual genetics can be very different.” That, at least, is what studies are showing. As Dr. Victoria Voith, a veterinary behaviorist at Western University of Health Sciences explains, “Mixed breed dogs are a collage of features of their ancestors. So much so that they often don’t look like any of their immediate parents or grandparents. In fact, they may look more like other breeds.”\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nNo Two Dogs Alike\nDNA tests often reveal that dogs are not simply a cross between two purebred parents. Instead, tests often come back with percentages of varying breeds — many of which you could have never guessed by appearance. Since a dog’s looks and their genetic code can be on very different pages — sometimes in different books altogether — attributing a dog’s behavior to their “look” can sometimes be a faulty assumption.\nThis even applies to purebred dogs to a degree despite their concentrated breeding pools.  The AKC and other breed-certifying organizations certainly ascribe global attributes to breeds, but they are simply guidelines. As Denise Herman, lead trainer and founder of Empire of the Dog in NYC, says, “When you get a puppy of a particular breed, people think it’s a blank slate, but it’s really an unknown slate. Breed gives an indication of where that unknown slate may go, but not all Border Collies herd, not all Huskies pull sleds and some Chows like everyone equally. A puppy of a particular breed is an unknown slate with the possibility of those characteristics.”\nWhile genetics get a dog started, developmental factors such as environment, learning and individual life experiences make each dog who they are. No two dogs on the planet will have the exact same life experiences, which means no two dogs, even of the same breed, will have the exact same personality or responses to similar situations. However, the means of expressing those reactions can very much be related to physical attributes.\nMixed Signals\nAccording to Dr. Stephen Zawistowski, science advisor to the ASPCA, “There are some things that are anatomically not possible for a dog to do. How can you tell if a Basset Hound has their ears up and forward? A Rottweiler can make a great lip pucker, but how on earth can a Bulldog pucker?” To be sure, the lack of overt behavioral signals does not suggest a dog is not feeling a particular emotion, or even that they might not adopt different strategies to convey them. But the implication is clear: The perception that Rottweilers are aggressive and Basset Hounds are laid-back could be a function of their physical features — and thus, the behaviors they can perform — rather than their mental processes.\nWith this in mind, could a dog’s physical appearance affect how they communicate? Or even, for that matter, how they’re treated by other members of their species? Dr. Jim Ha, research associate professor and staff member of Companion Animal Solutions in Seattle breaks it down. “The way dogs look — their morphology — can definitely change the quality of their visual signal,” he explains. “Dogs who are more infantile in appearance — paedomorphic dogs like French Bulldogs, Pugs and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels — are nice examples of how we are handicapping the dog’s ability to signal properly. But we also find that dogs who are not paedomorphic in appearance can have trouble signaling and communicating with one another as well. Signaling difficulty is not only associated with paedomorphic dogs.”\nImpact of Docked Tails\nHa suggests that many aggression issues stem from the misuse of signals and miscommunication between dogs. A prime example is dog tails come in a spectrum of shapes and sizes. When asked to assess dog behavior, humans tend to pay an inordinate amount ofattention to the tail. But is the same true for dog-to-dog communication?\nWhen researchers with the journalBehavioral and Brain Functionsexplored how dogs respond to other dogs’ tails, they pulled out the big guns: a model robot resembling a Labrador Retriever. Apart from its tail, the “dog” was motionless. The researchers found that when the bot had a long wagging tail, it was approached more than when it had a long still tail — which as you probably assumed, suggests that the tail conveys emotional state, and that wagging is more inviting than not wagging.\nWhen it came to short tails, the story changed. There was no difference between how the robot dog with a short/still and a short/wagging tail was approached. It appears that the longer tails were most effective at conveying emotional information, and since short tails are hard to read, they might not be read at all.\nFor Herman, the implications are obvious. “When you dock tails, it takes away part of their communication signal — essentially the dog version of botox. Ear cropping falls in the same category. Dobermans with cropped ears ostensibly look alert to other dogs. They can’t be read [accurately] because they can’t change.” It’s difficult to derive cues and information from cropped ears. If anything, their constantly alert position could mislead other dogs.\nE’Lise Christensen, a board-certified veterinary behaviorist in New York City, agrees, “I think cosmetic alteration could affect communication with other dogs. It certainly [has an impact on] assessments by owners, because they forget to look at the stump of the tail for movement and tension. Ears that are too cropped mean owners have to look for muscular movement at the skull level rather than the pinna, the outer part of the ear, where we customarily look. Flat faces make it more difficult to read small muscular movements.”\nHerman suggests that taking note of a dog’s morphology can give pet parents a better appreciation for their dog. “It’s hard for other dogs to see that a Chow is really stiff, simply because they are [engulfed] in a ball of hair. It can be helpful for dog parents to recognize that what dogs have or do not have at their disposal could add confusion to dog-dog communication. This appreciation could help people empathize with their dog, instead of blaming their dog or feeling angry for the dog’s behavior.”\nHibbard reminds us that the issue at hand can be twofold, “If you can’t see the ears, that’s one problem. But if you can see the ears but the dog uses them wrong, that’s another problem.”\nIt’s All About Us\nNo dog story is complete without the human element. Many pet professionals believe there should be guidelines or legislation set for these cosmetic alterations. TheAmerican Veterinary Medical Associationand theAmerican Animal Hospital Associationoppose ear cropping and tail-docking for cosmetic purposes. Each states that the procedure causes dogs pain and distress and runs risks of complications, hemorrhage and infection. Across the pond, manyEuropean nations banned these practices in 1987. In the UK, tail docking is considered to be mutilation where it was banned in 2007 with an exemption for some working dogs.\nWhile there are many who oppose cropping and docking, others downplay the concern. Members of the American Kennel Club and breeders line up to defend docking, which they call an acceptable practice “integral to defining and preserving breed character, enhancing good health, and preventing injuries.” While opposing a New York State bill banning tail docking, the AKC claimed, “an intact tail at full-length would result in injured and bloodied tails when the dogs perform the functions for which they were bred.”\nCurrently, Maryland and Pennsylvania are the only states in the U.S. that have somerestrictions on the tail docking of dogs. But these laws are more about basic humane practices than anything else. Maryland’s law stipulates that the procedure must be performed by a licensed veterinarian with anesthesia. On the other hand, Pennsylvania law prohibits the average person from docking their dog’s tail after five days of age. Veterinarians are required to wait until 12-weeks and use anesthesia — unless it is “medically necessary” to do so earlier.\nAside from the health consequences, what do we do to a dog’s ability to speak to us when we cut off this important communication tool? Could morphology play a role in the way dogs and humans interact? Dogs excel at being in sync with us, whether on the agility course or when they’re trying to figure out if we’re going into the bathroom versus the far more enticing kitchen. But not unlike the chemistry in a long-term relationship, sometimes dogs are out of sync.\nTraining, life experience, genetics and psychological disorders are the common suspects for “out-of-sync” behavior, but how a dog looks — or rather, sees — is often overlooked. In 2003, professor Paul McGreevy, a researcher at the University of Sydney, and his colleagues discovered that, contrary to popular belief,all canine eyes are not the same. Short-nosed dogs have what is called an area centralis, which allows them to focus more clearly on the world in front of them, like humans, while long-nosed dogs have a visual streak, which enables better peripheral vision. There’s a physiological reason why a long-nosed dog would take off after something way in the periphery while you and a short-nosed dog continue to sit on a park bench wondering what the long-nosed dog saw.\nIt stands to reason that these differences would not only affect how dogs see the world around them, but also how they attend to us humans, and that’s exactly what we find. Dogs are quite adept at following our pointing gestures, but brachycephalic (flat-faced) breeds, with their more forward-facing eyes, follow these gestures better than dolichocephalic (long-nosed) breeds. In turn, this sense of being seen and responded to accordingly (or not) may affect how we perceive and relate to dogs.\nUndoubtedly, dogs are a composite of their genes and individual life experiences. But the physical features that they come with, or that we give them via docking and breeding, can contribute to how they interact with others and are perceived by dogs and humans alike. When thinking about why your dog behaves the way they do, it’s one of the few instances that where it can be helpful to be superficial and look at what’s right in front of you.",

    "page_content": "In my house live two very different dogs. The first is Moose, a toothless Dachshund with the heart of an angel…and the intellect of a toenail. The second is Harper, a Lab-Pittie mix who also has a heart of an angel but with a brain capacityslightlyhigher than her brother’s.\nBecause Harper requires more stimulation than her keratin-brained counterpart, it can be hard to find a toy that keeps her busy on her own. Her mom, Holly, and I both work from home and spend most of our days tragically turning Harper away as she begs us to play with her. Even worse, she will then turn to Moose for a game of tug of war — only to realize, for the 100th time that day, that Moose’s gummy grip is hardly a worthy challenge.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nTo avoid reliving this melodrama every day of our young lives, Holly and I began investing in every kind ofdog puzzle toywe could find. However, we soon found ourselves with a twofold problem. The soft toys, often marketed as indestructible, were quickly, albeit quietly, torn to shreds — never lasting more than a Zoom call. While the harder plastic toys fared better against Harper, they didn’t exactly go easy on our hardwood floors — not to mention our ears. We were all getting frustrated (well, not Harper so much as she kept getting new toys) until we found Wild One’s Tennis Tumble.\nAvailable in several dreamy colors, the Tennis Tumble is Wild One’s first-ever enrichment toy and an absolute lifesaver for remote working pup parents. The toy consists of two surprisingly simple parts: a rubber barrel and a tennis ball. Your dog’s job is equally simple, but one they will not take lightly: to get the ball out of the barrel.\nIt’s a task easier said than done, and it keeps Harper occupied for over an hour — which is usually followed by a well-deserved seven-hour nap. Even better, the Tennis Tumble can withstand Harper’s powerful play (read: it has yet to disintegrate before my very eyes). And, since the toy is made out of soft, food-grade plastic, it doesn’t clang against my floors all day long — it’s more like a rubbery thud but I’ll take it. As previously touched upon, it comes in several of Wild One’s signature tones and can be paired with one of their balls or any standard-sized tennis ball.\nI truly only have good things to say about this toy, but if I were to point to a watch-out, it would be that the Tennis Tumble is only intended for medium to large-sized dogs. By Wild One’s standard that means the toy should only be used by dogs over 20 pounds. That’s kind of a bummer for pup parents of smaller dogs, many of whom (who aren’t Moose) require mental stimulation just as much as their larger buddies. Here’s hoping Wild One introduces a smaller size for more petite pups, as they do with most of their other offerings.\nStill, if you have a medium or large-sized dog (with a medium or large-sized brain) then the Tennis Tumble might be the ticket to a productive work day — for pups and parents alike.",

    "page_content": "When my husband and I decided we were going to start a family, Chi Chi — our English Bulldog — was our main concern. We had two dogs at the time. Our first, Nina, is a rescue Pit Bull who I’ve had for seven or eight years. She loves affection but she lives in her own world, so I’ve never really worried about her. Our second, Chi Chi, is intenselyour child. My husband and I were in a long-distance relationship in the beginning, so Chi Chi would fly back and forth on planes with us everywhere — wherever we went, we knew Chi Chi was coming. We figured that if we got a third dog, that would ease Chi Chi into accepting a new family member, our rationale being that he would get a taste of notallthe attention being on him, realize he was still loved, and then not resent the baby when she arrived.\nNina is deaf and Chi Chi is far from being a guard dog, so we were looking for a dog who would be as family-oriented as they were protective of property. We were also looking for a “nanny dog” who’d influence Chi Chi’s relationship with the baby. Everywhere I looked, people recommended Mastiffs. We ended up manifesting the perfect puppy who needed a home, Nutella.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nAs soon as I became pregnant, we started bringing up “the baby” to the dogs. I’d point to my stomach and ask where “the baby” was, and when they came near I’d remind them to be “gentle with the baby,” so by the time Carmela came they knew “gentle with the baby” as a command. We also made sure the dogs spent a lot of time around kids before Carmela was born. Nutella is 100 pounds and Chi Chi is obsessed with balls, so my friend would bring her seven-month-old son over and we’d make it clear that the dogs could not touch his ball. For the little boy, that meant telling him not to throw the ball in the dog’s face because that’s mean — it’s teasing the dog. And for the dogs, that meant letting them play but correcting their behavior any time they’d put their mouths on the ball. We didn’t lock the dogs up or use fear-based training methods — we taught them that they had to figure out how to coexist.\nI knew we’d need a routine for all of the dogs when the baby arrived. Going on walks with them is impossible because they’d need to be walked for 10 hours just to get their zoomies out! But we found a group of dog people in the neighborhood who meet up at a huge park and let their dogs all play together, so we take Chi Chi and Nutella there every morning. We started this routine halfway through my pregnancy, so by the time Carmela came, they knew that we still start the day with something that’s just for them, and they can get all their energy out.\nWhen Carmela was born, we wanted things to be business as usual. When we’d post photos of the dogs with us in bed, people would joke, “It won’t be like that when the baby gets here!” I was like,why would the dogs not be in our bed?Our whole life doesn’t have to change with the baby. When you’re pregnant, your body’s already changing and you’re adjusting to so much — but having the world turn upside down felt, to me, unnecessary.\nOne of the first things we did was let the dogs into Carmela’s room. I’ve seen a trainer recommend keeping the dogs away from the baby’s room, but allowing them to relax in there is what worked for us. There’s a daybed in her room, and I got a trundle bed that the dogs can lounge on. I didn’t want to keep the dogs away — I worried they might get too curious or start resenting her. So, they can be in her room with boundaries: they can’t jump on her chair, they can’t jump in her crib, and they can’t touch her toys. And they love it. Every time we change her diaper, the dogs are there. Sometimes I’ll go into Carmela’s room and Nutella’s just lying in there by herself.\nWe give Chi Chi a lot of special time just for himself. He’s the only one who gets to go to work with his daddy at Ghiaia Cashmere in Pasadena. We give him lots of special attention so he knows the baby isn’t enemy number one. I also make sure that when the dogs are close to the baby, I don’t get mad at them. I don’t yell at them or tell them to go away. Instead, I make sure that being around her doesn’t become a negative thing — I’ll pet them and ask, “Are you gentle with the baby?” Last night when I was breast-feeding, Nutella put her head on the breast-feeding pillow at my waist. I could have pushed her off, but that would have created a negative interaction between the two of them. So now I make sure that when I’m breastfeeding, I lean over and kiss Nutella, and I ask her, “Do you love the baby?”\nAnd it goes both ways; every animal and child in this house needs to know that they’re not top dog. Carmela’s going to have to learn to love the animals and accept their boundaries, too. I was bitten by a dog when I was little — I got too close to his face when he was eating and he snapped at me — but I didn’t let that stop me from loving dogs. We trained Nutella to let us take her toys away from her when she’s chewing: we’d give her a bone, and as soon as she’d get really into the bone we’d take it away, then we’d kiss her face and give the bone back. And, of course, we’ll teach Carmela not to go near a dog’s face when they’re eating! We can’t keep her away from the dogs at all timesjust in casesomething happens — life isn’t like that.\nEspecially for me, as it happens. Every time someone in the neighborhood finds a dog, I rescue them and try to get them adopted. When I was nine months pregnant, I brought a Pit Bull home who I’d found on the street in Silver Lake. My husband will say, “You can’t keep bringing dogs home!” But I can’t go around saying I love animals and then not open my home to a stray dog — it’s hypocritical. We’re always willing to make space for more humansandmore animals. That’s just how our home is.\nDisclaimer: This is my personal story.

While it's true that adopting a puppy can bring a much-needed source of joy and unconditional love into your life, it can also bring stress, anxiety, exhaustion, and frustration (often called the “puppy blues”). The cycle of cleaning up messes and constantly removing household objects from those tiny teeth can become overwhelming, particularly if you’re also working from home during this time.\nIt’s normal for the entire process to make you feel drained (especially when you’re running on little sleep!). Fortunately, there are ways to make it easier on both of you. Here are six super helpful strategies for coping with the stress of new pup parenthood.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\n1. Create an Exercise Routine\nAlthough the ball of fur zooming around your living room each morning mayseemlike the Energizer Bunny, that puppy energy actually comes in short (yet invigorating) bursts. If you can give them a way to release that, they’ll likely be ready to rest afterward.\nIf going for a walk doesn’t fit into your day, there are plenty ofother ways to exercise your puppy. Play a few rounds of fetch or engage them in chasing a toy around the living room. You can even set up a treasure hunt by hiding smalltreatsand tossing a few across the floor to get their attention.\nDogs thrive in routine, so try to exercise your pup at the same times each day — even better, schedule playtime for the hours when they naturally get thezoomies.\n2. Enforce Nap Time\nThey say dogs are our best friends, but naps may be a close second — especially when it comes to puppy parenting. Instead of waiting for your pup to seem sleepy, you can (and should!) put them down for a nap, just as you would a human child. That way, you won’t have to feel like your day is tossed around at the whims of your dog’s mood.\nJust like toddlers become cranky when they’re low on sleep, puppies may act up when they’re overtired in the form of biting, chewing, barking, or whining. Despite their daily bursts of energy, they actually need a lot of downtime; it’s healthy for them to sleepmore than 17 hoursa day.\nDog trainer Sarah Hodgsonrecommends that puppies younger than 18 weeks old take a two- to three-hour nap twice a day. After morning playtime and again after lunch, try putting your pup in their crate with a toy for some downtime. They may be restless at first, but if you’re consistent, they’ll settle into the routine and learn to self-soothe.\n3. Provide Toys for Mental Stimulation\nAny time you put your pup down for a nap, or when they’re simply hanging out with you in the house, make sure they have access to toys that provide mental stimulation — because mental exercise is just as important as physical. Toys also keep pups entertained, which means they won’t occupy themselves by nipping, digging, or barking for attention from their favorite person (yep, that’s you).\nEven if your dog is injured and can't exercise, you can still keep them entertained. Here's how.\nInteractive gamesare also an excellent way to give your pup’s brain a workout by having them solve puzzles in order to access a treat or prize. Chew toys are another good option because they’re not only mentally stimulating, but can also reduce stress and anxiety. Not to mention, when your pup is occupied with a great chew toy, it ensures they’re not mauling your favorite book or the leg of your coffee table.\n4. Ask a Friend to Puppysit\nThere’s nothing wrong with taking a short break from your pup to refill your own cup. The great thing about puppies is that they’re a lot of fun to be around, especially for those who haven’t spent the morning scrubbing a pee stain out of a favorite rug. Many people will jump at the chance to spend quality time with an adorable puppy.\nAsk a trusted friend or relative to watch your puppy for an afternoon, or even a full day. This will not only allow you to be “off the clock” from puppy duty, but can also contribute to your dog’s socialization by helping them learn to be comfortable with different people. Take some time to refresh so you can bring your best self to your puppy when they return from their play date.\n5. Reward Calmness\nWhen you catch your puppy being calm, reward them with food. Reinforcing calm behavior is a great training technique for raising a well-mannered dog.\nA popular method for this is calledcapturing calmness: Keep some training treats nearby during the day, and whenever you notice your puppy lying down calmly — quietly chewing a toy or simply relaxing — silently walk over to them and place a treat at their feet.\nThe first few times you provide a treat, they may get up and act excited. That’s okay, because you’ve successfully rewarded calm behavior. Simply walk away without reacting. By repeating this technique over time, you can help your pup build a positive emotional association with relaxation.\nWhen youcreate a calm environmentby giving your dog a routine they can count on, toys for mental stimulation, and removing stressful triggers, they’ll find it easier to relax.\nIf your dog loses their sh*t over anything—from a squirrel to a guest. Here are some tips to curtail that.\n6. Give Yourself a Mantra\nFollowing training advice and sticking to a routine for exercise and downtime can make puppyhood smoother, but you’ll still have moments when you’re just plain tired of cleaning up random puddles and fending off sharp teeth.\nFor those times, come up with a mantra that you can repeat to yourself as a way of calming your emotions and reminding your brain that this is a temporary phase. Perhaps a phrase like, “I can do this,” or “The puppy phase shall pass,” or “This is just one moment.” The next time you’re ready to bury your face in your pillow, take a deep breath, crate your puppy for five minutes while you compose yourself, and repeat your mantra.\nAs you and your puppy build a bond, you’ll settle into your own shared routine and life together will get a lot easier. Soon enough, you won’t be able to imagine life without them.",

    "page_content": "On the heels ofThe Great Resignationis Great Return-to-Work. Unless you canbring your dog to workwith you, have atrusted doggie daycare, or chose to switch jobs / reduce hours (asNewsweekreported more than half of millennials have), you may befeeling pretty guilty about leaving your petat home when you inevitably return to work. You’re not alone.\nTruth be told, many dogs do just fine, and simply relax andsleep for a good part of the daywhile we stress out at work. I say “many” because I’mnotincluding dogs who are too young to handle a lot of time alone, or those who are struggling withseparation anxietyor some other condition that makes being at home without you truly traumatic or even just unpleasant. I’m talking about behaviorally healthy dogs who really don’t mind the daily rhythm that includes your regular workday absence (though obviously, they wouldratheryou stayed home).\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nAlong with making sure that their basic needs are met, what else should you provide your dog while you’re gone? Some dogs are fine witha cozy place to snooze, and some may be satisfied with a compatible dog buddy or some toys. Others need a little help in finding interesting ways to stay occupied. That’s where activity stations come in. Activity stations are just what they sound like: places for dogs to engage in activities that can be done alone. Setting up different activity stations in distinct areas of your house allows dogs to make good choices and have fun even when they’re on their own.\nActivity Station Ideas\nThis kind of enrichment won’t cure separation anxiety or help a dog overcome a fear of traffic, airplanes, passersby or the sound of sirens, and it’s not a cure forexcessive barkingor destructive chewing. What it can do, however, is make being alone more fun. Here’s how. Deciding what sorts of activity stations will work best for your dog requires you to give some thought to your home’s layout and your dog’s interests and abilities. But basically, they are really only limited by safety concerns and your creativity. Here are some fun ideas:\nSome stations are extremely simple, involving nothing more than atug toyattached to the wall with a carabiner and a sturdy hook. Dogs who love to tug often do best if the toy is a little stretchy to compensate for the fact that nobody is on the other end giving it life and motion. The toy must be safe — there should be no chance of the dog choking on it, becoming entangled in it, or shredding it. A tug station is not suitable for dogs who would either become obsessive about it or frustrated by it. To interest your dog in a tug toy station, shake the toy a little to make it move before you go to work; once your dog a hold of it, let them tug on their own. Putting peanut butter on the toy makes it more enticing and helps many dogs engage with it more.\nA related activity station is for dogs who like to bat at toys rather than tug them. As long as the dog won’t become entangled in the toy or attempt to ingest it, this sort of station can occupy dogs who love to use their paws in play. Toys with multiple hanging parts often appeal to dogs who like to play this way.\nAnother simple activity station consists of providing your dog with something safe to chew or eat. This doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to buy hundreds of new items. Rotating your dog’s durable favorites, supplemented by an occasional new treat, keeps this activity station from costing a fortune. You can also use stuffable toys, such asKongs, or toys that your dog has to chase around or otherwise manipulate for the food to be dispensed — for example, the Wobbling Treatball, Kong Wobbler, West Paw Design's Toppl or Buster Cube.\nMake sure you are not giving your dog anything that poses a choking hazard or other dangers. Avoid rawhides and rope toys, and check with your vet about what else may be dangerous for an unsupervised dog. For safety and convenience, create the station away from areas that are off limits to your dog (such as the counter or where your kids store their toys).\nGet your fix of Kinship\nWe promise not to send you garbage that turns your inbox into a litter box.

Hide treats while your dog is in another room, say “Find your treats,” and then head out for the day. (If your dog is sure to follow you, tell them to “stay,” or close a gate or door while you hide the treats.)\nTeaching your dog to search for food in response to the cue “Find your treats” is not hard, but it’s critical to start by making it easy and gradually working up to greater challenges. Start with the food in full view and point to it or tap your toe by each treat until your dog gets the hang of it. You can also hide treats in dogpuzzle toysthat are specifically designed for this purpose.\nThis is a great activity station, but for most dogs, it’s only appealing if the contents change frequently. To maintain your dog’s interest, rotate toys in and out and add new ones regularly. That way, your dog will never know which toys will be available on a given day. If your dog has a couple of favorites, make sure they’re always on-hand.\nFor dogs who like to fetch, independent play may seem harder to provide. However, some dogs can be taught to fetch on their own using a ball and a ramp or an iFetch. There needs to be enough space for them to chase after the ball without injuring themselves (or your furniture). It takes practice and patience, but once dogs get it, they are able to play on their own.\nTo teach dogs to use a ramp as a fetching station, start by placing the ball on the ramp and letting it roll away. This accustoms dogs to fetching a ball that has been “thrown” by the ramp. Then, teach them to drop the ball at the top of the ramp themselves. Once dogs realize that they can make the ramp work for them, many really enjoy the activity, though I’ve yet to meet a dog who didn’t prefer fetch played as a social game outdoors. (Caution: this activity station is not suitable for dogs who are so obsessive about fetch that they would play all day and drive themselves mad.)\nAgain, the safety of the stations and their elements is critical. Don’t use anything that could in any way strangle or trap a dog. Only use toys that can handle serious chewing, the level of which varies from dog to dog. Avoid rawhide or rope toys that a dog can choke on. If in doubt, put the toy away before you leave.\nHow to Teach Your Dog to Engage With An Activity Station\nDon’t expect dogs to automatically be interested in activity stations just because you’ve set them up, however lovingly. The statement “If you build it, they will come” rarely applies. Dogs have to be taught what to do and to understand that the stations have entertainment value before they will engage on their own.\nDogs need specific training for each type of activity station, but some general guidelines apply to all:\nIntroduce your dog to one new station at a time.\nIntroduce your dog to one new station at a time.\nWork step-by-step. Don’t expect your dog to go immediately from expressing some interest to full engagement.\nWork step-by-step.

Providing them with something constructive to do can improve their quality of life. The stations can also help you fulfill your responsibility to make sure your dog is happy, stimulated and entertained (not to mention, relieve your guilt) when you leave the house. Above all, they’re a wonderful way to change your dogs’ daily alone time from “fine” to “fun.”",

      "title": "My Dog Is Misbehaving. What Should I Do?",
      "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/misbehaving-dog"
    },
    "page_content": "When living or working with a dog who’s not doing what you want them to do, it’s natural to feel as though they’re intentionally misbehaving or causing trouble. You might even assume that the fault lies with the dog. But when you blame the dog, it will ultimately just impede progress towards your training goals. So, what should you do when a dog misbehaves?\nConsider why your dog is misbehaving.\nIn my experience, dogs who aren’t doing what you ask need help (practice, information, or compassion), notcorrection(anger, disgust, or disappointment). The dog may not understand the cue given; they may not have had enough practice to do it reliably; they may be too distracted, stressed, or afraid.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nTo figure out what the issue is, consider this: The dog is notgivingyou a hard time, but rather, they’rehavinga hard time. For whatever reason, they’re not doing as we ask because they can’t. Something is getting in their way, whether it’s their emotional state, their context, or because they haven’t had enough training to succeed. With that in mind, you need to ask yourself how you can help them accomplish the task at hand.\nOne of the first steps — and I don’t say this in an accusatory way — is to stop putting all the blame on the dog. Training a dog is a cooperative enterprise; we teach dogs how to behave, and they learn what to do when we make specific requests of them. By taking responsibility, you switch from the idea that your dog is “misbehaving” to the realization that you need to make it easier for your dog when they’re not succeeding.\nWhat to do when your dog misbehaves.\nWith that in mind, here are the most common strategies professional dog trainers use to “fix” the problem of a dog who is not responding to commands. Each method requires accepting that it is the pet parent’s responsibility to help their dog so they can learn to do what is asked of them.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s pro tips for walking a pup that wantsto chase everything that moves.\nStart with the basics: do more training and usepositive reinforcementfor all your training. If your dog resists going into a down, start making “down” their ticket to the good things in life. Ask them to lie down before you go for a walk, before you let them out, before you feed them, before you give them a new toy or a treat — you get the idea. Once they learn to associate lying down with whatever makes them happy, they will be more likely to lie down in new and different contexts.\nEach time you reward a dog after performing the desired action, they’re more likely to do that same action again in the future because of positive reinforcement. By helping your dog make this connection a lot of times, you build a strong reinforcement history with a behavior, making it more likely that your dog will perform it.\nDogs, contrary to old-school ideas, don’t want to please us. They want to do what is pleasing to them. For that matter, individuals of every species, including our own, act in ways that cause good things to happen for them. Using positive reinforcement (and lots of it!) is the way to align what your dog wants to do with what you want them to do.\nA fundamental principle of dog training is to repeatedly set your dog up for success. We can only reinforce the behavior we want if that behavior occurs, so we must increase the odds of the behavior happening. Creating situations in which the behavior is highly likely to occur and then reinforcing it makes it more likely to occur in the future. With lots of repetition in increasingly challenging situations, the dog will be able to perform the desired behavior in a broader range of contexts.\nFor example, suppose your dogbarks and lunges whenever they see another dogwhile out on a walk. How can you get them to act appropriately inthissituation? The answer is to set them up for success by not putting them in situations they are guaranteed to fail. Instead, introduce them to situations where they’ll have a positive outcome and gradually increase the level of difficulty as they get better at dealing with it. What they can handle is a moving target, but it must be moved gradually.\nHere’s one scenario: Enlist a friend with a calm dog (or even a stuffed dog if a real dog is too much of a challenge) to stand roughly a block away. After walking with your dog a few feet in their direction, ask them to turn and walk in another direction or to look at you. Then, break out the treats, praise, toys, or other reinforcement to reward them for doing what you ask. That’s a success, and you set them up for that success by staying at a distance from a stationary dog who would normally trigger their aggression if moving nearby. As they get better at this, make the situation slightly more challenging, perhaps by walking a little closer to the target dog or seeing a dog in the distance moving rather than standing still. Gradually increasing the difficulty and helping your dog to have multiple successes at each level is the best way to help your dog improve.\nDog trainer Pat Miller’s pro tips for preventing your pup from darting out the door.\nWhen we manage a situation to prevent trouble, we are doing our dogs a big favor. Do you have a dog who doesn’t reliably come when called? Don’t let them off-leash in an area that is not fenced. They can’t handle that amount of freedom which will only lead to negative consequences:\nThey will ignore you when you call them to come.\nThey will ignore you when you call them to come.\nThey will learn that you can’t make them come or catch them.\nThey will learn that you can’t make them come or catch them.\nThey may put themselves in danger.\nThey may put themselves in danger.\nLong leashes and fences keep them from getting themself into trouble while they’re learninga solid recall. Similarly, if they act in an out-of-control way when people come to the door, you can prevent that chaos by giving them a stuffed Kong or a chew toy to keep them occupied before visitors arrive, or have them on the other side of a gate to keep them from leaping on your guests. That’smanaging the situationto make it easier for them to do the right thing. The same goes for door darting dogs — it is your job to prevent your dog from escaping by using gates, leashes, or keeping the door closed. Prevent undesired behavior while you work on training your dog to have a better recall.\nThere may be many reasons your dog isn’t doing what you want: the presence of distractions; a new context; a less-than-calm emotional state —scared, stressed, anxious, nervous, excited, agitated, or upset in some other way; an unclear cue; even discomfort or pain.\nOne secret of dog training is that teaching a dog to perform a behavior on cue is only the first step in truly training that dog. A large part of our efforts must go toward teaching the dog to do a cued behavior in a variety of situations and contexts. There’s a big difference between asking your dog to come when they’re in the backyard and to come when they’re running free through the neighborhood, or to roll over in the family room when nothing’s going on and to roll over immediately after entering the dog park when a dozen dogs have just swarmed them.\nWhile this makes sense, it may be difficult to recognize more subtle challenges to a dog’s ability to respond as you wish, such as the scent of steaks on the neighbor’s grill, a storm in the distance, or a visitor watching as we try to show off our dog’s new trick. Other things like giving hand signals while wearing gloves or a thick winter coat may change the movements or cause anxiety making the dog incapable of concentrating on even simple tasks, such as sitting on request.\nOnce you recognize the possible reasons your dog is not doing what you want, you are far more likely to be able to solve the problem. If your dog is scared, you can help them overcome their fears, remove them from the situation that’s scaring them, or lower your expectations while they’re in that scary situation. You can help them move away from distractions or ask them to do something easier until youregain their full attention.\nSay What? A look at the types of words that dogs understand.\nWhen you empathize with how hard it can be for your dog to learn all the skills you want them to have and to respond to your cues no matter what’s going on around them, or going on internally, you can more easily train them.\nTry not to think of your dog as being stubborn or misbehaving — don’t complain that your dog has a mind of their own. Of course, they do. Dogs are independent beings. There’s no reason to expect that they’ll do what we want unless we give them a reason. We make that happen with prevention and management, by setting them up for success and using a lot of positive reinforcement, and looking for reasons they aren’t responding as we want them to.\nRather than describing a dog using the words “stubborn,” “rebellious,” “disobedient,” “ignoring,” “refusing,” or “misbehaving,” look for ways to turn things around. To achieve the goal of a better-trained dog, the shift must start in your mind, with a change in perspective.\nTraining will be more successful, and your dog’s behavior will improve when you recognize your role in the process. By correcting your own mistakes, you can have a dog who does as you ask. That makes your relationship better, your interactions more fun, and allows your dog to have more freedom.",

    "page_content": "Most dog owners would love to have their pets on a more expansivetraining regimen. They want all the best for their pups, but daily teaching exercises take time that not everyone has the luxury to spare. Just as the microwave freed us from hours in the kitchen,Companiondeveloped a device that’ll cover the time and energy needed to give your dog all the proper training it deserves.\n“We basically want to give you superpowers with all of the behaviors that make living with your loved one as safe, convenient, and fun as possible,” says Companion founder and CEO John Honchariw. The company has created an AI device that automatically trains and engages with your dog whether you’re home or not. It analyzes behavior in real-time and adapts to each animal’s specific needs. “We call it training, but what we’re really focused on is improving the consistency and responsiveness of all of the commands and communications that make up what people generally refer to as the human-animal bond, or at least a subset of it.”\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nWhile this may seem like something you’d see on aStar Trekepisode, the inspiration behind Companion is simply wholesome curiosity. It grew out of a childhood fascination with better understanding our favorite four-legged animals. Honchariw says he started the company with a “personal passion for understanding animals, deep empathy for animals, and love for automation” — a passion that soon turned to profits. Companion recently enjoyed a total of eight million dollars in investments from industry leaders including Mars, Central Garden, and Pet and Michelson Found Animals — demonstrating the intrigue and confidence many in pet care have for the concept of an artificial dog trainer.\nFor those fearful of a Skynet-esque robot revolution, be at ease — the tech is only a portion of the device. In fact, Companion has a roster of professional trainers on hand that they’ll connect you with via its accompanying app. Led by a team of advisors including Dr. Marty Becker, DVM, Founder ofFear Free; Erica Feuerbacher, Assistant Professor of Companion Animal Behavior and Welfare at Virginia Tech; and Ken Ramirez, Executive Vice President and Chief Training Officer ofKaren Pryor Clicker Training— the company aims to provide the most up-to-date and innovative expertise and research. Beginning with a personalized guided onboarding, your coach will be available to you along the way to ensure your dog has all the learning tools they need. The app also tracks their development, allowing you to see progress in real-time.\n“The unfair advantage that devices generally have is that they are perfectly consistent and they’re infinitely patient. So they think nothing of helping you with 10,000 practices of ‘sit’ over the first six to nine months to really get that behavior going,” Honchariw explains. “And the coach is really there to help you generalize that behavior, to help transfer the behavior from the machine to you and give you fun exercises to really build up that muscle.”\nCrucially, Companion emphasizes all training is done only throughpositive reinforcement. The device will provide a treat for your pup when they execute a desired action and withhold them while they learn. According to Honchariw, it’s all about what’s best for the animal. “We are squarely in the camp of positive reinforcement only because we do think consistency is kindness.”\nWhile the official release date has not yet been announced, Honchariw believes that training is only the beginning of the Companion technology’s usage. “Over the next five, 10, 20 years, I would love for this new class of device to help us far more deeply understand all the animals around us,” he says. “But also use that same technology to help us better understand the natural world.” In the meantime, you can sign up forCompanion’s newsletterfor early enrollment of your pet, exclusive content from expert coaches, and first dibs on the device as soon as it becomes available.",

    "page_content": "You do a lot for your dog: youwalk them,feed them,groom them, take them tothe vet, spoil them with squeaky toys, buy them adorable sweaters (okay, that last one’s all you)... In other words, you’re probably ticking all the dog-duty boxes, and that’s great. But here’s the thing: Meeting your dog’s basic needs isn’t the only way to keep them happy and healthy. There are a lot of little things you can do that (thankfully) don’t require a ton of extra work. Try these tips to boost your dog’s joy — and your own in the process.\n1. Make Life An Adventure\nMany dogs sniffing out new places, so instead of taking the same walk every day,explore new territory: A swimming hole, ahiking trail, or even just walking in a new neighborhood can add fun and interest to your dog’s life. Any unfamiliar place will be full of new smells, and that’s a pleasure for many dogs. (You get bonus points if your dog lovescar ridessince new adventures often involve taking a drive.)\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\n2. Let Your Dog Make Choices\nMost dogs love the freedom to make their own decisions. If there are places your dog can safely be off-leash, take advantage of them. Allow your dog to choose where to run and how fast, whether to roll or frolic, and what to smell and for how long.\nWhen that’s not possible, give your dog choices on some of your walks. Let them choose the route, the pace andwhat is worthy of extensive sniffing. Just like us, dogs like the chance to do whattheywant to do — to explore and to roam — and facilitating that is a great kindness.\n3. Play, Play and Play Some More\nI cannot emphasize enough how much play can add to a dog’s happiness. If dogs could talk, many of them would probably say that play time is the best part of the day. When dogs play, they are having fun, which is often the most direct route to happiness. In addition to the obvious fun, play also provides mental and physical exercise and socializing opportunities, and leads to feelings of success as well as enhanced cooperation. Plus, it’s a great boredom-buster.\nIf your dog loves to play in certain ways, indulge them in that kind of fun; if your dog doesn't have specific interests, explore things that may intrigue them. Many dogs learn to love play if you teach them to be interested in toys. Of course, not all dogs take to toys, but many will learn to love them with a little help. If you think your dog has no interest in play, I urge you to explore chase games before you close the book on the subject. Many people find that if they teach their dogs how to play and entice them with just the right kind of games, dogs who seemed uninterested turn out to be playful after all.\nGet your fix of Kinship\nWe promise not to send you garbage that turns your inbox into a litter box.

Make Toys and Chews a Priority\nEnriching objects and activities prevent dog boredom while providing mental exercise. Chewing is a very natural activity for dogs. I know from my own household accounting just how expensive it can be to supply new chewables, but still, I encourage you to budget for them. Remember that dogs areusingthose toys, notruiningthem. If your dog tends to pull the stuffing out of fleece toys, consider buying them toys without stuffing.\nSince chew items are meant to be used up, it’s worth paying attention to how much bang for your buck you get with the various options, and choose more durable items if they appeal to your dog. Real bones, yak milk chews, and bully sticks are all good options. Of course, you’ll want to monitor your dog’s chewing to be sure they’re not swallowing the pieces or otherwise harming themself. Always check with your veterinarian about what is safe for your particular dog, and what is good, rather than harmful, for their teeth.\n5. Learn More About Your Dog\nThe more you understand dogs, the easier it is to avoid misreading them and to successfully communicate with them. Brush up ondog body languageor learn more about cognition, training, and behavior. Adding to your dog knowledge will help you to clear up any confusion between the two of you or to figure out what they want. It’s especially helpful to be able to recognize signs that your dog is stressed,nervous, scared, or uncomfortable so you can alleviate the situation by changing the context, or removing them from it.\n6. Vary Your Dog’s Food\nThere’s plenty of debate about what constitutes thehealthiest diet for dogs. However, few disagree on the value of varying a dog’s food. If your dog can tolerate change in their diet, mixing things up a bit and addingfresh foodwill bring them serious joy. This applies totreatsas well; when I’m training, I often change up the treats. (Note: You know your dog; if GI issues require them to eat the same thing on a regular basis, this suggestion doesn’t apply.)\n7. Protect Your Pup From What They Dislike\nSome dogs love having a horde of children around them, but other dogs are miserable in that situation. Whether your dog objects to the ceiling fan, the sound of the kettle boiling, the doorbell or the cat eating their food, there are usually ways to avoid minor domestic irritations.\nIf your dog objects to being barked at through the fence by a neighbor’s dog while on a walk, take another route. If your dog hates having their matted fur combed out; make time each day to brush them so the mats don’t form in the first place. Many dogs are irritated by the constant jingling of their tags; tape the tags together or stow them in a tag-silencing pouch. Every dog is different, but if you figure out that something bothers your dog, find a way to shield them from it.\n8. Keep On Training\nYou’re never donetraininga dog. (Sorry,puppy classesaren’t enough.) Training involves so much more than teaching basic manners and skills, and it’s a process that can yield ongoing benefits. Dogs who are well trained can be given more freedom, have more opportunities to socialize and are able to go more places. They are less likely to become frustrated and confused if they know what you want them to do.\nOther rewards include relationship-building, increased self-esteem for your dog, and more pleasant visits to the vet — a well-trained dog can be examined and treated with less stress because they know how to respond to requests and require less (if any) physical manipulation.\n9. Rub Them The Right Way\nI’m always charmed by dogs’ contented sighs when they’re being rubbed inexactly the right spot. Many dogs love to have their hips, neck, chest, and the area just above their tail gently massaged.Read aboutor watch a how-to video oncanine massage or touch techniquesand put your new skills to use — your dog will thank you for it.\n10. Accept Them For Who They Are\nThere’s great happiness in being loved as you are rather than being pressured to be what you’re not (that’s as true for dogs as it is for people). So, if your dog loves to snuggle, let them; if your dog prefers their own space, don’t force them into cuddle time that only you enjoy. If your dog loves tug but is quickly bored by retrieving, accept that you have a dog who’s not interested in endless games of fetch. If your dog thinks they’re part cat when they’re near water and wants no part of that wetness, let go of your plans to spend Saturdays in the lake together. Your dog is who they are, and there’s no more profound way to increase their happiness than to let go of attempts to change them, and love them just the way they are.",

    "page_content": "Training a dog is hard work, and sometimes, it feels like there’s an army of folks conspiring against you, determined to derail your efforts. Maybe your dad loves to roughhouse with your dog, or your best friend encourages your dog to jump up on her every time she visits. It could be that your dog sitter forgets to give your dog a treat if they come when called, or your niece thinks it’s funny to chase your dog when they steal a sock and run away.\nOut of necessity, I have developed defensive strategies to prevent other people from wrecking both my own and my clients’ best-laid training plans — because the last thing you want is for your dog to lose the association between a cue you’ve taught them and the desired behavior. Here’s how to prevent other people from putting a wrench in your hard work.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHow to Know If a Cue Has Been Poisoned\nIt takes a lot of consistent work over many months to teach a dog a totally reliable recall — to come when calledevery single time. I like to think that for a well-trained dog, the cue “come!” means “Whatever I’ve got here, she’s got something better over there.” In actual practice, that level of perfection — the dog always receives something so wonderful that they are glad they came when called — is hard to achieve, but the goal is to be as close as possible.\nMany of us achieve a good recall with cues we don’t intentionally use. For example, lots of dogs come every time they hear the crinkle of a bag oftreatsor see uspick up the leash. To most dogs, those actions are linked with getting treats and going for a walk because of the exceptionally strong association between the cue and what follows.\nFrom the dog’s point of view, the spoken command “Come!” rarely predicts something so reliably great. This is partly because we’re up against other people who call our dogs-in-training to come and don’t reinforce them when they do so. Luckily, you can usually swamp these occasional “oops” moments with plenty of better experiences.\nThe real recall-killer, however, is calling a dog to come and then doing something that is aversive rather than reinforcing. When a dog isn’t sure if offering the behavior in response to a cue will lead to something good or to something bad, the cue has been poisoned, and the dog will resist responding to it. So, if a dog runs to a groomer who called them to “come” and then clips their nails and gives them a bath — both of which he hates — the cue is being poisoned. The aversive can be something obviously bad (being yelled at) as well as something less obviously negative (the end of playtime).\nA cue is rarely poisoned by just one or even a few misuses, but repeated bad experiences are a different story. Because it’s difficult to fix a poisoned cue, your best bet is to change it. Yes, it’s possible to reverse the dog’s negative association with a cue, but it’s less work to build a new association. For example, “Here!” or “This way!” are good alternatives to “come.”\nTeaching a New Response\nYears ago, I lived in an old farmhouse while it was being renovated, so workers were in the house with my dog, Bugsy, while I was at work. I knew and trusted these men, so I wasn’t worried about Bugsy’s safety and well being. In fact, the men loved my dog so much that their enthusiasm became a problem.\nEach time they arrived, there were effusive greetings all around, which included encouraging Bugsy to jump up on them. Bugsy was a big dog and the men got a kick out of how they could get his front paws on the their chests. The problem was that I didn’t want my dog’s front paws on anybody’s chest. In fact, after I adopted Bugsy, I spent months “de-jumping” him — teaching him not to jump up like that.\nA week into the remodel, I came home to a dog who jumped on me with great joy and enthusiasm. Though I was, of course, pleased to see Bugsy, the joy and enthusiasm were all his. I was totally joyless and unenthusiastic about the return of this behavior; among other things, I was concerned about him knocking over a child or my frail elderly neighbor, or upsetting people who like to keep their clothes free of dog prints.\nAlso, as a professional dog trainer who referred to Bugsy as “the best résumé I’ve ever had,” I saw a lot of awkwardness in my future. If he jumped on people during public appearances or when I was using him as a demonstration dog in group classes, I was going to look foolish. Immediate action was necessary. My first strategy — asking the guys not to encourage Bugsy to jump up on them and explaining the reasons why — had no effect.\nAfter observing that the men patted their chests to encourage Bugsy, I came up with a solution. I taught Bugsy to sit whenever people patted their chests. In other words, I wrecked the workers’ ability to invite Bugsy to jump up by making that action a cue to sit. After a few weeks, my efforts paid off. A fellow who had just started working with the crew told me that he tried to get my dog to jump up, patting his chest as he told me this, but that the silly mutt couldn’t seem to figure it out. He actually implied that maybe my dog was stupid because he sat instead. (It’s not my dog who can’t figure out what’s going on, I thought, with considerable satisfaction.)\nTo prevent the workers from finding another way to invite Bugsy to jump up, I showed them how to cue Bugsy to shake, wave, or high-five. Luckily, the guys found these tricks more entertaining than having Bugsy put his paws on their chests, so I didn’t have further problems.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nCreating Unique Cues\nWhen it comes to a defensive strategy, choosing atypical cues has an upside. If your cues are standard (“sit,” “heel,” “down,” “come”) and you use “okay” as a release for “stay” and “leave it,” then your dog is more vulnerable to training sabotage from other people. Someone can poison the cue or make it irrelevant by saying it endlessly even when the dog is clearly not going to respond. This often happens with “come” and also with “drop it,” which many people say to a dog who is holding something in their mouth. The result is that the dog learns that those sounds are meaningless, making it harder to teach them to respond appropriately in the future.\nIf you use unusual cues, or words in a foreign language, you protect yourself and your dog from these problems. How likely are most of us to come across people who try to communicate with our dogs using the Dutch “af,” meaning “down,” the French “ici” for “come” or the Czech “zustan” for “stay?” Avoiding the release word “okay” in favor of the less-common “free” or even a random choice such as “jailbreak!” or “all done” prevents interference from other people.\nStaying Proactive\nSpecific defensive strategies are useful, but none are as effective as taking charge of the situation and doing everything you can to be assertive about what happens around your dog. Few people are skilled in dog training, but for the most part, they mean no harm. (If someone is purposely wrecking your dog’s training, they don’t deserve to be around either of you.) Most people will do the right thing with some direction, and that can prevent them from causing training trouble.\nSo, manage the situation. That may mean preventing access to your dog, especially in your absence. It can also mean saying in a straightforward way, “He came when he was called, so give him this stuffed Kong,” as you hand it over.\nIf someone is encouraging your dog to steal things and play keep-away, tell them exactly what to do instead, and why: “This will teach them to make a game of stealing things, and I don’t want that. Instead, let’s encourage them to trade that sock for a handful of treats.”\nIf someone is playing rough with your dog, tell them, “They’re not allowed to play that way because they get too excited and start biting, but here’s a tug toy that they will like playing with even more.” If that fails to change the person’s behavior, you can intervene by enticing your dog into a game of tug with you, or by saying, “When they gets overly aroused like this, I put them in their crate with something to chew on so they can calm down,” and then do exactly that.\nDog training would be tricky enough if you could do it in a bubble with no interference from anyone else. As it happens, you do it in the real world where all kinds of unplanned challenges crop up. As frustrating as this can be, there are ways to counteract the actions of these would-be spoilers. Ultimately, you’re responsible for training your dog and protecting them from setbacks — any way you can.",

If you’re ready to beef up your pup’s résumé and teach them a new skill, there are many tricks that offer more than just cute performance opportunities; here’s a list of useful dog tricks that go beyond the basics.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nNine tricks to teach your dog\nTeaching your dog to crawl can be helpful as a way to clean themselves off. If you live with a dog who enjoys a good walk in the mud, ask your pup to crawl in some snow or grass to clean up a bit before heading inside.\nWhen your dog has mastered the handshake, you can ask your dog to present a paw on cue whencutting their nailsor at the vet to make a blood draw easier. It’s also useful for checking for pad injuries or just toweling off wet paws after a walk.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nThe “wait” cue instructs your dog to pause and not to move forward until given permission to do so. It can literally be a lifesaver at doors to both houses and cars because it canprevent bolting out into traffic. Additionally, “wait” can be a sanity-saver when heading out for a walk because it stops the chaos that naturally results from overly-excited dogs who are so eager to go out for a walk that they act like they are out of their minds.\nTeaching the “belly up” cue tells your dog to lie on their back with their legs in the air. If you have a dog that loves belly rubs, this is an easy one, but it can also help a vet perform an examination more easily.\nThis cute trick provides another way for a dog to expose their belly, and comes in handy when you need to pull off burrs or seeds. If your dog’s balance is good, “beg” can also be a way to position a dog for a quick brush of the belly fur.\nThis is a cue to your dog to tilt their head, which makes photos of dogs especially endearing no matter what position they’re in. The less time you spend trying to get dogs into specific poses, the more likely they are to have a friendly expression on their face.\nHaving your dog perform a play bow on cue is more than just a cute trick; it can also help a dog who is a bit awkward or nervous around other dogs. The play bow is a social signal that means “What follows is playful in nature,” and performing one near other dogs can help social interactions start off on the right paw, easing tensions caused by confusing or unexpected behavior.\nUp is a handy cue that tells your pup to jump or step onto something; it’s a great way to get big dogs to stand on thevet’s scale. It is even more helpful when combined with a solid stay, but that’s not always essential.\nThe “dry off” cue tells your dog to shake their whole body. This cue is helpful to have your dog shake off excess water before coming inside after a walk in the rain or a bath.\nBeing able to ask your dog to perform a behavior on cue makes many situations less anxiety-provoking. If your dog needs to perform a certain behavior, either for medical reasons or to further that fruitless, endless pursuit of cleanliness, it’s better to be able to communicate what we want than to physically manipulate them. Rather than grab them, lift them or push them around — however gently — it’s advantageous just to be able to tell your pup what you want and have them do it on their own through training. Tricks involve dogs putting their bodies (or at least parts of them!) in all sorts of positions, and that variety of movement and behavior is what gives dog tricks their practical value.",

To your dog, it’s like walking into a room filled with French pastries and desserts — and they’re free. But thosescavenged itemscan also be extraordinarily dangerous.\n“Leave it” is an essential cue that asks your dog to leave something alone and is up there among the mostuseful training cuesyou can teach your dog. Think of it this way: your dog might not stop chasing that deer into traffic on their own, but with an airtight leave-it cue, you can stop them in their tracks and save their life.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nSo whether it’s another dog, that slice of pizza on the edge of the counter, a squirrel, the person uninterested in your dog’s attention, or the cat’s poop, anything can be protected from unwanted attention with a well-practiced leave-it. Here’s a shortbasic dog trainingexercise you can practice with your dog every day to master this essential skill.\nTeach Your Dog “Leave It”\nLeave it is easy to teach to dogs and can prevent your dog from eating something that could hurt them. But before you get started, gather up your supplies: A hungry dog and two kinds of treats (a ordinary treat or biscuit and one far more delicious).\nBegin with one of the ordinary treats in an open palm. Lower it to where your dog can see it.\nWhen your dog tries to take the treat, close your hand around it. They will likely nudge at the treat. Ignore this behavior. Ignore any behavior attempting to pry the treat out of your hand. What you’re waiting for is even the slightest hesitation in interest.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nThe moment your dog shows even a fleeting second of hesitation in trying to wrestle that treat from your hand, you bring one of the better treats out in your other open palm. The dog gets this treat as a reward for that moment’s hesitation.\nIn repeating this dog training drill over the course of days or weeks, you are building up your dog’s skills by waiting for incrementally longer hesitations until it becomes clear they are beginning to understand. The goal is for your dog to show more restraint than they did the first time they were shown the treat.\nWhen your dog begins to show more restraint, you can begin to integrate the verbal cue, saying “leave it” when the dog is moving away from the first treat. If they listen the first time, they get the more delicious treat. If they don’t, the fist closes, you wait, and you try again together.\nMoving to the Next Level\nAs your dog’s skill progresses and they achieve a rock-solid “leave it” with treats in your palm, you can work on more advanced training. You can try this exercise but put the treat on the table or floor. Remember, your dog should get rewarded with the more delicious treat and not the one you are asking them to leave. When you are both up for another challenge, head outside and repeat these steps with treats or other temptations on the floor and, again, reward with a more delicious treat.\nAs with any dog training, don’t force the dog. Work slowly within the dog’s physical and emotional comfort zone to avoid falls. Training should be fun, and your dog will learn better if they’re happy and not frustrated. With a bit of time and patience, your dog can learn this life-saving cue.",

    "page_content": "For decades, a component of the current pet-dog training approach is the “play-before-you-train” model, wherein pet parents are advised to play with their pups —tug of war,fetch,chase games— before attending a training class. The idea is to take the edge off the dog’s energy so they’re more able to focus on the lessons.\nA calm demeanor makes it significantly easier for people to engage in the training course. Instead of spending time trying to force an angsty pup to cooperate, pet parents can maintain the dog’s attention and breeze through the class like a pro. But wait, if this practice is tried-and-true, what could possibly disrupt it? Turns out, we may have been doing things backward.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nStudying Post-Learning Play\nIn a 2017studyon playful activities after training sessions, researchers, including Dr.Nadja Affenzeller, found that play improved a dog’s training retention for 24 hours. To demonstrate this phenomenon, Dr. Affenzeller tested a small group of 11 Labrador Retrievers, ages three to 10 years old, in a “discrimination” task. This required the dog to choose between two different objects: a blue basket full of woodchips and a green box containing kitty litter.\nOnce the dogs were considered successful at the task, they either rested for 30 minutes in the presence of their person and one of the researchers, or were active for 30 minutes. Dogs in the “play” group did 10 minutes of walking on leash, then 10 minutes of off-leash play (fetch with a ball or with a disc or tug, depending on the dog’s preference), then 10 more minutes of walking on leash. The dogs in each group were monitored for salivary cortisol levels and heart rate to confirm that their states of physiological arousal were different. (They were.)\nIf your dog needs a job, trainers recommend Treibball.\nThe following day, all of the dogs were tested again to see how many trials it took them to relearn the task. The difference between the two groups was remarkable. The dogs who walked and played after training took an average of 26 trials to relearn the task. The dogs who rested after training needed an average of 43 trials to reach that same level of success. The differences could be a result of chemical changes in the brain.\nExpanding Training Success One Year Later.\nDr. Nadja Affenzeller’sfollow-up researchseems to not only confirm the previous results in an expanded study across one year, but has the potential to turn dog training as we know it on its head. This retention is facilitated by the release of adrenaline and the activation of specific parts of the dog’s sympathetic nervous system due to the excitement of playtime. Together, signals firing off in the nerve cells and amygdala (the part of the brain responsible for a pup’s emotions as well as some memory) seem to boost the dog’s long-term memory for up to a year.\nTake two of the adorable test subjects, Max and Poppy, for example. For the previous study, they had been trained to identify the blue woodchip-filled basket from among other objects presented to them. At the command, “Go,” Max and Poppy were required to place two paws close to their chosen item in at least 16 out of 20 trials to be considered successful.\nThere was a catch, though. Max and Poppy, along with the other nine dogs, had different experiences after their earlier training sessions. Whereas Max relaxed on a dog bed, Poppy was in the “play” group and taken for a walk and given an opportunity to play with her person.\nWhen they were tested with the same objects a year later, Poppy’s group, known as the “play group,” blew Max’s “resting group” out of the water. The playful pups only needed an average of 23 trials to refresh their memories in identifying their assigned objects. On the other hand, the resting dogs needed 50 trials on average to reach the same milestone. When Dr. Affenzeller further analyzed the data, she noted that Poppy and the rest of the playful dogs also made notably fewer errors in the second year’s test than Max and his chilled-out buddies.\nSince there were so few dogs in this study, it can only be considered an indicator for what may become a brand-new approach in pet-dog training. Still, the question remains: How is this important to dog ownership as it stands today?\nThe Significance of Behavioral Training in Human-Dog Relationships\nAcceptable behavior remains one of the major factors in people’s satisfaction with their canine companions. This is not only a matter of simple happiness within a given household, but also, an element that holds significant influence over a dog’s quality of life. Results of astudy released in 2008illustrated the degree to which training can affect a dog’s life, especially those who are on the sometimes difficult path toward finding their forever homes.\nExamination of a sample of 5,750 dogs rehomed by the UK-based Dogs Trust revealed that “behavioral problems” were the leading cause of the relinquishment of a pet to a shelter, accounting for 58.6 percent of returns. Of the 2,185 pups who were returned, this resulted in a profound life disruption for approximately 1,280 of them — a devastating number for something so preventable.\nA few minutes — or even a few steps — are all you need to add joy to your dog’s day.\nThe possibility of being surrendered to a shelter is not the only risk faced by dogs who do not receive adequate behavioral training. These pups are also vulnerable to being inappropriately abandoned or even euthanized if pet parents decide they’ve had enough. (More than 10 percent of dogs in the United Kingdom were returned, abandoned or euthanized as a direct result of personal dissatisfaction with behavior. Of those returned, 40 percent were eventually euthanized after living in the shelter for an extended period.)\nAnotherstudy in 2018revealed a similarly problematic relationship between Dutch pet parents’ satisfaction and unruly pets. After surveying 977 participants, researchers learned that disobedience and aggression were among the most prominent behavioral issues plaguing dog parents; both had significant negative correlations with pet parent satisfaction. Fortunately, most respondents (89 percent) reported having addressed these problems by using food and play during training (those who used play alone comprised 57 percent of training-course attendees).\nFormal training-course enrollment is not necessarily predictive of increased pet parent-satisfaction levels. However, this study illustrated that when pet parents are better equipped to train their dogs using appropriate aids (i.e., play and food), the odds of improving both dog behavior and pet parent happiness rise dramatically.\nAccording to results of asurvey distributed by Vet Street, most people train their dogs to some degree, either professionally (46.7 percent) or on their own (45.5 percent). Those who attend formal training courses often enroll in multi-course programs (47.5 percent). An additional 30 percent of dog parents extend training by several weeks to earn some type of official certification.\nGiven how widespread the inclination to train pet dogs is, and the significance this practice has for both the quality of the dog’s and human’s life, Dr. Affenzeller’s findings could lead to dramatic improvements in dog-training success in the years to come.\nIf pet parents can take advantage of such an easy training tool to achieve a higher level of agency in the quality and efficiency of training, we may begin to see a gradual downturn in the number of companion dogs surrendered. Further, as pet parents brace for the inevitable return to work after Covid-19 restrictions are safely lifted, they may face a reckoning when attempting to re-establish boundaries with overly bonded dogs. Effective behavioral training will be more important than ever to ensure that dogs and their human companions are able to maintain a positive quality of life into the short- and long-term future.",

They dig to bury things (like Ezra’s doing), for entertainment, to ease boredom, to cool off, and sometimes to escape. Here are a few strategies you can use to stop your dog from digging up the yard.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nFirst, show them where it is okay to dig.\nSince digging is such a natural behavior for dogs, it’s often easier to channel that urge to an appropriate place rather than to eliminate it completely. Make it easier and more tempting for Ezra to dig in a place you set up for that purpose. Create a digging area with sand, dirt, and treasures to make that location a better, more fun choice. Start by half-burying a bone,stuffed Kong, or another prized item in the designated area to teach your dog that it’s worth his time to dig there. As time goes on, you can make treasures harder to find, but it’s important that he have success right away, so he has good motivation to return to dig where he’s allowed (and encouraged) to do so.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nProvide plenty of enrichment.\nMany dogs dig when they’re bored. If they have other options, some will forego the digging. That means an essential part of dealing with a digging dog is to add activities to their day. There are two general approaches: work the body and work the mind. More physical exercise can make a huge difference, especially if it’s the kind of effort that really tires him out. Extra time on leashed walks is good, but running off-leash until he’s truly tired—chasing ballsor playing with a dog buddy—is often more effective at changing behavior.\nMental exercise is also an important part of keeping a dog from finding their own amusements, whether that’s burying socks or digging up plants. Chew toys,food puzzles, stuffed toys like Kongs, searching for hidden treats in the house, and training sessions are all ways to keep your dog’s mind busy.\nPreventing trouble is half the battle.\nManaging the situation, so your dog doesn’t have the opportunity to do what you don’t want him to do is a big piece of the puzzle. (This is true for any behavioral issue, by the way.) Management may include setting up barriers such as fencing or chicken wire around areas you do not want them to dig. It could also involve spraying a scent your dog doesn’t like around the area you seek to protect. (Tip:Many dogs don’t care for citrus scents.) If you have mice, shrews or any other little critters that make your yard smell delicious to your dogs, do what you can to remove them with humane and non-toxic methods. Finally, do all you can to keep socks—and any other treasures your dog likes to bury—out of reach.\nDon’t give him the freedom to make mistakes.\nFor now, while you’re teaching him this new habit, don’t allow him to be outside if you can’t supervise him or offer him something else to do. When you’re out in the yard together, give him afrozen stuffed Kongand observe how much time he spends on it. Once you know how long it will keep him occupied, you’ll know how long he can be outside without you. If you see him digging where he’s not allowed to, it’s essential that you react to it—redirect him to his own spot or involve him in some other activity instead.\nModel appropriate behaviors.\nMany dogs watch us dig in an area and then do the same thing. Until he learns that he may not dig in your garden or yard and is content to dig only in his specialdigging area, don’t let your dog observe you digging. What you see as undesirable behavior may just be his way of joining in the fun.\nThough digging is a natural dog behavior, it can be very inconvenient and irritating. The good news is that there’s a lot you can do to make the situation a happier one for both of you. A love of digging is part of who Ezra is, but you can train him to dig less and on your terms.",

    "page_content": "Mat training is a valuable skill for dogs that will seriously pay for the time you invested in teaching many times over. The goal of mat training is to send your dog to a safe spot, typically a mat or a blanket. So, on your cue—let’s say “Go to your mat”—your dog moves to find their mat, lying down and staying until the release signal is given.\nWhat are the benefits of mat training?\nThis versatile cue provides a calming alternative to unwanted behaviors (likebolting to the doorwhen someone knocks), helps give your dog a comforting spot when they need to take a little break, and helps you get them out from underfoot while you’re busy orhave guests.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nHaving mastered this trick can help your dog handle adventures away from home, too. Your dog learns that their mat (or blanket) is a safe and comfortable spot, so they will likely be more comfortable away from home if the mat goes, too. A mat provides many of the advantages of bringing theircratewith you wherever you go, but it is more portable, lighter, easier to carry, and can be taken lots of places that a crate can’t go. Now that you know the benefits, here’s what you need to know to get started mat training your dog.\nHow to mat train your dog\nNote that your dog should have a good “Down” and “Stay” under their collar before you begin. This exercise is a behavior chain in which we will initially reward for several different steps or links.\nAs you give thecue, “Go to Your Mat,” step toward the target (in this case, their mat) and use a treat to lure your dog toward it; mark with “yes” and reward as soon as they step onto the mat.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nImmediately follow with the cue “Down” and reward again. Release and repeat. Once your dog has the hang of these first two steps, you’ll work on distance training.\nIn small increments, gradually increase your distance from the mat, encouraging your dog to step out ahead toward it and anticipate the down once there. It may be helpful at this point to toss the treat onto the mat as you give the cue. This will encourage your dog to seek it out and complete the behavior on their own.\nOnce your dog shows that they grasp the concept by moving ahead to reach the mat and anticipating the down, add the last link in the chain by signaling them to “Stay” after the down.\nWhen all the behavior links are in place, continue to strengthen the exercise by reinforcing increased targeting distance, increased stay duration and tolerance to distraction while staying.",

I could get a different coffee and haircut every day of the week and never leave my local neighborhood. This is great, in theory, but how do I choose the best place for my morning latte? Who should I trust to get my hair faded just right?\nChoice is also a benefit when you’re looking for a dog trainer, but you can end up facing the same kind of issues, with a lot more riding on the outcome than a bitter drink or a less-than-stellar ’do.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nSo how do we find the right trainer if we have only Google to go on? Online reviews are hardly fair and balanced, but we don’t always have the luxury of a personal recommendation. The answer is to learn how to interpret the language used on dog-training websites.\nUnderstanding Dog Trainer Language\nThink of a trainer’s website as an infomercial. Although we know it’s designed to convince us to sign up, if we’re savvy we can also pick through the language to find clues about a trainer’s methods and beliefs. Let’s start with the most common word, one that pops up on almost every trainer’s site:effective.\nOf course, we all want our dog trainer to be effective. Who would sign up for Dave’s Ineffective Dog Training? We’re spending time and money trying to help our dogs become well-mannered citizens, and we don’t want to feel like our efforts have been wasted. However, there are many different ways to accomplish training goals, some more fraught with potential pitfalls than others. Efficacy is important, but ethics are important too, and are something that trainers also reflect in their word choice.\nWords likecompassionate,fairandhumaneindicate what trainers believe about themselves, but they don’t add much clarity for potential clients. All three are subjective terms; what I believe represents compassionate training might not be what you envision. Besides, what counts as humane and compassionate is determined by a trainer’s beliefs about how dogs learn and how best to teach them, so these words raise questions rather than answer them.\nTrainers also use a relatively small number of more specific, objective-sounding terms on their sites. Because these can provide a general idea of the kinds of things that might happen to a dog during training, it’s useful to understand what they mean. Following is a list of the most commonly used.\nFORCE-FREE/POSITIVE\nTrainers who describe themselves as “force-free,” or some variation of “purely positive,” will never deliberately use pain or fear in their training. They will focus on finding ways to reward a good behavior that is incompatible with the behavior they don’t want to see, like sitting politely instead of jumping up on guests. Often, they’ll use a clicker and treats, paired with ignoring the dog when he’s doing something inappropriate.\nThe key thing to remember here is that although these trainers might see themselves as using only positive, gentle methods, what really matters is how the dog sees things. Force-free trainers who put clients’ dogs in situations where they feel uncomfortable or who can’t teach their guardians the skills required to carry on after the session can cause frustration and anxiety and even reinforce undesirable behavior.\nBALANCED\nTrainers who describe themselves as “balanced” may use everything from electronic collars to clickers in their approach. The balance here is between things designed to punish bad behavior and things designed to reward good behavior. However, not all balanced trainers will use every tool or the same balance of rewards and punishments. Some will use punishment only in certain cases, others will use it most of the time. Many balanced trainers make distinctions among different breeds of dogs or different types of problems that they believe won’t respond to the kinds of reward-based approaches on which force-free trainers rely.\nFor example, many balanced trainers claim that although dogs can learn tricks using a clicker and treats, they can be taught to avoid rattlesnakes only by associating the snakes with something unpleasant, like a shock. Force-free trainers strongly disagree with claims like this, which has led to serious rifts within the dog-training community.\nLIMA AND HUMANE HIERARCHY\nThese terms are less common than the previous two, but they are gaining traction in professional circles as a way to explain both an ethical stance and a practical approach to dog training.\nLIMA stands for “Least Invasive Minimally Aversive,” meaning that with any set of possible interventions, the trainer will always try whatever is least likely to cause pain or punishment first, only moving to more potentially unpleasant options if they feel the need. (This position is endorsed by theInternational Association of Animal Behavior Consultantsand theAssociation of Pet Dog Trainers.)\nThe Humane Hierarchy was developed by Dr. Susan Friedman* as one way of organizing potential interventions, from most to least punishing. A trainer who uses these terms is engaged with the latest thinking on ethics and wants to display this engagement to potential clients. It’s very unlikely that trainers who align themselves with LIMA will use punishment, especially for basic obedience issues.\nBOOT CAMP (and other military terms)\nThis kind of language usually suggests that the trainer believes in punishment as the best way to manage behavior. Trainers who sell themselves as providing this type of intervention often also subscribe to ideas about dominance and “being the alpha.” They appeal to frustrated pet parents who are faced with dogs who seem rude and out-of-control, but their approaches can be harsh and lead to suppression, not modification. Trainers who describe themselves or their approach in this controlling, militaristic language are probably best avoided altogether.\nThere Is No Substitute for Substance\nAlthough being able to parse these terms and understand them gives us more of a picture of how a trainer operates than the words “humane and effective,” it’s clear that each label still represents a spectrum of beliefs and approaches.\nThe only way to get the clearest possible information is to ask trainers directly. That means you’ve got to shop around, get in front of trainers, and ask unambiguous and substantial questions about what is going to happen to your dog, and why. Dog behavior consultant John McGuigan proposes the following questions, which every trainer ought to easily be able to answer: What will happen to my dog if she gets it right? What will happen to my dog if she gets it wrong? Are there less invasive alternatives to what you propose?\nThese questions don’t cover everything, and they can’t inoculate you against a marketing spiel, but they’re a good place to start. If you’re not comfortable with the answers you get; if the trainer becomes evasive and starts using concepts like “energy,” talking around the question or invoking his or her years of experience; or if the answer involves anything that is designed to cause pain, to startle or to do anything else unpleasant, think twice. It’s your responsibility to exercise due diligence when choosing a dog trainer, and it’s always better to risk being seen as a busybody than it is to put your dog in a situation you didn’t want or expect.\n*Susan Friedman, PhD, professor emeritus in psychology at Utah State University, introduced the concept of the Humane Hierarchy in her paper, “What’s Wrong with This Picture? Effectiveness Is Not Enough.” Published in the Journal of Applied Companion Animal Behavior in 2009, it immediately became a benchmark in the assessment of behavior-modification protocols. Dr. Friedman is considered a pioneer in the application of humane, effective behavior-modification techniques to a variety of animal species. Her online seminars and lectures are available to professional animal behaviorists throughBehaviorWorks.organd as part of the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants’ “Principles and Practice” curriculum. With Steve Martin, Dr. Friedman also leads hands-on workshops for Natural Encounters.",

    },
    "page_content": "Putting your dog on a coffee table is probably the last thing you’d consider when training your dog, but platform dog training is a foundational skill and a popular technique with dog trainers.\nWith platform dog training, you can teach your doguseful cueslike to lie down on their bed, to sit or stand on a platform, or to stand in front of you attentively. You might use this when asking your dog to keep away from the door when visitors come in or if you’re having dinner and ask your pup to go to their place and stay in their bed. It’s convenient if you’re in a vet’s waiting room, you can ask your dog to lie down by your feet on their blanket. Training your pup with these skills provides them with something familiar and comforting.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nPlatform dog training might seem a bit intimidating, especially if you’re a new pet parent, but read on, and you’ll see how it can be exceptionally beneficial to your pup.\nWhat is platform dog training?\nPlatform dog training, also known as stationing, is a type of cue dog trainers use when asking a dog to sit or stand still in a specific spot. The spot can be atraining mat, a dog bed, or, as the name suggests, a platform, and you can send a dog there with a simple command. An elevated platform can be used in combination with a mat or a dog bed.\nGetting started with platform dog training.\nThere are plenty of things around the home you can use as a dog training platform, like an old coffee table, an ottoman, a durable box, or you can buy a specific dog-training platform. What matters most is that the surface is non-slip so that way your pup doesn’t slide across it.\nManybasic dog obedience tricks, like stay, sit, and down, can be taught using a platform. But one of the best cues to start with when training your dog on a platform is “attention.” It might sound simple, but having your dog stand right in front of you, giving you theirattention, is an essential skill. If you have a dog’s attention, you can train them to do just about anything; without it, the likelihood of teaching them much of anything is nearly zero. That’s why training your dog to give their attention by standing in front of you, looking at you, being calm, and waiting for a cue is so helpful.\nWhen your dog is on the platform, you can reward the attention given with a high-value treat at a high rate of reinforcement. While it might seem like “they’re not even doing anything,” they are actually doing so much. The behavior isn’t flashy, but to have a dog focusing on you and eager to work is amazing and should be reinforced if you want it to occur in the future. Don’t ever take this behavior for granted.\nWhat are the benefits of platform dog training?\nStationing on a platform is hugely beneficial in dog training. It can facilitate a calm and controlled environment, help dogs keep attention and focus, learn patience, and gives you, as the trainer, the opportunity to hit the reset button if things aren’t hitting the mark.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nThe main reason dog trainers love platform training is the focus and attention dogs give while in station. When dogs get used to working in a particular place like a platform, they tend to enter training mode as soon as they jump onto the platform. Their associations with these locations prepare them for what’s coming: “Okay, let’s train! What am I going to learn today?” When a dog is up on a raised surface, they are also contained to some degree, which makes training easier. They are less likely to wander off, sniff the ground or interact with anyone other than the trainer right in front of them.\nStationing allows order to emerge from chaos when working with multiple animals simultaneously. When each dog has a station, or a place to call their own, they can be kept at a distance from one another, preventing scuffles, negative interactions, or from becoming overwhelmed.Dog introductionsare also easier with platforms because dogs can each be in a stable location where they can get used to each other at a distance.\nStations are also handy for teaching dogs to wait, it helps prevent them from becoming frustrated. They understand that when they are waiting to train, there is nothing they can do to earn treats. It helps them feel more relaxed than if they think they may have an opportunity.\nIf something goes awry in a training session—an unclear cue, a poorly timed reinforcement or other miscommunication between the trainer and the dog—it’s easy for a dog to get confused or lose some confidence. Asking a dog to go to the platform or their bed can act like an eraser for that bad moment. Stationing gives trainer and trainee a fresh start, and it is not unusual for professional dog trainers to use a quick return to the platform as a reset button.",

    },
    "page_content": "We have a seven-year-old, 45-pound Lab/Husky mix and live in a condo with a spiral staircase. Our dog does not like the spiral staircase and will not use it. We tried training her ourselves, and we even hired a trainer, but no dice. Because she likes being close to us, we eventually started carrying her up and down the stairs every day, but recently, she’s become increasingly unhappy about being physically transported. Is there another way to approach this?\nThe openness of a spiral staircase frightens many dogs (and people, too). But often, you’re stuck with them. Luckily, most dogs respond well if they are taught how to negotiate stairs in an (appropriately named) step-by-step process. Here are ways to work toward that goal.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nFirst, make the stairs less frightening.\nThe terrifying view from an open staircase can be improved by covering the gaps between the railings and the risers with poster board or cardboard. When dogs can’t see the open space or the floor below, it’s easier for them to be more confident and to overcome their fear. Adding non-slip treads is also helpful; spiral staircase steps vary in width, so treads make slipping less likely and the stairs less scary.\nAssociate being picked up with feeling happy.\nYou can train your dog to handle spiral stairs, but first, she’ll need to be comfortable with being picked up. Begin by taking a step toward her and tossing treats. When she seems happy about your one-step approach, take two steps and toss treats. Treating all the while, progress gradually until you’re able to walk right up to her, touch her and then pick her up. Don’t bring your pup upstairs during this training interval; a negative experience will undo all your hard work. Some dogs respond well to having a cue that alerts them to being lifted up, making it less of a surprise. A phrase such as “Up we go!” or “Time for bed!” lets them know what’s happening.\nThere are several ways to safely lift a medium-sized dog, and it’s worth figuring out which way your dog is most comfortable with. Never lift a dog by their legs, collar, tail, or by reaching under their armpit area (like you’d pick up a child). Support their entire body, with one arm under their chest and the other under their back end. Some dogs feel more secure being carried while wrapped in a towel or blanket, but others squirm and are hard to hold onto when wrapped. If you don’t already know, see how your dog reacts to that approach.\nIt’s possible that your dog’s recent objections to being carried relate to a feeling ofpain or discomfort. At seven, she’s no longer young, which makes this more likely. Check with your veterinarian to see if the pain may be making her object to being carried.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nNext, give training another try.\nEven though your earlier training attempts were unsuccessful, you should revisit training. Set her up for little successes as you work toward the goal of a dog who confidently navigates stairs. If your dog is not already good at going up and down regular (non-spiral or open) stairs, start by helping her become comfortable with them. Only then should you work on training her to deal with spiral stairs. Here are some tips ontraining your dog to use stairs.\nStart with just a single step.\nOnce your dog is comfortable with regular stairs and with being picked up, carry her up the spiral stairs but set her down, so there’s just one more step to climb. (Keep her on the outside of the step, which gives her more paw room.) Lure her up the last step so that she succeeds in getting herself to the top “by herself,” even if it is just from the second-to-last step.\nBuild on their success with each step.\nWhen she can do this confidently, set her down two steps short of the top. Keep working on adding steps as she becomes adept at the previous level of difficulty.\nGoing downstairs can be scary too.\nOnce she can go up the stairs, repeat the process going down. Start by setting her down with only one more step to negotiate. You can also begin this part of the process while you are downstairs by lifting her and putting her on the bottom step, so she’s heading down toward you. Don’t attempt to teach her to go down from the very top (where the view seems a bit scary) until she has mastered starting at the bottom.\nThere are multiple ways to help your dog so that the spiral staircase is less scary, associating pick-ups with treats and training her to go up and down the stairs herself. As is so often the case, the key concept to dog training is patience. Work slowly within the dog’s physical and emotional comfort zone to avoid falls. Be patient, only progressing to the next task when the dog is clearly comfortable with the current one.",

Replace the treat lure with your empty hand doing the hand signal, and lure your dog around again, rewarding only once the spin is completed. When this “clicks” with your dog, you’ll be able to move your hand signal father away.\nNote: If your dog can follow the lure throughout the circle on the first go, they may not need those first rewards at 6 o’clock, then at 3 o’clock, etc. But, if your dog doesn’t follow the lure, work slower to keep their attention.",

Frankly, I don’t see how either of us will survive if she can’t run off her extra energy. What can we do?\nVets will often advise that you restrict your dog’s activity following surgery or while they recuperate from muscle or joint injuries. But the prospect of living with an underexercised dog who chews, whines,barks, or develops some other equally annoying habit to pass the time can be more alarming than the original medical problem. The devil really does find work for idle paws. Here's what you can do:\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nGet clear on your dog's restrictions.\nFirst, ask your vet to tell you exactly what your dog can and cannot do. Clearly, two-hour romps through the woods with her dog buddies will have to wait until she has recovered, but is a daily 10-minute leash walk allowed? Can sheswim? Are stairs completely off-limits?\nGive your dog's brain a workout.\nWithout being able to give your dog the physical exercise she's accustomed to, the key to keeping you both sane lies in exercising her mind. Mental exercise can take many forms. Time spent doing simple obedience is great for dog brains, plus you reap the benefits of having a better-trained dog. Ask your dog to sit, stay, lie down, or anything else she knows how to do to earntreats, toys, a trip outside, or a belly rub. A weekly class to learn new skills is a great motivator and can provide stimulation for your dog during her exercise quarantine.\nTeach your dog new tricks.\nTricks are another way to get your dog thinking, and can be a playful diversion for both of you. Learning tricks challenges the mind and makes many dogs tired, even without physical exercise. Some of my favorites are crawl, spin, beg, rollover, wave, shake, and high-five. (Of course, choose tricks that do not compromise your dog’s recuperation.) For example, if she likes to retrieve and is into toys, teach her the names of all her toys so that you can tell her to go get a specific one. Or, teach her to bring you a tissue when you sneeze. A flashy trick is to teach your dog to clean up by putting each of her toys, one at a time, into a toy basket.\nMake mealtime mental exercise.\nRather than just plunking a bowl down in front of your dog, feed her in a way that keeps her busy. Putting her food intoKongs, Goodie Balls, Roll-a-Treat Balls, or Buster Cubes so she has to work to get it out can keep her occupied for a long time. Learning how to get the food out is mentally engaging, and if you use different items and pack the food into them in different ways, your dog will get the maximum benefit. Even freezing her food inside a Kong or Goodie Ball will make eating a longer-lasting, more challenging endeavor.\nThe bottom line: Boredom is the enemy of the well-behaved dog. As long as your dog is using her mind, whether it’s to play, eat, or work, she is getting the mental exercise that helps her nap on the rug in front of the fire — instead of chewing it up.",

We decided to name herTurtle, as she arrived in June, when all the baby turtles hatch on our lawn.\nIn my intense preparation before her arrival, and with lots of pandemic time to kill, I became obsessed with a cult training protocol:Puppy Culture. The basic philosophy is that you have the ability to affect a dog’s life by what you choose to teach them in the first 12 weeks of life (called “The Critical Imprint Period”). The teachings explain that “during this brief window, it takes only the lightest touch to make a permanent impression on your puppy.” No pressure.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nI wanted to raise Turtle to be trainable, confident, and sweet-natured. Many common dog issues (aggression, destruction, separation anxiety) stem from fear and past negative experiences, and I wanted to use training as a way to build up positive experiences and create a strong communication bond between us. So ever since she arrived at eight weeks old, we used every single mealtime as training time to learn new tricks. It started off small, from teaching the meaning of the clicker, to progressively more advanced tricks.\nI’ll always remember her at around nine weeks — I was teaching her to ring a bell when I could see the eureka moment in her little head. She knew she had to offer a behavior I wanted (ring the bell), in order to get what she wanted (a click from me = the delicious morsel of chicken). From that moment on, teaching tricks became like a language we both understood, and followed the same formula: Use the clicker to hone in on the desired action, up the criteria (duration and/or place), label it with a verbal and hand cue,voila.\nFrom there, I have taught her to open and close a door. She rings the bell to go potty. I have taught her to count the number of pieces of kibble in front of her (up to four) using recordable voice buttons. She has learned to put away her toys in a basket on cue. The most useful, albeit boring, trick is the competition style ‘heel,’ which gets her in position on my left side parallel to my feet. Currently she is learning to limp, by lifting up her front paw, and walking. That particular trick requires her to build some more muscle memory and will take some time. To be honest, she’s so smart that she refuses to do any of these things for free. So we go througha lotof treats.\nWhat’s the point of all these tricks? The point is the fun of the learning in itself, and that she is burning off real energy. After a particularly challenging session — that she eventually masters — she beams with pride and actually jumps for joy. A tired dog is a happy dog, and metal activity will tire your dog out just as much as a round of fetch. I don’t know if my early training has changed the outcome of who she will be, but I hope so. I love her spunky and smart personality, and hope I’ve made a small difference somehow.",

    "page_content": "It takes two to pull. When your dog pulls on their leash and barrels ahead, you’ll likely either run to catch up or pull back. If you try to catch up with your dog, that encourages them to keep pulling on the leash. And if you pull back on the leash, well, you’ll just be playing a game of tug of war. But there’s a better solution: leash belay.\nWhat is Leash Belay?\nBelaying, a rock-climbing technique that involves attaching a running line to the climber’s harness, can also be used to walk dogs. It’s gentle on the most excitable pups as well as on the hands that hold the leash.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nTrainer Grisha Stewart is pioneering ways to apply those benefits in her already well-knownBehavior Adjustment Training(BAT) approach.BATrelies on positive reinforcement and leash skills to help anxious dogs feel more confident as they explore triggers.Teaching your dog to walk without pullingon the leash will require a lot of patience and practice, but it can be done.\nCentral to the new method is a small metal carabiner and an o-ring or two (or a similar climbing device). Instead of the leash sliding through your hands, it feeds through the o-ring, which absorbs the friction that causes rope burn. The basic moves for the handler are belaying—sliding the leash through the device—and braking with a smooth stop.\nDog trainer Karen B. London promises you’re not doomed to be pulled down the street forever.\nBenefits of Leash Belay\nBelaying can boost leash-handling skills with a few simple pieces of equipment and lots of indoor practice in shortening and letting out the line. Unlike older, aversive leash training modes that use a leash pop to correct a dog’s sudden surge, belaying is a “least intrusive” approach, nudging the dog toward better behavior. Think slow stops and less jerking of the leash.\nDynamic climbing rope (stretchier than standard rope leads… see below)\nDynamic climbing rope (stretchier than standard rope leads… see below)\nO ring(s)\nO ring(s)\nLeash tab\nLeash tab\nLocking carabiner\nLocking carabiner\nBelts: Skijoring, CaniX\nBelts: Skijoring, CaniX\nSuper-strong belay devices: Beal birdie, ATC, figure 8 descender\nSuper-strong belay devices: Beal birdie, ATC, figure 8 descender\nRound leashes, which slide the most easily, pair best with the different devices. A 15-foot rope leash is used in BAT sessions, and to those familiar with BAT, tab belaying will feel most similar. A tab can be used with a shorter leash, but Stewart recommends that the leash be at least eight feet to allow enough braking time.\nHow Does Leash Belaying Work?\nBy testing her ideas with other trainers and different types of dogs, Stewart has come up with two belaying methods: belt and handle. Inthis video, you will find full detailed instructions on how to use these two new methods to redirect a dog that pulls.\nThis is good for large dogs. The force of the dog’s pull is moved entirely off the handler’s arms, while hands are left free for other tasks. A carabiner can be hooked to a hip belt. To brake with the carabiner, the handler creates a V-shape with the lead.\nA simpler version is the leash tab—basically, a handle with a clasp that attaches to a ring added to the leash. This keeps two handles—and hands—in play. The ring should be just big enough to slide easily. A second ring can be used as a brake, which you create by looping the leash handle through it (a tip suggested by leash designer Trisha Case ofTrailblazing Tails).\nBehavior Adjustment Training (B.A.T.) will keep your dog calm in any situation. For real.\nWorking with Large or Reactive Dogs\nWhat if you have a thrashing shark on the other end? No need to reel the dog in. Just shorten the line by walking up the leash, then reinforce heeling or another calm behavior, Stewart suggests. Offer treats or praise for slowing even a little. And aim to stay far enough from triggers to prevent reactivity in the first place.\nLarger dogs who pull, especially those with whiplash-like reactions, can require maximum stopping power. This is where a hip belt and a heavy-duty belay device comes in. A regular belt (or even two collars hooked together) can be used, but a skijoring or CaniX belt is ideal, as they sit lower on the hips and stay put rather than ride up under your ribcage.\nWith a locking carabiner hooked to the belt, you can attach a super-strong belay device like a figure 8 descender or ATC to feed the line through more slowly. Pulling in your elbows will quickly stop the dog. The best, albeit the costliest, of these belay devices is a “beal birdie,” a climbing device with an autostop that does its job even if your hands are off the leash.\nIt all depends on you and your dog. Some will prefer the travel-light style found with the tab; others will embrace the protection of top-notch climbing gear. There are many ways to combine these tools and techniques, and new tweaks will surely be added now that climbing has gone to the dogs.\nTips on Using Leash Belay\nLean back, locking the ring in place. To disengage, maneuver the line forward so the ring falls. Tying a knot in the leash will prevent the ring from hitting your hand. For strong pullers or jumpy types, a second ring is a good option, but Stewart advises watching a dog closely so you can engage the brake before the dog bolts. The line should be fed out far enough to allow extra time for stopping.\nWhen cueing the dog to change direction or stop, slide the leash hand-under-hand toward you. Slow stops, which are important for keeping dog and human in balance, are accomplished by squeezing down while letting out just enough line to brake gently.",

    "page_content": "It’s easy to assume that you know how to train your pup effectively, especially when you’re seeing some progress. But, even the best pet parents make mistakes when dog training. Some blunders are only minor hiccups in your life-long dog training adventure, while others can cause a significant setback, putting you and your dog at square one. Here are nine dog training mistakes you should learn to avoid.\n1. Making training sessions too long.\nMultiple short training sessions are better than one long one, but many novice trainers don’t realize that when trainers say “short sessions,” they mean 30 to 90 seconds, not 20 minutes or more. You might be surprised to learn this because weekly training classes are often 45 to 60 minutes long. But, that class standard reflects logistics and convenience — nobody could (or would) come to a training center multiple times a day — so trainers meet in longer group classes. The term “micro-sessions” is more appropriate than “short sessions.”\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\n2. Delivering treats too slowly.\nYou ask your dog to lie down and they do, but by the time you give them a treat, they’re jumping up toward your face. What do they think earned them that treat? Jumping up at you. Similarly, if you call your dog to come and they head right to you and sit, they may think sitting in front of you is the behavior you’re so pleased about. Sitting is a lovely behavior, but if you’re working on their recall, you want to make sure it’s clear to them that coming when called is the behavior you want.\nThere are two ways to solve these sorts of problems, and both involve timing. Focus on delivering the treatimmediatelyafter the behavior you like (lying down, coming to you) and before your dog has time to throw another behavior (jumping up, sitting in front of you). Or use a marker, such as aclickeror a word “yes,” at the exact moment your dog does what you want. Either of these will tell them what they did to earn that treat.\nPro tips on training your dog with the click of a button — literally.\n3. Misplacing treat delivery.\nFor example, when working on heeling, it’s better to deliver treats with the hand that’s on the same side as your dog, so they don’t need to cross in front of you (and get out of position) to get it. Also, when learning proper stationing behavior, it’s common for dogs to be a little pushy in their enthusiasm to reach the treats, or even the treat bag. By aiming a bit below or behind their mouth, you will encourage your dog to back up, and to learn that this is the spot where good things are delivered. Follow the general rule of delivering the treat where you want your dog to be.\n4. Punishing desirable behavior.\nWhen I say it’s a common mistake to punish behavior we like, I’m not talking about those who are, sadly, still using physical punishment to train dogs. But even well-intentioned trainers who use positive reinforcement and have no intention of punishing a dog commit this faux pas. Any time the consequence of a behavior is something a dog doesn’t like, the behavior is less likely to happen again. Technically, this is called “positive punishment,” as distinguished from “negative punishment,” or removing something good as a consequence of a behavior. Both types of punishment reduce the frequency of the behavior they follow.\nHere’s a common scenario: People commonly call their dogs to come, then subject them to something they don’t like, such as nail trims or baths. Another is patting a dog on the head after they respond to a cue; most dogs don’t care to bepatted on the head. Besides making the dog less likely to perform the good behavior (say, coming when called) in the future, you may actually be “poisoning” the cue. That means that you’re teaching the dog to associate a cue (“come”) with something unpleasant. This is also common with the cue “drop it,” which many dogs have learned to associate with having things taken away from them. Always make sure that the consequence of a behavior you want to keep seeing is something that the dog enjoys.\n5. Reinforcing unwanted behavior.\nIt’s all too easy to allow a dog’s unfortunate behavior to work for them. One example of this is allowing a dog to pull while on leash; the behavior is reinforced because it gets them what they want—going the direction they desire, going faster or catching up with that cat. Or, reinforcing barking by giving the dog attention in response to it. Similarly, laughing, petting or sweet-talking a dog when they jump up makes that behavior more likely to happen. Don’t let the behavior you don’t want work for your dog, or they will keep doing it.\n6. Failing to teach a dog to generalize.\nAsking for a behavior that’s too hard for a dog at a particular moment is a very common training mistake: “I don’t know why they’re not doing it. I know they know it!” The behavior in question is almost always something that many dogs are taught, such as sit, down, stay or come.\nThe thing is, even though many dogs are taught to do these behaviors, they’re not always taught to do them in a fully fluent, generalized way. This means that even though a dog responds to a cue in a familiar environment, they may not be able to do so in other locations or situations. A dog who can lie down at home may not be able to do so while on a walk or when visitors come over. They may come when called in the backyard but not at the dog park.\nThis is completely normal and to be expected, but not everybody knows this, so they ask for a behavior in a new context without understanding that dogs have to learn to generalize their skills to new situations and higher levels of distraction.\nA lot of training is not about teaching a dog to perform a behavior on cue, but rather, teaching a dog to be able to perform that behavior on cue regardless of where they are or what’s going on around them. It’s critical to adjust your expectations based on the situation and the level of distraction as you work on teaching your dog to generalize what they know.\n7. Using only treats as a reinforcement.\nTreats are wonderful for training because they are so reinforcing to most dogs. I use treats a lot and think being generous with them is an important part of productive and happy training sessions. However, the use of other types of reinforcement can be a very powerful addition to training. Physical contact the dog enjoys, new toys, aplay sessionor getting to go outside can expand your dog’s willingness to work and help you do a better job of teaching them. Yes, treats are a great reinforcer and by far the most commonly used by almost all trainers, but using only treats limits the potential effectiveness and fun of training.\nPost-training play may extend a dog’s memory of previously learned behaviors by up to a year.\n8. Being inconsistent with cues.\nTraining always benefits from clear communication. In training dogs, you face a challenge that’s super obvious but often overlooked: communicating across species. That’s hard, and the potential for confusion is ever-present. Simply being consistent with cues goes a long way toward alleviating problems that come from misunderstandings.\nIf your cue for a recall is “come,” use that exact word every time. Don’t change it up by saying “c’mere” or “c’mon.” Similarly, if your cue to stay involves holding up your hand with your fingers spread and open palm facing her, it’s not fair to expect her to know that’s what you mean when you give the cue while holding your car keys. That’s confusing to dogs, but people do it all the time, leading to frustration on the part of both person and dog.\n9. Bribing instead of reinforcing.\nReinforcement is a desirable consequence of a behavior that makes that behavior more likely to happen in the future. It is a fundamental part of dog training. Bribery, on the other hand, is a promise of something good if a behavior is performed. Dangling a treat to get a dog to do what you want is bribery and often results in a dog who will only do what’s asked if they’re shown the goods upfront.\nAn especially problematic but common error is to ask a dog to do something, such as give a high-five, then, when they don’t do it, pull out a treat and give the high-five cue again. When the dog responds, they get the treat. This practice results in a dog who will only offer the behavior if they see the reward. The difference between reinforcement and bribery is huge; only the former will lead to a well-trained dog.\nThese common training mistakes can make training more challenging for both you and your dog, but the good news is that changing just a few details can make a huge difference in your dog’s behavior and in the joy you share during training. The result is that the relationship between the two of you becomes even better, and that’s the best possible outcome of great training.",

    "page_content": "Most people have a favorite breed of dog, or at least an image that leaps to mind when they think of a “good boy.” This favoritism is often based on aesthetics, even though all dog breeds have different dispositions, talents, and tendencies. The question is, how strong are a breed’s behavioral predispositions? And is it worth trying to convince them to behave differently just so you can have your “perfect” buddy?\nCan you teach a Spaniel tocomeon command when there's a grouse in the thicket? Will a sheep-guarding Komodor ever be chill with having other dogs over for a playdate? Can training override genetics? Is it nurture or nature? It's a question humanity has wrestled with ever since they realized that parenting is more than sharing meat scraps around the fire. But experts think it's worth understanding both sides of the debate when dog training.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nThere are probably limits to what you can teach certain breeds to do, for their and your sanity. Can you teach your Yorkie to back a bull into a truck? Probably not. Would your adolescent Border Collie be the perfect pet for an elderly couple who live in the city? If you know any thinking about getting one, please try to reason with them.\nIf your heart is set on a purebred pup, start your search at breed-specific rescue organizations.\nYes, knowing a dog’s breed may help make predictions about individual behavior, but plenty of Labradors won't fetch, and plenty of Greyhounds won’t run, even without training to discourage them. Overall, though, a dog's breed does a reasonably good job predicting an individual’s size, shape, and behavioral tendencies — Spaniels tend to be especially interested in birds and small game, Terriers love to dig, and Retrievers…well, you know. Breeds are merely subsets of all possible genetic combinations in the group of animals that we call dogs, or the speciesCanis lupus familiaris. We don’t expect dogs to fly, live underwater or turn into butterflies because we all know that dogs are four-legged mammals who come looking and acting pretty much like Benji or Rin Tin Tin.\n“Seventy percent chance of rain showers today” doesn’t tell you it’s going torain. It just says it’s more likely to than not. It’s a similar process with the behavior of our dogs. Can your German Shorthaired Pointer be taught to come reliably every time you call while the two of you are walking in the woods? Well, it depends. His breed allows us to make our first prediction — GSPs were bred to work with a lot more independence than Retrievers or Border Collies, and it’s no surprise to anyone that, in general, they are harder to train to come when called than a dog who was bred to work at your side.\nHowever, even within a breed, individual dogs are not clones. Most GSPs quiver at the thought of chasing after a bevy of quail, but there are always a few who haven’t read the breed description. That’s true of individuals in every breed. Not all Greyhounds are passionate about running after a rabbit, and not all Border Collies obsessively herd the house cat. There is a tremendous amount of individual variation within a breed, and each individual’s genetic inheritance creates behavioral predispositions that are stronger in some cases, weaker in others.\nPuppy mills and animal traffickers are tricking Craigslist users into purchasing dangerously — sometimes terminally — sick dogs.\nSo, the simplest answer is you can research and prepare for the expectations of your dog's breed to know what it's capable of — and then, you can get to know your pet and see what a special snowflake they are.\nSo these are the two predictors of a dog’s behavior — their breed, or mix of breeds as best you can guess, as an indicator of a genetic predisposition to behave one way or another, and the second is their specific personality. Both can tell us a lot about whether training can override an inherited tendency to find birds, herd livestock, or dig up the backyard.\nBut a third factor must be considered when asking if a dog can be reliably trained to do any one particular thing. That factor is you. How much time do you have to devote to the exercise in question?\nSpoiler: It’s not about the breed. But these pupsarepretty brainy.\nHow important is it to you? How good a trainer are you? The answers to these questions have to be balanced against who your dog is, what they want to do and how much they want to do it. Answering the questions honestly and objectively will go a long way to either getting the job done or avoiding frustration and failure.\nSpeaking of failure, there’s one more essential factor that absolutely has to be added into the mix. What happens if things don’t go according to plan? What if, in spite of extensive and expert training, your Italian Greyhound forgets herself and takes off after a rabbit?\nCompare the consequences of that happening if you’re in a small, fenceddog parkas opposed to what might happen if you’re walking next to a six-lane highway with cars going 75 miles an hour. Imagine that the odds your dog won’t listen are the same in each case — say, 5 percent. It’s the same dog, with the samepersonalityand the same amount of training, just different scenarios. The choice most of us would make, at least while walking beside a highway, is obvious, and it is solely and uniquely tied to the consequences of losing the bet.\nYou might not know if you'll lose until it's too late, but you do know that the probability of success is so low that it isn’t worth the risk, the time, and the effort to find out. Put that dog on a lease next to Route 66.\nOn the other hand, if you had a Border Collie off-leash in a huge expanse of open land,  genetics and training are on your side. It will be easier to train them to come when recalled, though it’s also true that the Border Collies can vary tremendously in how easy they are to teach a 100 percent reliable recall. But the odds are more in your favor than the loose Greyhound in rabbit country.\nSo, the basic answer is “it depends.” But with careful consideration of your dog’s genetics, their personality, your level of training and commitment, and the consequence of failure, you’ll have an answer that will serve you well.",

    "page_content": "After her Labrador Retriever died, Jenny Collins, who lives in Portland, Oregon, was devastated. Knowing she wasn’t ready to bring another dog into her life, she decided to volunteer with dogs as a way to help fill the void. She quickly found the perfect match:Guide Dogs for the Blind (GDB), a nonprofit organization created in 1942 to breed, train, and pair service dogs with visually impaired people to help them achieve greater safety, mobility, and independence.\nProvided free of charge to the client, each dog represents a $100,000 investment over their lifetime, a cost that is funded 100% by private donations. GDB provides all services free of charge to their clients, including the cost of transportation and room and board while they undertake two weeks of training with their new guide dogs, annual visits, an alumni association, and veterinary care. If issues arise, the organization provides an instructor or field manager to help resolve them.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nThe transformation of GDB’s carefully bred puppies — Labrador Retrievers, Goldens, and Lab/Golden mixes — into reliable service dogs depends heavily on the raisers who start each new puppy on their long path toward training and graduation as a service dog.\nHow GDB Puppy Raising Begins\nStaff and volunteers help the canine moms raise their litters through the first eight weeks at the organization’s San Rafael, California campus. At two months old, the puppies are ready to go to individual homes. Most are transported to the various locations where volunteer raisers meet their puppies for the first time. After roughly a year in a home environment in which a clearly defined protocol is followed, the young dogs go into formal training at a GDB campus in California or Oregon.\nNot surprisingly, given the nature of the work, volunteers are thoroughly vetted by GDB, including a home visit to meet everyone involved and make sure the setting is pet-safe. “The puppies need consistency from their raisers,” Collins says. “So [the raisers] need to attend the training meetings, read all the documents, and watch the videos. It’s probably a 40-hour commitment before taking in your first puppy.”\nTypically, a new volunteer eases into the work by acting as a puppy sitter for dogs of varying ages and training stages. “We want to set people up for success,” Collins says, “to let them see what it’s like to have a puppy in their home before they commit to becoming a puppy raiser.”\nFrom puppy to partner, guide dogs are a special breed.\nFor Collins personally, it was two months before she was eligible to do anything hands-on with a puppy, and she recalls being frustrated because she was so eager to jump in. In retrospect, she understands why the more careful approach is necessary, and that raisers’ experience may vary, as many puppy sitters do hands-on work at meetings. Even now, Collins admits that she has questions and doubts about what she’s doing.\nIn some cases — like Collins’, because she works full-time — a puppy raiser partners with a puppy starter, who takes the two-month old for eight weeks and oversees most of their early basic training while finishing the vaccination schedule that started at the San Rafael campus. “I’m grateful beyond words for the puppy starter families because otherwise, I could not do this,” says Collins.\nThere are 180-plus GDB puppy raising clubs across 10 western states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Washington. Each of those states has at least one club, and new volunteers must join a club in order to become a puppy raiser. Puppy raisers are responsible for teaching the puppies good manners and providing socialization experiences for about the first year of the pups’ lives. They commit to attending twice-monthly meetings with the puppy for foundational training and support, and, once or twice each month, to taking the puppy on socialization outings to places where guide dogs might eventually work including malls, grocery stores, public transportation, and restaurants, which is Collins’ favorite part.\n“I volunteer to help coordinate outings since I love being a ‘social director,’” she says. She managed to get donated tickets to a minor-league baseball game so several puppy raisers and their pups could attend. Another time, she arranged a transit outing, creating a loop where the puppy raisers and their dogs rode an aerial tram, street car, light rail, and a bus.\nInside the Puppy Raising Experience\nThe first GDB puppy Collins raised was named Fizzy, and she came to Collins when she was four months old after spending time with a puppy starter family.\nCollins says that when she first joined her puppy raising club, she didn’t have any interest in sharing the task with a co-raiser. “I wanted to be independent in this, and so I was reluctant at first to share. But the more I learned about what was involved in raising one of these puppies, it became apparent that co-raising — for me and most people, and for the dog — is highly beneficial.”\nTo “co-parent,” Collins found a compatible family within her club. During Fizzy’s year-long training, she swapped homes every Tuesday. “I would take Fizzy to work with me on Monday and Tuesday, hand her off to the other family, and have the rest of the week and weekend off,” she explains. “The next week, no puppy on Monday and Tuesday, then Wednesday through Friday I’d bring her to work, have her over the weekend, take her to work the next Monday and Tuesday, and so on. It allowed me to schedule work obligations for when I didn’t have Fizzy. And it was like having a built-in puppy sitter if I was going out of town for a weekend. I did the same for my co-raiser family. It ended up working out pretty evenly over the year we had Fizzy.”\nCollins adds that raising a puppy is demanding, especially during the early weeks, when they’re high-energy and prone to chewing everything in reach. When Fizzy was with her at work, she was tethered in her workspace with a bed, bowl of water, and chew toys, but didn’t have access to the entire office. Puppies are gradually given freedom at home so that by the time they return to a GDB campus for formal training, they can be trusted alone in one or two rooms for up to an hour.\nToys, House Training, and Commands\nRaising a GDB puppy isn’t like raising a family pet. If they pass all their training successfully, these puppies will have great responsibilities. They need to be calm, ignore distractions, and remain focused on their human, keeping them safe from harm. They’re not allowed to play fetch — in fact, there are no balls in their toy box because as adults, they can’t be distracted by things that move fast in front of them. Instead, they burn off their energy with games of tug and sturdy chew toys.\nOne of the bigger challenges, Collins says, is house training, because accidents take pups out of the guide dog running. “We train them to relieve on command, on leash, and only on hard surfaces,” she explains, adding that she uses a patio in her backyard. “It’s a skill, building toward working as a guide dog. If we go on walks, they’re brief, and only after the dog has relieved at home beforehand. If they don’t, we won't go for the walk.”\nPuppy raisers use a specific command to teach a puppy that it’s time to go to the bathroom. They also take their guide-dog-in-training vest off, another signal that they’re not “working” and it’s okay to relieve themselves. Far more than a matter of convenience, this training ensures that, as adult working dogs matched with visually impaired humans, they won’t lose their focus because they’re searching for a place to go, or confuse their human by moving off the intended path to do their business.\nLook behind the advertising language when picking a dog trainer.\nIn addition to teaching appropriate relieving, volunteers help the pups learn basic commands such as “sit,” “down,” “stand,” “wait,” “stay,” “come,” “go to bed,” “let’s go,” and “that’s enough,” (meaning, we’re done playing).\nCollins says there’s no “leave it” command, which she initially found surprising, because her Lab Patience would scarf up all sorts of nasty things if she didn’t see them first. But as she discovered, that particular command isn’t required. Instead, the puppies are trained to completely ignore things on the ground by rewarding them with kibble when they do. They practice this skill until they’re reliable.\nIn the past, puppy raisers were not allowed to reward the puppies with food. It was important that as working dogs, they were not vulnerable to distraction. Over time, GDB’s training techniques have evolved to include making greater use of food as positive reinforcement. Now, puppies can be rewarded with a piece of kibble, but only the same kibble they eat at meals and only by hand from the person holding their leash.\nWhile raising a puppy, volunteers allow them a little bit of canine interaction, but most contact is with other GDB puppies during those twice-monthly club meetings, where they work on proper dog greetings (sniffing only). They don’t go to off-leash dog parks or greet strange dogs on the street. However, some puppy raisers and parents have other pet dogs in the home (or maybe even a retired guide dog), and in those situations, the puppies can play in controlled ways with the older dog.\n“We make sure the puppies have some exposure to other dogs,” Collins says, including occasionally trading puppies within the club so one who hasn’t spent time with a pet dog or cat gets the chance.\nWhen GDB Puppy Raising Doesn't Work Out\nWhen a GDB dog is found to be not well-suited as a working guide dog, GDB tries to match them with one of their partner organizations including Dogs for Better Lives, Dogs for Diabetics, and Paws Assisting Veterans. GDB also has an internal program for career-changed dogs known as K-9 Buddy, which partners dogs with visually impaired children and teenagers not yet ready for the responsibility of caring for a dog themselves.\nIf none of these programs are a good fit, the dog’s puppy raiser is given the option to adopt. If they choose not to, GDB has an adoption program that places the dogs in loving families looking for potential therapy dogs or amazing pets. GDB receives more than 2,000 applications for the roughly 170 dogs who are career-changed each year. If for any reason a pet parent or client can no longer care for a GDB dog, the organization takes the dog back and finds another home. Ultimately, each GDB dog is guaranteed a good home for a lifetime.\nThe Rewards Of Saying Goodbye to a GDB Puppy\nGDB knows how difficult it can be for puppy raisers to say goodbye to their dogs, so they try to make it easier with an event called a Recall Reception. For Fizzy, Collins met her co-raisers at the facility and together, they checked Fizzy in, settled her in her kennel, and talked to the employees who would care for her.\n“It was hard to leave,” Collins remembers. “Walking away, I felt like we were abandoning her. It’s crazy to feel that way. It’s not my decision, it’s what I signed up for.” The facility provides puppy raisers with weekly updates through all eight phases of their dog’s training.\nAfter training, puppy raisers are given an opportunity to meet the client matched with the dog they helped raise. “GDB will give the client your contact info,” Collins says. “The client gets to decide whether to stay in touch or not, so you might never hear.” Dogs can be placed anywhere in the U.S. or Canada, which makes the chance that puppy raisers will randomly see the puppies they raised very slim.\nAs Collins currently co-raises Fan, she’s realistic about what lies ahead. “I’m not an overly emotional person. Well, except for dogs,” she says, laughing. “I keep telling myself — assuming Fizzy makes it and becomes a guide dog — that this temporary time of sadness and loss is so worth her changing someone’s life. We live in a tough, often negative world, and this is something positive, a gift to a complete stranger. It’s rewarding, but the end goal has nothing to do with me. It benefits someone I’ve never met. How many times in life do you get a chance to give a gift like that? The reward is in making a positive change in a life. Even if Fizzy doesn’t become a guide dog, she’s already changed my life. Now, I hope she’ll change someone else’s.”\nWatchThe Pick of the Litter, a documentary that follows five puppies through the 18-month process of raising, formal training, and graduation, and visitGuide Dogs for the Blind.",

    "page_content": "Try crawling down a flight of stairs on all fours, and the experience may give you instant insight into why so many dogs hesitate about going down. Having your head aimed down at such a steep angle takes some getting used to. There are dogs who struggle to go up and down the stairs, but it is far more common for dogs or puppies who lack experience with them to be especially resistant to going down.\nLuckily, most dogs respond well if they are taught how to negotiate stairs in an (appropriately named) step-by-step process. The key is to teach dogs how to go down one or two steps at a time, avoiding having those steps be the ones at the top of a full flight of stairs, where the view seems a bit scary to most dogs.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nTrain Your Dog Down Stairs\nIdeally, begin by working with a dog in a place that has just a single step, if one is available to you. Typically, dogs are comfortable taking a single step down onto a long stretch of level ground. Using a smelly delicious food treat, you can lure a dog up the step, and immediately lure them back down. Do this several times in multiple short sessions until the dog is going up and down the step without any hesitation.\nThe next phase of training involves having the dog go down a few steps at a time. If you have a place with only 2-4 steps, that is ideal, but if not, you can use the bottom few steps of a flight of stairs. It’s easier with small dogs who you can lift up to the step and then lure down, but with bigger dogs, you can lure up and down if the dog is able to turn around on the step.\nIs your home a danger zone for a new dog? Follow these pro tips.\nOnce the dog is comfortable with several stairs (depending on your options, this may be 3 to 7 stairs at one time), expand the number of steps until the dog can go down an entire flight of stairs on his own.\nAs with any training, don’t force the dog. Work slowly within the dog’s physical and emotional comfort zone to avoid falls. Be patient, only progressing to a harder task when the dog is clearly comfortable with the current one.\nTips For Small Dogs\nIf you have a small dog, you make need to make some adjustments. In step one, you can lift them up and then lure them down the step, enticing them to step down by having them follow the treat. I prefer to lure both up and down, so the dog feels more in control of the situation.\nTips For Big Dogs\nIf the dog is too big to do point two comfortably and safely, then either try to find a place with just a few steps, or work at the top of the steps, but hold a blanket or pillow toblock the viewof the full flight of stairs and lure down two to four steps at a time and then move the visual blocker and do the next few steps.\nSometimes just standing below the dog on the steps is enough to block the view or reassure the dog and give them the confidence to descend one step at a time. If you have stairs with a landing in the middle, consider yourself lucky because you can do half as many steps and get the dog down on solid flat ground. That makes for a nice intermediate stage.",

    },
    "page_content": "Who doesn’t love taking photos of their dog? Dogs are beautiful, charming, and endearing. While this is true year-round, during the winter, it’s especially appropriate, when many of us are doing our best to inject any kind of fun we can into the holidays. To take a cute picture of your pup, it certainly helps to have a very patient dog with agood sit-stay, but even then, getting a good photo can still be a challenge. Read on for ways to get your pup to cooperate for photos.\nTrain Your Dog to Pose for Photos\nThe difference between a reasonably cute photo and a must-be-framed-and-hung-on-the-wall shot comes down to two basic issues: technical and behavioral. On the technical side, go for lighting andbackgroundsthat work in your favor. A proper understanding of your equipment means you can ensure that focus and exposure are spot on. The right perspective can make a huge difference; for example, capturing your dog at roughly their eye level will generally give you a better photo than a shot taken from above. Behaviorally, understanding how dogs naturally respond to a variety of cues goes a long way toward getting a photograph that does justice to your dog’s good looks. Here are a few things to keep in mind when getting your dog to model for pictures.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nFor a dog, a camera is a scary, giant eye. Dogs find staring rude as well as threatening, and a camera looks like the biggest eye ever to them. Because a larger lens used at a distance is less scary to most pups than a smaller lens used close up, a portrait lens is a good investment and will help ensure your pup looks in the right direction. And speaking of eyes, that’s where you literally need to keep your focus. A blurred tail or windblown fur can convey the essence of your dog by capturing their energy, but their eyes must be sharp, or the photo will look off.\nMy pro tips for taking grid-worthy (and life-saving) portraits of your pooch.\nThere’s somethingadorableabout a dog who’s cocking their head. Noises are key to drawing out that sought-after head-tilt. The easiest way to get your dog to tilt their head is to make an unfamiliar (and nonthreatening) sound. Why? Because of their extremely sensitive hearing, dogs often change the position of their ears to optimize their sound perception.\nSmooching, tongue clicks, saying “woop, woop,” or even singing or imitating a bird may cause your dog to look at you inquisitively—and voilà, there’s the cute head tilt. If that doesn’t work, try a squeaky toy. Some dogs will hold the tilt for a while, but many do so only briefly, so be ready to take the shot as soon as they move their head.\nFor most dogs, training is best described as a work in progress, but there’s no need to despair. In terms of photographs, the goal is mainly to keep your dog in a pose and get their attention. Even if your dog doesn’t necessarily or consistently follow cues, there are ways to achieve them for a photo.\nUse motion to your advantage:Many dogs are riveted by motion, so wiggling a finger, waving an arm or shaking a toy will often keep a dog occupied, posed and looking in the right direction long enough to take the shot.\nYour body language can help:Dogs who don’t have a solid stay can be encouraged to remain in place with a slight lean-forward by the photographer. Additionally, if you ask your dog to sit and then put some distance between you to get in position, back away instead of turning your back. Dogs have atendency to followwhen you turn away from them—a great thing in general, but not during a photo session.\nMake it a positive experience:Keep the session short and feed lots of treats and/or incorporate play. You don't want your pup to hate getting their picture taken. Do they love tofetch? Use a tennis ball or incorporate it into your photo. Are they drawn to a particular toy? Use it.\nThe worldneedscute pet pics. Here are five tips to help you go from amateur to Annie Leibovitz.\nNo matter how hard we try to take that elusive perfect photograph of our dogs, sometimes the best shots are the bloopers. Even during awkward moments, say when they're ignoring you and busily chewing one of the many treats. Do they tend to let their tongue hang out, or habitually raise their paw? Catch those moments and you will see not just a beautiful dog, butyourbeautiful dog. The result could be one of your all-time favorite dog photos.",

    },
    "page_content": "Since the pandemic lockdown, many aspects of our lives have switched over to online Zoom meetings and YouTube tutorials. Dog training has had a leg-up, because even pre-social distancing, trainers were starting to understand the upsides to online classes and some of them are great video editors. Professionaldog trainersprovide information with flashy graphics about how to teach loose-leash walking, stop unwantedbarking, and coming when called.\nBut it’s not a perfect solution, since any amateur can set up tripods in their living rooms and film how their dog learned sit, down, stay, and otherobedience basics. These can be very fun to watch as you eat popcorn and your dog runs wildly around the house, but they most likely don’t provide the long-term benefits of focused, personalized instruction.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nWith the improvement in interactive online dog training classes, however, they might be a great supplemental option in times when you are very busy, or there is a worldwide health crisis. Many trainers now offer step-by-step instructional videos within their own websites or via a private Facebook group. Those groups also make it easier for participants to build community and share tips with each other. Here’s what you need to know if you’re considering an online dog training course.\nWhat are the benefits of online training?\nOne benefit of online dog training is flexible timing and lower cost. There are usually students with a full-service spot in the in-person classroom who want feedback from their instructor and classmates. They’ll often record homework videos, then upload them to the cyber classroom. Another person can choose a less-expensive auditing spot, observe the course online, and possibly ask questions, but they can’t post video for feedback.\nPlus, it can be less distracting to watch a video while your dog is taking a nap and then work with them later, as opposed to managing your dog in a room full of dogs in front of an instructor with limited time.\nProfessional dog trainers, behaviorists, dog-sports competitors, and curious dog lovers can also further educate themselves via online lectures and single-topic webinars. Typically, the former address general dog behavior, learning theory, and applied science, while the latter focus on how to solve a specific behavior problem or refine a training skill.\nSubscription or membership-based services are another option. In this arrangement, a trainer’s entire online library of lectures, videos, courses, and more is available 24/7 for either a monthly or a yearly fee. This can be cheaper than taking classes or webinars one-by-one if you prefer a more general overview.\nOne of the most specific dog sports are where the true explosion in online dog training can be found. In-person seminars can be costly, and tough to get into if the instructor is in high demand. Online learning is less expensive, more convenient, and allows for more participants.\nLike most things in 2023, there’s a Zoom link for this.\nWhat are the downsides to online classes?\nMaking your own dog training content is not for everyone. Barb Krynski of Rolling Meadows, Illinois, can’t justify the time to set up a camera and film her sessions, especially if she’s training alone. “I’m not motivated enough to do the exercises by myself,” she says. “I enjoy actual classes and workshops more.”\nKristen Nelson of Anchorage, Alaska, was disappointed with one of her online courses, even though the instructor had a solid reputation and offered a wealth of material.\n“Student support was close to nil,” says Nelson. Despite paying more than $1,000 for the course, she waited three weeks for the instructor to respond to her question. Classmates had offered feedback, but she thought at that price, she should hear from the instructor directly.\nUnfortunately, instruction or the quality of material can be hit-or-miss, as Claire Putman of Sycamore, Illinois, found. “I had several that were somewhat disappointing. The instructors seemed a bit unsure as to flow and content. I learned toward the end of class that they were using the current class to obtain feedback and information to then refine the class to offer later. I was not happy that I paid full price to be used for their information-gathering and perfecting process.”\nHow to find the best online dog trainer.\nIf you’re still intrigued by online dog training courses, despite the potential downsides, here’s how to find the best program. It’s important to ask questions and seek recommendations. Make sure the course structure, materials, and method of instruction fit your needs. For example, is the class size-limited? What’s the time frame: Is the course six weeks long like a traditional in-person training class, or longer? Will the instructor provide direct feedback to each student, or is it self-study with only classmates commenting on each other’s work? Some instructors include online coaching calls to the group, or one-on-one consultations for an additional fee.\nAre you required to have specific equipment and/or a certain amount of space? Will you be able to complete the assignments in a timely manner? Will the instructor give you a grace period if you fall behind? Many online students complain about homework catch-up. Work or family responsibilities can take a toll on an online training schedule. Also, if a person or dog is injured, will you get your money back or have an opportunity to take the class at a later date?\nAnd it never hurts to read reviews!\nHow to get the very most out of your online classes.\nLike most things, what you get out of online dog training courses can depend on how much you put into them. First, make sure you read the content and watch the related videos before training your dog.\nConsider having a family member watch you work with the dog and have them offer you suggestions for doing it just as demonstrated on the video. Make sure your dog is having fun, using their favorite treats and toys for active encouragement, but keep sessions of training short — 5 to 7 minutes is a good guideline for working on a skill. Consider if there’s a time of the day where they generally have more energy and focus. And don’t forget to practice training both on leash and off leash so your dog understands she should pay attention in both situations.\nThe questions to ask and credentials to look out for to find the right trainer foryourdog, according to a pro.\nIf you live in a bigger household, make training a family activity so everyone learns how to train the dog. In addition to planned training sessions, incorporate training into daily life. For example, ask your dog to wait at the door before going out on walks; have them sit before feeding or lie down before initiating a tug game.\nStay on a lesson for multiple days or weeks if your dog is still catching on, or go ahead if your dog has already mastered the curriculum for a particular week. That is definitely a nice thing about videos. They wait.\nOnline dog training might not be for you.\nSome people are sick of being online for everything, which is very fair. For those with little to no background in dog training, the in-person option might be the best fit. The instructor can answer your questions immediately, demonstrate training with your dog, and give instant feedback on your mechanics. It’s also helpful to observe fellow classmates work with their dogs on the same exercises and see different ways of achieving the same goal.\nIt can also be a nice way to make new friends that the computer just can’t replace. Many students who start a class together then graduate to the next level and became lifelong friends. Making real friends in class and seeing your dog socialize with her buddies are priceless and lead to treasured lifetime memories.\nSo, what’s the verdict — online or in-person? Like so many things in life, the answer is, it depends. An honest evaluation of your level of expertise, available time, tech skills and learning style will help you decide. The good news is that help is available in both the analog and the digital worlds.",

      "title": "Are There Differences Between Guide Dog Breeds?",
      "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/guide-dog-breeds"
    },
    "page_content": "Does the breed of a service dog make a difference? When so many intelligent, loving shelter dogs are in need of homes, why don’t guide dog schools rescue dogs like some of the other service-dog programs (likeAnimal Farm Foundation)? The answer lies in the nature of the work guide dogs are required to do. Dog jobs, like people jobs, are task-specific and require specific temperaments, some of which can be selected through breeding.\nRead on to hear the real-life experiences of seven blind people who’ve used guide dogs most of their lives. They compare problem-solving strategies between 36 dogs representing six breeds. If you’ve lived with a Lab, Golden, German Shepherd, Aussie, Border Collie, Flat Coat, Poodle or hybrid of these breeds, you’ll probably be pretty fascinated by how each breed handles the job.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nWhat type of dogs are guide dogs?\nTerry Barrett, director of training operations at Guide Dogs for the Blind (GDB) in San Rafael, Calif., says, “In our earliest days, the 1940s, most of our dogs came from animal shelters. It soon became evident that we were looking for something very specific: Dogs who not only had excellent health, intelligence and temperament but also exhibited a willingness to work and thrived on praise.” By the late 1970s, opportunities for shelter dogs all but disappeared.\nAlthough German Shepherds, Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers are the most familiar types of guide dog, any confident, friendly, intelligent and willing dog —large enough for the harness but small enough to lie comfortably under a bus seat — is eligible. Boxers, Smooth-Coated Collies, Poodles, Dobermans, Border Collies and Australian Shepherds are increasingly finding employment as guide dogs, as are their more genetically sound hybrid offspring.\nLoyal, devoted, and dutiful, Pit Bulls are proving to be pretty well suited to helping humans in need.\nLabs are the most common guide dog breed.\nLabrador Retrievers, who constitute about 60 percent of these working dogs, have proven to be the most successful guide worldwide, mainly because there is enough variation within the breed to meet blind students’ myriad needs. “It’s a 50-50 relationship,” says a handler who’s worked with one Lab, two mixed-breed Labs and two Goldens, and now is partnered with aLabradoodle. “Neither one of us is in total control at any given time. Both of our lives depend on what the other one does. Neither of us may be able to make a safe street crossing alone, but together we do it gracefully.”\nGuide dog schools select for temperament characteristics that are broadly adaptable. A guide dog’s disposition requires them to be easily trainable, friendly, calm under pressure, and confident in their job — in all environments. Regardless of lineage, guide dogs have distinct counterintuitive characteristics in common. Because they are, to a great extent, bred for a specific temperament, they are more like one another than they are like others of their particular breed.\nIs there a best guide dog breed?\nBoth the person and dog work as a team, each contributing to a relationship built on trust that begins during class, then deepens and broadens over time. But some blind handlers argue that there are marked differences in each breed’s approach to guide work, while others think that the traits that make good guides neutralize the larger behaviors that characterize each breed.\nOne blind handler who has worked with a German Shepherd for 10 years, a Lab for seven, two different Golden Retrievers for 15 years, and now has two years experience under his belt working with a Golden-Lab cross says that there are some physical characteristics that are different among breeds, such as the gait and how the dog feels through the harness. “Even so, the dog’s unique personality, combined with the person’s — how they work together and what they expect of each other — that’s where the differences are.”\nAnother woman who has worked with two Shepherd guides and one Lab-Golden cross said, “In my opinion, you might say that the retrievers’ style provides more information about the specifics of the environment, but the Shepherds’ style makes for more efficient travel. My Shepherds, in comparison to my Retriever, both typically looked farther ahead as they guided. They corrected for upcoming obstacles from a distance and our travel path was typically a smooth line. Sudden turns or stops happened only in response to an obstacle that unexpectedly crossed our intended path. My retriever cross clearly does not take the same approach. In general, this dog will stop and show me the obstacle, and he will almost always seek prompting from me on which way to go next.”\nOne woman got her first German Shepherd in 1996 after working with three Labs. She says she had to learn the body language that was unique to the Shepherd. “At first, I thought when my Shepherd would insist on going a certain way and I wanted to go another that she was being stubborn or willful. I soon discovered that if I acknowledged her for what she was showing me, and then asked her to go the direction I wanted to go, she was totally fine with that. My second Shepherd is the same way.”\n“How my dogs dealt with obstacles isn’t, in my opinion, a function of breed-specific differences,” says a seasoned 25-year guide dog user who has partnered with an Airedale, a Border Collie mix, an Australian Shepherd and, briefly, a Siberian Husky. “My Airedale, as I recall him, was quick to generalize about the concept “obstacle” but wasn’t particularly good at scoping out his environment and making decisions in advance.” The Aussie and the Border Collie mix seemed to generalize quickly.\n“The Border Collie mix had very high head carriage and was by far the very best dog I’ve worked when it came to overhead hazards,” he said. “The Aussie has been harder to teach naturally occurring overheads like tree limbs, but whether that’s a breed thing or a result of their tendency to work with their heads a little low, I’m not sure.”\nSay What? A look at the types of words that dogs understand.\nAnother typical difference between dogs, explains a blind handler, is their approach to routes. “Personally, I find that my retrievers enjoyed familiar routes. In comparison, my Shepherd gets bored with routine, so you have to get creative with routes and mix things up,” she says.\nShe adds that retrievers are looking to please the handler, as if asking, “Did I do what you wanted, am I making you happy?” whereas her shepherds have been motivated by doing the job and solving the problems. “With Shepherds, it’s not so much about what pleases me as it is about pleasing themselves,” she says.\nA guide dog handler who has worked with three Labs, a Lab mix, a Golden Retriever and a German Shepherd explained, “If I were to generalize,” she says, “I’d say my Labs often worked up to an obstacle before deciding what to do about it, while my Shepherd would decide in advance what to do, perhaps starting the turn more gradually as we approached the barrier. My Golden would stop to show me before trying to work it out.”\n“My Goldens were much more attuned to my reactions to things. If I did hit a branch, I needed only to flinch and they both acted as if they had been corrected. I would describe my Lab as being solid, but she had the attitude that things would move for her or she would move them. She was careful, generally, but also had no compunction about moving me through some tight gaps. It wasn’t always pretty, but she would get you where you needed to go safely and with enthusiasm.”\n“Working a guide dog is like dancing,” she explains. “And being responsive to my partner’s moves is how it works best for me. I’ve had two very large Labs, both with a lot of initiative. They seldom asked for my input, made quick swift movements and expected I would be able to keep up and go with them. They were more likely to try to interpose their bodies between me and muscle me out of the way or into safety. My Golden and my small Lab were likely to be cautious and refuse to leave the curb until they determined that a car they watched was not going to move toward us.”\nEight guide dogs and 34 years later, a handler contemplated her experiences with four Labs, two Goldens, one Shepherd, and one Flat-coat Retriever. “My Flat Coat solved problems by coming to a full stop. Sometimes he would just stand there, and I could feel his head moving. People said that he looked like he was weighing all the possibilities. Then he would make his decision. And in nine years of partnership, he never made a mistake.”\nRegardless of genealogy, each dog takes a unique approach to problem-solving. “I noticed that the Aussie I’m working with now had a very strong preference for traveling on one or another side of a street when we walked home from work,” explained his handler. “Eventually, I figured out the preference stemmed from whether it was or had recently been raining. One side of the street was commercial, the other had lots of trees with branches that hung low when wet.”\nFind out which dog breed is right for your lifestyle.\nA blind woman who has traveled with guides said, “My assumption is that my dog is acting to keep us safe until he proves to be distracted or is putting his agenda ahead of mine. Sure, if that sudden plunge proves to be because my Lab dove for a French fry, the appropriate correction needs to be made. Extra work to minimize that behavior may be called for, but ‘follow your dog’ has to be the first response if we are going to learn to trust and read each other. My safety depends on my ability to read their reactions and go with it and figure out the ‘whys’ later.”\nOne man described all his dogs as having been keen observers. “They’ve all had similar complex personalities,” he says. “They enjoyed their work and have been more than willing to guide and do things such as squeeze into small spaces and stay for hours, only because I have asked them to.”\nA thirty-year guide dog veteran summed it up. “I’ve owned plenty of dogs as pets, but my relationship with the half dozen guide dogs I’ve worked with was different: All of my guide dogs seemed to own me rather than the other way around.”",

It’s important to “mark” the points described below so your dog understands exactly which actions to repeat.\nAccording to animal behaviorist Karen London, using a more specific terms like“biddable”or“bombproof” can help you better understand your dog.\nHere’s how to start:\nFirst, start by having your dog sit in front of you, facing you in the “sit front” position. To focus their attention, hold both hands in front of you, with a treat in the left hand.\nYou’ll say their name and the cue “flip” while stepping back with your left foot, luring your dog away and behind you with your left hand. Mark with a “yes” and reward once they pass you.\nQuickly step and lure your pup forward into heel position while raising your hand above her head and saying “sit” once they’re at your side. Mark with a “yes” and reward again.\nTo further practice, keep them in a sit and pivot around to face them so they are toe to toe in the “sit” position in front of you.\nAs you and your dog because more fluid in your movements together, gradually fade the steps and luring until they can flip from a sit front into heel position while you stand still.",

    },
    "page_content": "If your dog has already mastered a slew ofbasic trickslike crawl, spin, and rollover, and you’re looking for something new to teach your pup, look no further. Teaching your dog to back up — to move away from you by taking steps backward — is a great choice. But it’s more than just a cute party trick; teaching your pup to back away from you is actually a prettyuseful trick.\nEven if your dog has a solid stay and wait, teaching your dog to back up will come in handy in many situations. Dogs can sometimes get in the way or literally underfoot, and asking them to “back up” solves the problem. You might beopening the front door, the pantry, or the fridge, and your dog is crowding the space. Or asking your dog to back away from a trash can, the dishwasher, another dog’s food bowl, or a toy.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThe “back up” command also works while on walks to deter them from anythingfound on a streetthat looks gross or dangerous. While it’s true that the cue “leave it” will also work in those contexts — having a dog create physical distance between themselves and the forbidden object sometimes helps them resist temptation. “Leave it” only tells most dogs that they may not grab something, but it gives them no help deciding what to do instead. The cue to “back up” instructs them with a specific incompatible behavior to perform. (A dog cannot simultaneously approach the dishes in the dishwasher and back away from them.)\nGo beyond the basics.\nWhether you ask them to back out of a crowded kitchen, to get out of your way as you carry a load of laundry, or to back away from an intersection withskateboardersflying by — there’s no limit to how you can use this important cue.\nTeach Your Dog to Back Up\nIn addition to its great practicality, the “back up” cue is relatively easy to teach. Here’s how:\nStart with your dog standing in front of and paying attention to you. Move toward your dog calmly.\nWhen they take a step backward, reinforce immediately with a click/treat or atreat. For some dogs, a couple of steps in their direction work best but for other dogs, a slight lean is most effective.\nReinforce your dog for taking a step backward until they do it reliably. Then, move toward your dog until they have taken more than one step backward. Reward them for taking multiple steps.\nOnce your pup understands that backing up is a way to earn treats, say the cue “back up” before moving toward them, and reinforce them for responding appropriately.\nWith practice, you can phase out the motion toward your pup so that they are backing up in response to the cue alone. You can use a visual cue, such as extending your arm towards them instead of the verbal cue or in addition to it.\nChoosing Your Verbal Cue\nWhile I use the verbal cue “back up” for this behavior, you may use any verbal cue as long as it is consistent and easy to remember. A few common cues for this same behavior are “back out,”  “get back,” and “beep beep.” Any of these words will work equally well. Choose the one you like best, but keep in mind that it’s best to avoid using a command that sounds similar to any cues your dog already knows for any other behaviors.\nCommon Training Hiccups\nSome dogs will respond to your motion towards them by sitting down or by turning around. If your dog is a sitter during this training, try holding a treat a few inches over their head and slowly moving it towards their back end. This causes most dogs to step back rather than sit, and you can then reinforce the behavior.\nIf your dog’s tendency is to turn, try to train them in a narrow hallway or between two large pieces of furniture so that there’s not enough room for them to turn around. Presented with such an obstacle, most dogs will try to back up as an alternative, providing you with an opportunity to reinforce the behavior you are looking for.",

    "page_content": "When it comes to dog mushing, you probably think of a team of sturdy, excited dogs pulling sleds hundreds of miles along snowy, Alaskan trails. But, turns out, you don't need a team of Huskies — or even snow — to try mushing. Enter: dryland (or urban) mushing, a sport that's gaining in popularity in which your dog pulls you on dry land, instead of ice or snow. It's a great way to keep you and your pup in shape — and it's easier to try than you might think. Here's how.\nWhat is Dryland Mushing?\nAlso known as urban mushing, dryland mushing refers to non-snow, dog-powered activities that involve one to two dogs, a human, and minimal equipment. The most popular type of dryland mushing is canicross (canine + cross country), where you attach your dog to your waist with a bungee leash and let them pull you forward as you run. Canicross is a great way tobond with your dogwhile increasing your speed, stride and endurance.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nSome other popular forms of dryland mushing are bikejoring (your dog pulls you on yourbike), skatejoring (your dog pulls you on yourskateboardor rollerblades), and carting (your dog pulls a loaded cart for a specific distance).\nHow to Try Dryland Mushing\nThe best way to get started is with canicross. Any breed can take part in canicross — all you need is a dog who’s healthy and loves to run. (Puppies, dogs with prior injuries, or older dogs with arthritis should not take part in dryland mushing.) Here's how to try canicross:\nIf your dog hasn’t been particularly active, get them in shape first. Begin by walking and progress to running as their endurance improves. As with any new activity, check with your veterinarian before starting.\nFor canicross, you’ll need: a properly fitted and padded pulling harness; a padded belt for you; and a gangline, which connects you to your dog. Harnesses can be found online (search for “canicross equipment”). Just be sure to read measuring guidelines closely to ensure a proper fit. Dogs rarely stand still for long, so measure your dog several times to get a reliable average.\nThe harness must distribute the pulling weight along your dog’s shoulders while avoiding their shoulder joints, belly, and spine. Many people prefer a shorter, “buggy style” harness for dryland because it gives a better pull angle, but you can also use a traditional X-back sled harness. Freight- or weight-pulling harnesses do not work well, since they’re designed for a load that’s much closer to the ground than the average person’s waist. You can expect to pay between $25 and $50 for a good harness. For the human portion of the canicross setup, a commercial skijor system with a belt and gangline will run between $40 and $70, and is often sold as a kit.\nGet your fix of Kinship\nWe promise not to send you garbage that turns your inbox into a litter box.

Make sure it’s comfortable, keeps you safely connected to your dog, and has some sort of shock absorber (such as an interwoven bungee) between you and your dog to prevent injuries. The line should be long enough to keep the angle as low to the ground as possible, yet not be an obstacle to other trail users. Most skijor lines have about eight to 10 feet of quality polypropylene rope between the waist belt and the dog’s harness. This allows the harness to properly distribute the load and the dog to have more forward power.\nInitially, some dogs are more willing to pull than others. The most important thing to remember when getting started is to give your dog a fun and positive experience so they end their training sessions craving more.\nIf you’ve worked hard to train your dognotto pull, don't worry: You can maintain your dog’s leash-friendly behavior by conditioning them to know that wearing a harness means it’s OK to pull. Be consistent: If your dog is wearing the harness, they need to be pulling something. Start off with something small — a little log, a milk jug filled with water, a small wheelbarrow tire. Go on your normal walk, but put the harness on your dog and have them drag the object. Once they're used to having weight and movement behind them, you can gradually increase the load to about 25 percent of their body weight.\nAs your dog becomes comfortable with pulling weight, start positioning yourself behind them while they're pulling to get them used to the idea that you will be behind rather than next to them.\nNext, you can introduce some commands. Traditionally, “gee” means turn right, “haw” means turn left, “whoa” means stop, and a cheerful “hike” means “Let’s go.” However, you can use any set of terms you want as long as you use them consistently and they are distinct enough to not be confusing for your dog.\nAlways say the turn commands as you are making the turn. If your dog starts down the wrong direction, stop, give a verbal correction (I use “Ah!”) and repeat the turn command. The moment your dog looks down the correct trail, give a happy “Good dog!” and start moving. Be patient and make sure you don’t give an incorrect direction. Your dog will naturally learn that the correct direction means the walk continues.\nAnother important command is “on by,” which means “Continue straight through that intersection or past that distraction” (think:squirrels, other dogs, kids). While your dog is working, you want them to continue down the trail and not stop to visit along the way. Be sure to give your dog lots of praise at the end of each session.\nOnce you and your dog are working as a team, start increasing your speed and distance. Try new trails. Add some challenge by going to an area with lots of turn choices — when it comes to a good team-building experience, mental workouts are just as important as physical ones.",

    "page_content": "Visualize this scenario: Comet, a six-month-old Labrador in a beginner-level dog training class, ignores all distractions and charges back to her person, Olivia, after hearing “Comet, come!” As soon as she arrives, Comet receives effusive praise and petting from Olivia. A great example ofpositive reinforcement, right? Except that, in this very common situation, Comet responds to the actions of her pet parent by turning her head away as though in disgust.\nWhat is Positive Punishment?\nPositive punishment in dog training is when you give an unwanted“reward”(like an overly enthusiastic pat) after a dog does what you asked, which may make the dog less likely to do that behavior again.Olivia’s actions were a perfect example of positive punishment. Olivia couldn’t have done a better job of teaching Comet to ignore her if she had tried.\nTrick question: All dogs are perfect! But find out which type is the best fit for you.\nBut wait —don’t dogs love to be petted? Don’t they love to be praised? Well, yes, they do. But then, no, they don’t. Lest you think I’m messing with your mind, put yourself in your dog’s position for a moment. Ah, yes, I know — beinganthropomorphiccan cause a lot of problems, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t useful sometimes.\nBear with me here: Imagine that you’ve just done something wonderful, and your boss wants to thank you. She gives you a box of expensive chocolates, the kind infused with exotic flavors, like lavender and chili. You know she spent a fortune on them. Except, you don’t like lavender-chili chocolate; you like good old-fashioned milk chocolate from Hershey, Pa. Or, maybe you love flavored chocolate, but you’re on a diet, and being presented with a pound of chocolates is akin to torture.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nThe dog in the training class and you as an employee are in the same position: Someone is trying to give you “positive reinforcement” for a behavior they’d like you to repeat, but what they’re giving you is something they define as good and you define as, well, not very. Dogs may love petting, butnot all versionsof it, and not in every context. Praise may be music to their ears, but not all the time, or maybe they like funk and you’re singing jazz.\nAvoiding Positive Punishment\nMany people know that using positive reinforcement in dog training is the most effective way to influence behavior, but knowing how to use it effectively takes more than remembering to carry cookies in your pocket. Without a doubt, one of the most common problems people have when using positive reinforcement is not being thoughtful enough about what their dog defines as positive. Of course, small bits of tasty food are fundamental for training a dog who truly loves to do what you ask, but they are not enough.\nYou’re not always going to have treats in your pocket, and your dog isn’t always going to be hungry (well, that’s true for some of our dogs, anyway). When you do usetreats, keep in mind that the most frequent mistake beginners make is to use bland, boring stuff akin to a solitary oyster cracker. Good enough if you’re really hungry, but not worth leaving a plate of linguini with braised spinach and caramelized tomatoes for — or, if you’re a dog, a greasy food wrapper in the gutter.\nBut food, even great food, is never enough. The last thing you want is a dog who listens to you if you have edibles in your pocket and ignores you the rest of the time. And, although it’s hard to imagine if your own pup is a furry garbage disposal, there really are dogs who just don’t care all that much about food.\nThat brings us to petting and praise, which can also be great reinforcements if the dog truly likes to be petted (pats on top of the head appear to be as aversive to dogs as they are to people) and if it’s given at a time when a dog really wants it. Otherwise, an eight-month-old Lab/Husky cross is probably going to see pats on the head as positive punishment. He doesn’t want to be petted when he’s in the middle of play any more than you want to have your back rubbed during an important business meeting. Thus, food, petting and praise are great reinforcers if and only if they’re something your dog wants at the time they’re given, as opposed to something that makesyoufeel good for giving them.\nChoosing the Right Rewards\nBut there’s much more to positive reinforcement than dog treats, pets and praise. When avoiding positive punishment great trainers become truly creative, and is often the reason some dogs are phenomenally responsive.\nMy favorite story of creative reinforcement comes from Kinship writer and CAAB Dr. Karen B. London. She was out with her newly acquired Lab mix, Bugsy, when they flushed a deer. Shecalled the dog to comejust before he sprang off in pursuit, and to her joy and amazement, he turned and ran back to her. Alas, before their outing, she had switched jackets on the fly and inadvertently left her training treats at home. She couldn’t even take off running to let Bugsy chase her because she was wearing cross-country skis and facing the wrong way in the ski track. Ever the quick thinker, Karen reached into her pocket, took out a used tissue and gave it to Bugsy when he arrived. Voila! Her dog was thrilled at this acquisition, and Karen’s creative thinking laid a foundation for a solid recall for years to come.\nThe key to curbing mindless snacking — this is for your dog.\nHowever, there are many more ways to expand your repertoire — you just need to know what your dog loves. More creative examples positive reinforcements:\nLetting the dog have limited access to the very distraction they had been called away from (compost heap, dead bird, garbage bag).\nLetting the dog have limited access to the very distraction they had been called away from (compost heap, dead bird, garbage bag).\nUse “life rewards,” meaning the dog gets what they want as a matter of course during the day (say, going outside after waiting at the door).\nUse “life rewards,” meaning the dog gets what they want as a matter of course during the day (say, going outside after waiting at the door).\nUse a well-known cue as a reinforcer.

I love to sit!”\nEffective positive reinforcements include ice cubes, snowballs, bunny poop, cheering and clapping, pine cones, feathers, paper-towel tubes,digging, being allowed to sniff interesting things, running around the yard in crazy circles … and on and on. You can see that the list is almost endless — you’re constrained only by the number of things that make your dog happy and being mindful of your dog’s safety (e.g., you can sniff some things but not ingest them).\nOne smartagilitytrainer had a dog who, no matter what she tried, would not go around the last weave pole. Then she remembered that her dog loved to jump into the car, so she set up the poles leading toward the car and used jumping in as a reward for weaving around the last pole.\nAnother agility trainer taught afearful dogto enjoy the teeter board by usingscent markingas a reward. Turns out the dog loved to lift his leg and mark objects, so every time he took one step closer to walking across the teeter, he got to lift his leg on the fence! This is a perfect example of what psychologists call the “Premack principle,” which says that a more-probable behavior can be used to reinforce a less-probable behavior. In other words, if your dog loves to dig, there’s a high probability he’ll do it if he has the chance. If that’s true, you can use digging as a reinforcer, secure in the knowledge that he must love it if he does it so often. If there is a low probability he’ll come when called after he’s seen a squirrel, you can use digging to reinforce a recall in that context.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s pro tips for walking a pup that wantsto chase everything that moves.\nAnother positive reinforcement tool that’s always handy to have is putting a problem behavior on cue and then using it as a reinforcer. My absolute favorite example of this came from someone whose dog loved mouthy play. The guardian put it on cue by saying “Rabies!” Now, she not only has control over the behavior, she can use it as a reinforcement. Brilliant! I did something similar (although nowhere near as funny) with Lassie by teaching her to jump up on me when I said “Be bad!” Lassie had come to me at 11 months as one of the worst leapers I’d ever seen. She’d launch herself up to a visitor’s face and, suspended midair, put her tongue halfway down his throat (we called her the French-kissing queen). It took many months, but I eventually taught her to sit while greeting company by using food treats and putting jumping-up on cue. She still loved to leap toward faces, so it turned out to be a great way to thank her for doing what I had asked, including sitting politely for company.\nI’ll end on my current favorite example of creative thinking. One guardian had a scent-hound mix named Maggie who couldn’t be trusted off-leash. As happens to the best of us, the dog got out of the house one day and was just about to take off when the guardian spotted one of Maggie’s best friends close by. Nope, not another dog, but rather, a cat she loved to play with (a mutual pleasure, I’m happy to report). Our quick-thinking guardian grabbed the cat, held him up in the air and said “Maggie! Kitty!” and her dog came running. The three of them dashed into the house together, the dog and cat played joyfully, and the guardian breathed a sigh of relief. Now,thatis quick thinking! Granted, we can’t all grab a nearby cat, but I’ll bet there are at least five things your dog loves that you haven’t used yet.",
