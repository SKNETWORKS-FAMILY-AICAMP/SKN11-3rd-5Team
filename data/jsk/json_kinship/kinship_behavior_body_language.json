  "page_content": "Most dogs don’t love it when we leave them home alone. We get it; we don’t like to be away from them, either. It’s annoying to leave our best friends for mundane and unimportant things like jobs, errands, a social life. However, disliking watching their pet parents leave the house and actually panicking about it are two different things.\nA few simple things help most dogs become comfy: exercise, food-puzzle toys, and a comfortable spot to rest until we get back. Assisting dogs with separation anxiety is a serious challenge, but you and your pup can overcome it. First thing’s first: myth-busting. There are several pervasive myths about treating separation anxiety, and clearing them up makes it more likely that dogs will get the effective treatment they need and deserve to be happy and well.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nYou must confine your dog to a crate or small room when you are gone.\nIf your dog is chewing on anything and everything when you are gone, peeing, pooping, and droolingon your carpets, and generally making a giant mess of your house every time you leave, the idea of confining your dog is tempting (oh, so tempting!). However, doing this when you are gone does nothing to ease the panic they feel about being alone.\nAt best, all confinement does is keep the mess to a smaller area, while doing nothing to alleviate your dog’s fear of the situation. It may also teach your dog to beterrified of the cratethey used to be happy to settle down in when people are home. It can even lead to injuries for dogs who are desperate to escape the crate to try to find you.\nIt’s essential to leave your dog with a stuffed Kong or a similar food toy.\nShockingly, leaving your pup with astuffed Kongis far less effective when treating separation anxiety than using desensitization methods. In other words, you need toget your dog usedto all your “leaving” cues, such as putting on your shoes, picking up your keys, or touching the doorknob. That is much more effective than giving them special toys or treats when you leave them alone.\nGiving your dog a treat or toy they love as you leave just adds to the routine of you leaving and is one more signal to them that you’re heading out. Also, many dogs in this scenario are too upset to eat, and even those who do will sometimes finish the food and then panic when it is gone.\nGetting more exercise will fix it.\nExercise is generally helpful for dogs’ wellbeing, and I’m all for adding more of it to your dog’s daily life.Exercise is enjoyablefor dogs, it’s good for their health, and helps many dogs sleep better, which, in turn, makes them feel better. Exercise will enhance their life no matter what.\nWhat it willnotdo, though, is serve as a treatment for separation anxiety. Exercise ismagic up to a point(and necessary to keep your pup healthy), but it cannot cure anything and everything. Trying to fix separation anxiety by giving your dog more exercise is much like trying to cure yourself of a fear of heights or a fear of spiders by going running every day. It’s a beautiful idea, but it’s a myth rather than a real solution.\nOnly use medication if nothing else works.\nYour vet can help you decidewhether to use medicationto help treat your pup’s separation anxiety.  As a behaviorist and trainer, medication is out of my area of expertise, but I can share the basics.\nA benefit of using medication is that it makes dogs better able to learn. That means they respond more effectively and more quickly to efforts to teach them to handle being left alone. It’s not a last-resort strategy — it’s part of a multi-pronged approach for helping them cope with being left alone. If medication is appropriate for a dog, based on a veterinarian’s medical opinion, it can have a huge positive impact on the progress of the behavior modification. Consider consulting with your veterinarian about medication now as a part of your efforts to help your dog. Don’t wait until it feels like a last-ditch effort.\nOnly the dog’s pet parent can calm them down.\nThere is a common belief that a dog with separation anxiety will become upset and panicky if they are away from their pet parent. In most cases, dogs with separation anxiety are fine whensomeoneis there with them, even if it is not their person. They only become distressed if they are alone, rather than if they are away from their family.\nThat makes the logistics of treating separation anxiety easier because you don’t have to be with your dog constantly, though you do have to make sure someone is with your dog at all times. It’s still hard, but with a community of support, it can be done, and far more easily than if you had to be the one with your dog 24/7. Being with your dog every minute of every day sounds amazing in theory, but in practice, it’s hard on your lifestyle. We all need a little space sometimes, ya know?\nSeparation anxiety is your fault.\nIt’s easy to criticize and assume people are doing something wrong if their dog flips out when they’re alone. This is completely false. I suspect many people like to thinktheycould never end up with a dog with separation anxiety because this is only a problem for people who have made mistakes.False.\nBlaming people for their dog’s struggles is misplaced and unkind. Isn’t the world harsh enough without accusing people of causing problems that aren’t their fault? Any number of reasons — breed tendencies, instinct, a natural stress response, etc. — can cause this issue. It doesn’t mean pet parents did anything wrong.\nReferences\nDeMartini-Price, Malena.Separation Anxiety in Dogs: Next Generation Treatment Protocols for Fearing and Phobic Dogs.

    "title": "8 Signs Your Dog Is an Introvert",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/signs-your-dog-is-an-introvert"
  },
  "page_content": "Not all dogs are party animals. For example, my human partner is more of a golden retriever-type than my dog. Perhaps you, too, have found that your pet prefers solitude, is indifferent towards other dogs, or seems to understand the phrase “cancelled plans” on an emotional level. Especially when combined, these behaviors may have made you wonder: Is my dog an introvert?\nCreatures across the animal kingdom, includingchimpanzees and octopi, exhibit qualities of introversion and extraversion. However, these behaviors aren’t necessarily synonymous with human extraversion and introversion, as originally defined by psychologist Carl Jung in the 1920s. Put simply, people can explain their own motivations; pets can’t. While we may be able to distinguish when our reserved behavior is caused by discomfort versus personal preference, pinpointing the cause of a dog’s behavior isn’t always as direct.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n“There are many factors that may contribute to a dog’s personality,” says Robert Haussmann, a certified dog trainer, behavior specialist, and cofounder ofDogboy NYC. He notes that “early learning, socialization, and life experiences can all lend themselves to a dog being outgoing or reserved.” This aligns with a recent study ongenetics and behavior in dogs, which suggests that breed isn’t necessarily a strong indicator of an individual dog’s sociability.\nEvery dog is unique. There is no single diagnostic test to determine your pet’s personality type. However, if you’re looking to understand your pup’s behavior a little bit better, here are eight signs that suggest your dog may be more introverted.\nThey get overwhelmed easily.\n“Being introverted shouldn’t be associated with nervousness,” says Haussman, clarifying that nervousness is an indicator of stress or discomfort while introversion is “a normal state of being for many dogs.\" However, a dog that is more introverted may find social situations overwhelming more quickly. He cautions against repeatedly putting an introverted dog in stressful environments, like passing an uncomfortable pet around at a social gathering because you think they need to “get used to it.” Keep an eye out for signs of overwhelm, like crouched posture, excessive panting, lip licking, and yawning out of context.\nThey like their alone time.\nLike nervousness, shyness may be a sign of stress or a result of a lack of socialization as a puppy. According to Becky Mathia, a CPDT-KA withWayside Waifs in Kansas City, the longer a puppy goes without socialization (e.g., meeting people, meeting dogs, get accustomed to a collar and leash), the more likely that dog is to be shy when it comes to new experiences in their adult life. However, as Mathia notes, a dog who has always preferred to keep to himself may simply prefer solitude and isn’t necessarily cause for concern. Like introverted people, introverted pets may feel most comfortable by themselves rather than in a big group.\nThey don’t show interest in other dogs.\nDoes thisTikTokof an “introverted” dog meet-up look familiar? Rest assured, your pet isn’t alone in their apparent disinterest in making friends. “Some dogs are just more reserved,” says Haussman. He says this isn’t something pet owners need to be concerned about unless it’s negatively impacting their daily quality of life. If that’s the case — for example, your pet seems to have anxiety anytime they have to leave home — Haussman recommends consulting with a trainer who specializes in behavioral issues.\nThey get social fatigue quickly.\nPersonality types aside, dogs often get tired after playing, socializing, even spending a lot of timesniffing. But some dogs hit their social max quicker than others. You know how a busy day of seeing friends can leave you “peopled”-out, needing some alone time to recharge? Your dog may feel the same. If you’re concerned that your introverted dog isn’t getting enough mental stimulation, try introducing differentenrichment toysor games to get them engaged.\nThey freeze when overstimulated.\nThough less obvious than flight and fight responses, Mathia says that some dogs respond to stress by freezing or fidgeting. Freezing, in particular, may be difficult to spot, especially if you have a more reserved pet. Take note of behaviors that come up when your dog is in a new or busy social setting. “Once the dog finds out what works for them in making the scary thing go away, they will continue that behavior until the human recognizes and understands that they need our help,” says Mathia. For a dog that’s more introverted, that may be freezing in response to stress.\nThey’re choosy with human friends.\nA friendly dog isn’t necessarily always interested in making friends and meeting new people. If you notice that your dog limits their interaction with new humans, it could be an indicator that they lean introverted. In fact, Mathia says this a sign of your dog knowing and establishing their boundaries in a healthy way. She says a dog that “separates from something that makes them nervous—[going] to a safe space like a crate or room where they know they can decompress—is a good thing.”\nThey stick to their routines.\nOne way extraversion shows up in animals is in their willingness to engage with the unfamiliar. A more extroverted dog may be more curious in new environments while an introverted dog may be more comfortable sticking with what’s familiar. If your dog fits into the latter category, preferring what they know verses something new, they may thrive with a more structured schedule. Try establishing a consistent daily routine that balances enrichment and solitude, like taking walks in a quieter area or making sure they have alone time before or after a more social day.\nThey’re a “velcro dog.”\nVelcro dogsshare a lot of behaviors with a pet that leans introverted. In particular, they cling to the person or handful of people they feel safest with. Unless this clinginess is accompanied by other signs of discomfort, your pet probably just likes being around you. “Dogs that are introverts are great companions,” says Haussman. Lean into this rather than forcing them to play with other dogs or engage in overwhelming environments. As Haussman adds, introverted dogs are simply happy to hang with their people, make a few dog friends, and sniff around the neighborhood—and they'll live a productive and fulfilling life doing just that.",

    "title": "What Is “Mlemming” and Why Do Dogs and Cats Do It?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/pet-behavior/what-does-mlemming-mean"
  },
  "page_content": "“Mlem, mlem, mlem.” Hear that?\n“Mlem, mlem, mlem.”\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nThere it is again. What is that? What ismlem?\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the sound/term mlem, don’t worry. Neither were any of the highly experienced pet behavior experts we asked about it. “I’m honestly not sure,” says Joey Lusvardi, certified cat behavior consultant atClass Act Cats.\n“What is it?” asks Jessica Jacobson, a dog behavior expert atDapper Dog Trainingwith nearly 20 years of experience.\n“I had to look it up,” saysStephen Quandt, feline behavior consultant atCat Behavior Help. “At first, when I googled it, all I saw were videos about lemmings and the weird noises they make to defend themselves.”\nMlemming has nothing to do with lemmings, though. Rather, it’s the sound a dog or cat makes when they stick out their tongue to lick something, especially their own nose, lips, teeth, or gums.\n“I’d call that sound more of ashlerp,” Quandt adds. Which is fine. If you had to come up with your own word for the sound your pet makes when they lick their chops — not knowing that such a word already exists — you might not come up with mlem either.\nWhere did the word mlem even come from?\nIt doesn’t sound like English. But it is. Sort of. It’s an onomatopoeia, aka a word that imitates the sound it describes. And it’s pretty new to the lexicon. Itfirst appeared on Urbandictionary.comin 2015 and was added toDictionary.com’sslang compendiumin 2019. According to the latter, the first recorded use of the word is in a meme posted to Imgur and Reddit in February of 2015. The sound is also said to mimic the noise Yoshi makes when he sticks out his tongue after being punched in the back of the head by Mario in 1990’sSuper Mario Worldvideo game.\nOnomatopoeias can be quite personal and often differ across languages and cultures. Take the word “woof” for example. Ask an Italian speaker what sound a dog makes, and they’re likely to say “bau bau” instead of “woof woof.” A Russian speaker, on the other hand, might say “gav” instead of “woof” and a Korean speaker would likely say “meong.”\nBut whatever you call it, the mlem sound itself seems to be pretty benign. “I don’t think the sound carries any specific intent,” Quandt says. “It’s not a warning or an invitation. It’snot like a hissora meow. It’s just a sound. And an involuntary one at that.”\nJacobson agrees: “I think it’s just a sound. I don’t think it actually means anything in and of itself.” The licking that produces this sound, however, can be indicative.\nWhat does it mean when your pet licks around their mouth?\nAccording to Jacobson, a dog licking their chops can be indicative of a number of things: “It can be asign of stress, depending on the circumstances and the dog’sbody language, or it can indicate that they are relaxing, which seems to be how mlems are usually characterized in memes and social media.”\n“This sort of licking can also be asign of stress in cats,” Lusvardi says. “Cats will sometimes lick their nose as a displacement behavior, which is basically a cat equivalent of a fidget and a way of relieving stress. They could also lick as a way of cleaning their teeth or it could be an indication that they just ate something tasty.”\nBecause chop-licking can be an indicator of stress and an attempt to self-soothe, it’s a good idea to be on the lookout for it, whether it is accompanied by a mlem sound or not. Especially if you are considering interacting with a dog or cat you don’t know or don’t know well. If they are exhibiting signs of distress, even ones as subtle as licking their lips, take it as a warning to keep your distance.\nExcessive licking can also be indicative of underlying psychological or medical issues, but the key word here is “excessive.” If your cat or dog is justmlem, mlem, mlemmingall day and night, then, yeah, you should probably look into that.\n“If you don’t seek out and address the cause of whatever stress or discomfort is causing them to lick so much, it could lead to aggression, litter box issues, or other unwanted behaviors,” Lusvardi says. “And, as always, any sudden change in your cat’s behavior, especially if and when accompanied by other behavior changes, should be taken as an indication that they need to be seen by a vet.”\n“Excessive grooming, in particular, is often a sign that there is some sort of underlying medical issue,” Quandt adds. “Sometimes it can even develop into something calledpsychogenic alopecia, which can lead to hairthinning or baldness.”\nHe says excessive licking can even be part of your cat’s response to much moredire medical issuesof which you may otherwise be unaware. My sister’s cat, for instance, began excessively licking toward the end of his life, turning his otherwise white fur brown before she and her partner took him to the vet, where he was diagnosed with cancer. (This isn’t to scare you, but anytime you notice a behavior change like this, it’s a good idea to talk to your vet.)\nPer Jacobson, excessive licking in dogs can also be a cause for concern. “In general, licking can be seen as preening or cleaning, but a ‘urogenital checkout’ is when a dog licks their own genitalia and this, combined with a lip-lick and a yawn, would tend to indicate stress.”\nJust like with cats, “licking one spot over and over on their own body can mean that a dog issuffering from allergies,” Jacobson says. “But there are also dogs that lick purely to get their owner’s attention.” So, look at your own behavior before jumping to conclusions about your dog’s health. And remember that if you give your dog or cat attention every time they lick themselves, they may do it just to elicit that response.\n“Licking surfaces can also be cause for concern,” Jacobson says. But it really depends on the context. For instance, a dog could lick something because they like the taste of it, or they could be trying to get information about a thing or place that they cannot get from scent and sight alone. “And if the action becomes repetitive, it could indicate boredom, a cognitive issue, or that yourdog has ingesteddrugs/hemp/CBD.”\nLicking can also be a form of overt communication, like saying “please,” or “thank you,” or “I value your attention.” “Licks, especially after petting, can sometimes indicate that the dog is asking for more pets,” Jacobson says. “Or that they are appreciative of the pets you’ve already given them. Licks can also be affectionate without asking for anything in return, especially if they areaccompanied by soft eye contact.”\nIn all these cases, though, it is the licks themselves — the amount and context — that are indicative of potential issues, not the mlem sound your pet makes while licking. Mlem is just a funny internet word that started popping up on social media in the 2010s and is slowly making its way into the broader collective consciousness. Maybe a little less slowly now that you’ve read this article.",

    "title": "10 Signs Your Dog Trusts You",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/signs-your-dog-trusts-you"
  },
  "page_content": "As a rescue dog mom of two, I’ve spent a borderline-absurd amount of time thinking about trust. When I brought each of my dogs home, I wanted to create a warm, safe environment — so I scoured the doggie-parenting books, stocked up on fuzzy beds and enrichment toys, and loaded up on training treats. But every now and again, I’ll catch a side eye from one of my pooches and find myself swimming in self-doubt.Do they really feel at home with me, I wonder,or do they just put up with me because they like the luxurious accommodations?\nInsecurity can creep into any relationship, but with human companions, we can at least broach our worries in a direct conversation over brunch (preferably after a mimosa or two). With dogs, it’s not so simple.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\n“Dogs don’t experience the world through the same cognitive and emotional framework that humans do,” says Brie Blakeman certified trainer and founder and CEO ofNoble Woof Dog Training. “When we describe a dog as ‘trusting’ us, we’re using anthropomorphic language to interpret observable behaviors through a human lens.”\nIn other words, your dog isn’t thinking about you the way youthinkthey are. But really, when most of us ask if our dogs “trust” us, we just want to know that they feel comfortable, secure, andhappy in our presence. And that, at least, is something we can confirm based on how they act.\nSigns your dog trusts you\nYou can tell a lot about how a dog is feeling by how they carry their body.\nFor instance, Kristine Adams, dog trainer and behavior consultant and owner ofWoof Wisdom,asks, “Is theiroverall bodyloose or tight? Do they wiggle or remain stiff?” The former is a sign of comfort; the latter is a sign your dog might be feeling tense.\nRelaxed earsare good — especially if, as Blakeman notes, they continue to move easily in response to sounds. Other signs your dog is feeling cool as a cucumber include a relaxed face; loose lips, perhaps with the tongue hanging out; a natural-looking tail position with “loose, flowing movement”; a level head; and a “smooth gait with elastic, bouncy steps.”\nIn contrast, a dog who’s feeling uncomfortable might appear tense, with pricked-up orpinned-back earsand wide eyes that show the whites. They might engage in displacement behaviors, likelicking their lipsor yawning, or theymight pace around.Their mouth might be closed tightly, with corners pulled back, andtheir tailmight be tucked between their legs or wagging high and rigid, rather than loose and playful. They might seem hypervigilant, oreven growl, snarl, or bark.\nIf you’re still wondering how your pup is feeling, take a look at their beautiful peepers. Their eyes should be almond-shaped, Blakeman says, with normally dilated pupils.\n“With humans they feel comfortable around, dogs often display relaxed eye contact that is brief and soft rather than fixed or avoidant,” Blakeman says. “Their eyes may appear to ‘smile’ with [a] slightly narrowed shape and relaxed surrounding muscles.”\nAlso, if their eyes happen to have little hearts floating around in them, that never hurts.\nNo, we’re not talking about frizz. Instead, look at your dog’s back and neck for raised hackles. If they’re feeling really uncomfortable, those stiff hairs on their spines will stand up straight. A smooth coat might not automatically mean smooth sailing, but it’s a start.\nA comfortable dog should remain relaxed or even lean into gentle handling, Blakeman says. On the other hand, if your dog’s general response to affection reminds you of Kuzco inThe Emperor’s New Groove— “No touchie!” — you might have a problem.\nIt can help to examine how your dog responds to “less-fun, but necessary tasks,” Adams adds. For example, “can you put on their harness, bathe them, clean their paws,trim their nails, or provide care without holding them down or causing undue stress?” If so, you’re probably doing just fine.\nJust like people, dogs’ breathing canchange when they’re nervous. Theymight begin panting, even if the temperature is cool. A dog that’s feeling relaxed should display “regular and even” breathing, Blakeman says, panting only if it makes sense for the climate (or, perhaps, they’ve been active and are cooling down).\nIf your dog is engaging you in an afternoon frolic, you can assume they consider you part of the pack.\nDogs play differently with humans than with other dogs, Blakeman says. You can look for “distinctive pawing motions, head tilts, and specific vocalizations calibrated for human attention.” Dogs even move their tails differently when playing with people: “The wag may be broader and more exaggerated with humans than the more subtle,nuanced tail positionsused with other dogs.” Cute!\nAnd of course, playful dogs will often roll over andshow off their belliesto humans they feel comfortable around — “a behavior that shows significant vulnerability.”\nResting by your side — especially in deep sleep — is a “vulnerable behavior,” Adams says, and therefore a good sign. Eating, meanwhile, can be a little more complicated.\nAs Adams puts it, “A dog who eats in your presence ortakes treatsfrom you is likely feeling safe.” That said, “Some dogs are stress eaters (just like some of us!), so it’s one piece of a bigger puzzle.”\nProximity can be a solid indicator of comfort, Adams says, but as with many signals, there’s some nuance.\n“Some dogs use proximity to create space — like rushing toward a person or dog to make them back off,” she says. “In the child-dog world, this is sometimes called the ‘kiss and dismiss’ phenomenon. Dogs may also lean into orjump on peoplenot from excitement, but as a way to gain space.”\nAt the same time, Adams points out, “somedogs who love youmay still prefer distance. One of my own dogs wants to be in every room with me — but always stays about three feet away. My other dog, however, wishes she could live in my pocket.”\nIf you’re trying to figure out what your dog is trying to tell you, try referring back to their body language.\nThis one also requires close observation. If your dog sticks to you like glue with a cheerful attitude, Adams says, you can consider it “a strong affiliative behavior.” But if they’re following you around like a cartoon watchdog, closely monitoring your every move, they probably feel unsure. To find out which it is, Adams says, “Always look at the full picture” (aka body language).\nAt the end of the day, the best way to know if your dog feels safe and comfortable around you is if they rely on you toprovidesafety and comfort. For instance, Adams asks, “When startled or upset, do they look to you and move toward you, or do they retreat and seek distance?” If they’re running toward you and not away from you, that’s a pretty solid answer.\nWhat to do if your dog doesn’t trust you\nDogs might not “trust” the way humans do, but just like people, their sense of security can be earned (and lost) over time.\nTo avoid scaring your dog, meet them where they are. “Don’t force contact,” Adams says. “Slow everything down. Give themchoice and agencyin as many situations as possible.”\nIf you’re juststarting to build trust, don’t engage your dog. Sit in the room without looking at them or interacting. Let them come to you. “When they do approach,” Blakeman says, “resist reaching or touching — let them set the pace and nature of physical contact.”\nBlakeman also suggests positioning yourself sideways, rather thanfacing an anxious doghead-on — which they might read as confrontational. “Avoid hovering over them or making rapid movements that might trigger startle responses,” she says. “Lower your body position to appear less physically imposing.”\nRoutines are key to creating a predictable environment, Blakeman says. Keep feeding, sleeping, and exercise times regular to create stability. Usepositive reinforcementto reward desired behaviors, and use consistent verbal cues to avoid confusion or frustration.\n“Quality time together creates positive associations,” Blakeman adds. “Engage in activities your dog genuinely enjoys rather than those you think they should appreciate.”\nA more formal way to create positive associations, Blakeman says, isdog trainerSuzanne Clothier’s “Treat and Retreat” protocol.\nClear an area large enough for you and your dog to have a “safe zone” between you and a “safer zone” behind where your dog is sitting. Then, gather high-quality treats like pieces of cheese, cut-up hotdogs, or shredded chicken. To start the game, throw a treat at your dog’s feet before tossing two more into the “safer zone” behind them, allowing them to “retreat” and fetch them.\nWatch your dog’s behavior as they retrieve the treats — look for smooth movements without hesitation or concern about what you might be doing behind their back. Repeat as necessary until your dog seems relaxed grabbing treats from behind them.\nThen, start throwing two treats at your dog’s feet and one into the “safe zone” between you, and repeat as necessary to build their confidence. Limit sessions to five to seven minutes apiece, with periodic resets in between and a decompression activity afterwards.\nOnce your dog looks secure approaching the treats between you, you can start engaging in eye contact, talking to them, turning toward them, or even standing and moving. If none of these tips seems to do the trick, it might be time toconsult a traineror veterinarian. After all, a dog’s life is too short to waste feeling anxious and unsafe — especially with you, the person who wants to be their best friend.",

    "title": "Do Dogs Really Do a “Contentment Ceremony” When They’re Happy?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/dog-contentment-ceremony"
  },
  "page_content": "If you’ve spent time on “PetTok” or other social media recently, you’ve probablyseen videosfrom pet parents claiming to show their dog’s “contentment ceremony.” This often involves a pup rolling around on their back, legs flailing in the air (with their bits out and open to the wind) or rubbing their face in blankets or grass. These videos claim these little rituals are a dog’s way of saying thank you or expressing happiness after a meal or positive experience.\nWe know that dogs heavily rely onbody language to communicate. But are contentment ceremonies really a scientifically backed phenomenon?\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nAre contentment ceremonies a real thing?\nCertified dog trainer Sassafrass Patterdale says that while contentment ceremonies haven’t necessarily been proven by scientific studies, theyarea real thing. When a dog is doing one of these silly little rituals, their body language is open and relaxed, which are signs that they are happy, comfortable, safe. “These behaviors are a great sign that your dog isn’t stressed and is feeling relaxed in the home,” says Patterdale.\nThat is the most-likely scenario, anyway. Sometimes, though, it could also mean that they are just doing something practical, likerelieving an itchyback or face. Or maybe they are rolling in something smelly in the yard, an evolutionary behavior to mask their own scent.\nThere’s also a chance that these repeated behaviors may be a product of good oldpositive reinforcement. For example, if you notice your dog rolling around in a truly adorable manner after a meal and react positively (like withhigh-pitched praise), they will be more likely to repeat what they’re doing. Anything to get a delighted squeal out of their person, right?\n“Such behaviors can be downright endearing and make us feel good as well,” veterinary behaviorist Deborah Bryant adds. “Communication is a two-way street!”\nIs it OK to encourage a contentment ceremony ritual?\nHaving alittle ritualto share with your pet is just plain cute. Maybe you make that gleeful noise, which sends them into a merry fit on the floor or in the grass. So, is there any harm in using positive reinforcement to create a contentment ceremony with your dog?\nBryant says building strong communication with our pets does have the potential to strengthen our relationship with them. However, approach any high-energy behavior with caution — especially after dinnertime. Riling dogs up right after a meal couldlead to digestive issuesor even bloat.\n“Follow the old adage of ‘rest and digest’ after your dog’s meal, with the exception of some brief behaviors of ‘feeling good,’” Bryant advises.\nAlso, keep an eye out for unusual post-meal behaviors or body language that might indicate your dog is actually feeling discomfort. Signs likelip-smacking, “hard” swallowing or gulping,excess burping, staring into space, or upward “tucking” of their abdomencould indicate pain, nausea, or gastroesophageal reflux (what we know as GERD or heartburn). If you are at all concerned they are experiencing symptoms ofgastric dilatation volvulus(GDV) — aka a twisted stomach — like vomiting or a hard or tense stomach, call your vet immediately.\nSo, how do we actuallyknowwhen dogs are content?\nSo, a ceremony may not always be a sign your pup is celebrating their joy. But here’s what we do know: Dogs express themselves in all sorts of ways, withbody languagebeing their main form of communication. Pinpointing when a dog is “happy,” “content,” or “satisfied” is more difficult — defining what happiness looks like for ourselves is hard enough.\n“However, as current science has shown us, it’s clear that dogs have emotions,” Bryant says. “So, the prospect of dogs experiencing the feelings of contentment, happiness, and satisfaction are all possible.”\nThe key, Bryant says, is recognizing your dog’s unique physical signs so you can better interpret what’s running through their brains. Some dog breeds may be easier to read than others. For example, it’s probably easier to interpret a Labrador’s expression than to decipher the wrinkled face of a Bulldog. But there are other things you can watch:their tailandear positionsare a great tell.\nYour pup likely has their own behaviors that might clue you in on their emotional state. Some dogs are highly expressive and may jump around, fueled by their excess energy. Other dogs may be more demure, showing their satisfaction with a wide-sweeping tail and a relaxed face and body.\nBuild a bond with your dog.\nWhile contentment ceremonies may not be scientifically recognized, it’s clear our pups have their own adorable ways of expressing happiness and satisfaction. Learning to spot the subtle cues your dog sends is key to understanding when they’re feeling joyful.\nWhen your dog is flopping around on their back, open legs, tongue lobbing out without a care in the world, you should feel good about yourself as a pet parent. (Even if that particular ceremony’s partial purpose is to itch a hard-to-reach scratch, they’re still itching with ease in front of you — a signal that they’re comfy being vulnerable in your presence.)\n“If your dog is displaying these signs of being happy and content, that’s a good indication that you’re doing a good job,” Patterdale says. “Dogs who are displaying these‘contentment ceremonies’ are dogs who likely are getting their physical and mental enrichment needs met and are generally happy dogs.”\nAnd you can absolutely encourage those sweet behaviors, as long as you’re careful not to overdo it, especially around mealtime. At the end of the day, cherishing those specialmoments with our palsis one of the best parts of pet parenthood.",

  "page_content": "One of the most agonizing experiences for pet parents is also one of the first. It’s the heartbreak and uncertainty of what to do when your new puppy is whining, crying, andwhimperingat night.\nDr. Aimee Warner, resident veterinarian atWaggel, recalls helping a couple through the agonizing first few nights with their tiny new Spaniel puppy. “As first-time pet owners, they told me how distressing it was, especially since it was the puppy’s first night at home, and she was surely missing her litter,” Warner recounts. “The husband and wife took turns curling up next to her crate, just to let her know she wasn’t alone. By reassuring their puppy that they were there, she gradually settled into the home and slowly learned her new sleeping space.”\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nEven if you’ve done it more than once, or if you have a multi-dog household, it never gets easier hearing your new puppy cry. Warner says puppies cry because they miss their mother and their littermates, and they’re adjusting to their new environment. “What you can do is place their crate near your room or by your bed to help reduce nighttime anxiety. This can make them feel secure so they can develop healthy sleeping habits,” she says.\nWhy do puppies cry at night?\nPaige Gordon, a professional dog trainer withSpiritDog Training, says new puppies are going through a lot. “A new puppy cries at night due to separation anxiety or loneliness, as they have usually been through many changes in a short time, going from living with their mother and siblings to a new space without everything they’re accustomed to.”\nAbored puppyis one who has trouble settling down at night, and can be destructive. Puppies expend energy in short bursts throughout the day. Providing mental and physical stimulation at corresponding intervals will ensure your pup has had all the activity and engagement they need (with no excess energy) for a quiet night.\nGoing back to experts’ observation that puppies cry at night because they no longer have the comfort and security of their littermates, it’s reasonable to expect them to cry because they’re lonely. Give your pup plenty ofexercise and attentionduring the day, and place their crate near your bed to offset nighttime loneliness.\n“Puppies with separation anxiety can cry for quite some time, usually until someone comes to check on them as they become more worked up,” Gordon says. Try to soothe your puppy with your voice, and let them out when there’s a pause in their crying.\nApuppy can hold their bladderabout one hour for every month of age. If they are restless and crying, and it’s been longer than you can reasonably expect them to hold their bladder, take them out. “If your puppy has to go to the bathroom, they will likely carry on with crying in their crate at night until we either let them out or they are no longer able to hold it and relieve themselves in their crate,” Gordon says. “If your puppy is persisting with crying beyond a few little complaint cries, first try taking them out to the bathroom to see if they have to go.”\nYes, itispossible.\nHow long will my puppy cry in their crate at night?\nWarner says adjusting to a crate routine should take no more than three weeks. “When initially presented to a crate, more often than not, puppies must acclimatize before they settle in for sleep. If they’ve never slept alone before, pet [parents] can expect that, at first, they will whine, but this will diminish within five nights.”\nWarner advises empathy and consistency. “Remember that you’re not required to do an all-or-nothing approach,” she says. “Just like how you’re getting used to having a puppy at home, your pup is also going through a transition. There’s no one-size-fits-all solution. Do what works best for you, your puppy, and your lifestyle.”\nHow to soothe a crying puppy\nTo some, a puppy’s pitiful cries are worse than the sound of a crying baby. Try placing the cratenear your bedfor the first few nights, so your puppy can see you and hear the sound of your voice. “Having the crate or puppy sleep area in your own room can help to alleviate some of the separation anxiety your puppy may be struggling with,” Warner says.\nA crate is like a pack-n-play or a crib for a baby. It keeps the puppy safe at night and, over time, becomes comfortable and familiar. It replicates the natural denning instinct (similar to a dog house), and it’s portable. It fosters a secure, independent pup lessprone to clinginess. There are lots of great resources about crate training at Kinship, including a comprehensive, step-by-stepguide to crate-trainingandcrate-training your puppy at night.\nWarner says to start by letting your puppy explore the crate, giving them toys and treats to make it comfortable. Leave them alone for a few minutes, and gradually build up to longer amounts of time, though never longer than they can be expected to hold their bladder.\nLet them out before they cry. If they do start crying, wait until they pause to release them, or you risk teaching them they’ll be let out when they cry. Keep the experience positive, andneveruse the crate as punishment. “Be patient, and let them get familiarized with the crate, as a gradual approach can help them understand and associate it with a safe space,” Warner says.\nMake sure your puppy gets enough exercise, so they sleep soundly at night. “Trying to give them more mental and physical enrichment during the day, and give them something to help settle at bedtime, like a chew may be beneficial,” Gordon says.\nChoose a crate that’s the right size for your puppy. If your puppy is going to grow a lot, section off part of a larger crate. “It should be cozy and inviting, but still roomy enough for them to stand up, turn around, and lie down comfortably,” Warner says.\nLimit water within a couple of hours of bedtime, andtake your puppy outjust before you put them in the crate. Then set your alarm according to how long you think they can hold it: three hours for a three-month-old puppy, four hours for a four-month-old puppy, and so on. “Puppies have small bladders, and most of them will not be able to hold it through the night when we first bring them home,” Gordon says.\nBesides being ridiculously cute.\nWhen should I worry about my puppy crying at night?\nWarner says new pet parents need to remember that it’s normal for puppies to cry at night. “If it becomes persistent and escalates, then you notice they start vomiting or become lethargic, it might mean they have a medical issue that needs attention or they have severe anxiety,” she says. “If your puppy shows signs of distress, consult a canine behaviorist or a veterinarian at your earliest convenience. Trust your instincts and get your puppy the support it needs.”\nFAQs\nNew puppies cry at night because they’re used to sleeping beside their littermates and are experiencing separation anxiety. Puppies also cry because they have a full bladder, they want attention, they’re bored, or they’re lonely.\nLet your puppy out if it’s been a while since they’ve peed. If that’s not the reason they’re crying, place the crate near your bed to alleviate loneliness and separation anxiety.\nCrate training can take a week or up to a month, depending on the age of the dog. Once you get them comfortable in the crate with cozy bedding, toys, and treats, you can gradually increase the amount of time you leave them in the crate.\nWhen introduced gradually and consistently (and used correctly), a crate is a good method for keeping your puppy (and your home) safe. Crates teach independence and become a puppy’s refuge, but should never be used as punishment.\nThe general rule of thumb is that a puppy can hold their bladder one hour for every month of age. If you have a three-month-old puppy, you should be letting them out every three hours.\nConsult a canine behaviorist or a veterinarian if the crying doesn’t abate after three weeks. It might mean your puppy has a medical issue orsevere anxiety.\nReferences\nDog Behavior Tips.

    "title": "Why Do Dogs Always Take Up the Entire Bed When They Sleep With You?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/why-do-dogs-take-up-whole-bed-sleeping"
  },
  "page_content": "As dog parents, we spend a lot of time talking about training — ways to gently convince our precious pooches tocome when we call, not topee inside the house,and to sit quietly while waiting for a treat (or five). But what about the ways that they trainus? For instance: I used to be a person who sprawled out all over the bed while sleeping. But now that I share it with two small dogs? Let’s just say that fully extending my legs is a privilege I rarely enjoy.\nI call this phenomenon “dog-spreading.” For whatever reason, some dogs don’t just like to sleep in the bed — they defy the laws of physics by expanding to twice or thrice their normal size, stretching their limbs and turning into dead weight that refuses to be moved. After midnight, I swear my 25-pound dog turns into a boulder, plastering herself against my thigh and cornering me in what feels like two square inches of mattress space until dawn mercifully breaks. How does she do it?Whydoes she do it? These are questions that do not concern her, because she’s already asleep. But still, as I lay awake at night wondering what this might do to my joints after a few years, I knew I needed to get some facts.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThe short answer, of course, is that dogs are a lot like people and all have theirindividual sleeping preferences. “Some like to curl up into a cozy little ball, while others prefer to sprawl out like a starfish,” says Dr. Brian Hare, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University and author ofPuppy Kindergarten. “Some want to lean into your warmth, while others are champion kickers — it really depends on the dog’s personality.”\nIn other words, as veterinarian Dr. Betsy Challen, certified dog and cat behaviorist and owner ofPawsitive Animal Careput it, “Once you invite a dog into your bed, you never know what you are going to get.” That said, you don’t have to lie helpless in the dark. If your dog’s sleepy-time antics are driving you barking mad, you have some options.\nWhy do dogs take over the whole bed?\nThe longer answer is that we kind of brought this on ourselves. Historically, both Challen and Hare point out, dogs were not often found in human beds. Before the 1980s and 90s, Hare says, “sharing a bed with your dog often meant waking up with fleas or ticks.” But in the 20-plus years Challen has worked as a veterinarian, she’s watched dogs move into the house after decades of sleeping Snoopy-style in backyard dog houses. Now, she says, many have their own beds and playtime set-ups.\n“So, to many dog owners, dogs are like children,” Challen says. “And in this way, [pet parents] naturally have the inclination to have their dogs, often starting at the age of a puppy, sleep in their beds.” Obviously, Hare notes, the rise of preventatives has made nighttime cuddling a lot more appealing as well.\nAs natural pack animals, Challen says, dogs are used to sleeping together in dens, so sharing our beds is usually a no-brainer. At the same time, as many of us have noticed while waking up with our best buds’ rumps in our faces, “they don’t alwaysmake the best bed-mates.”\nWhy is your dog burrowing under the blankets?\nWhile some doggos like to hermetically seal us into a small spot by pinning us under the covers, others prefer to snuggle up beneath the sheets. According to Hare,burrowing is usually completely normal— “unless it’s paired with signs of anxiety or distress.”\nMore often than not, dogs who like burying themselves in cotton are natural burrowers to begin with, Challen says.\nOne such breed, according to dog trainerAnthony Sorosky, is the Daschund. “They are almost always preferring to be under the covers, often all the way down to your feet,” he says. “These dogs are wired genetically to pursue their prey down into the ground. Hence theshape of their body. They are quite good at it, too. Imagine if your job was to chase a badger down a hole and pull it out by its toes. You would have to be pretty comfortable in tight spaces. You may actually feel more comfortable in tighter spaces and prefer them.”\nIs it OK to try to move your dog while they’re asleep?\nMy dogs might not appreciate this answer, but yes, if your dog’s chosen sleep spot is standing between you and some precious ZZZ’s, it’s totally fine to wake them up or gently coax them into another spot. “Just gently nudge them over — unless they’re elderly, in pain, or have a history of aggression,” Hare says. “Otherwise, they’ll probably just reposition and fall right back asleep.”\nIt’s natural to feel hesitant, especially given that old saying about “letting sleeping dogs lie.” But for those who find themselves reluctant, Challen offers a little pep talk.\n“When it comes to dogs and pets in general I often think, whose house and bed is this anyway?” Challen says. “The dog usually has its own bed and has chosen to sleep in ‘your’ bed or has been invited into your bed by you. If your dog is waking you up throughout the night and making you sleep in an uncomfortable manner then I think it is completely fine to remove your dog from your bed. After all, your dog doesn’t have a job to go to in the morning, a test to take… you get the idea. Let the dog know when he is welcomed in your bed, but also when he is not.”\nAnd if your dog chooses not to play nice and refuses to leave the bed? “It may be time to take a good look at the relationship you have with your dog,” Challen says. Sorosky agrees: “Look around, and you will probably find a few other places where the dog is getting his [or] her way at your expense.”\nWhat should you do if your dog growls when you try to move them?\nAs tempting as it might be, don’t ignore the behavior. Instead, Challen says, “I would immediately assess the situation and get the dog off the bed.”\nAlittle growlmight seem innocuous. But Challen has seen many situations in which pet parents did not intervene and then saw the behavior escalate — especially when new people like friends, new romantic partners, or children enter the bed.\n“I have had to counsel many owners on what to do in this situation, and proactivity is the key,” Challen says. “If your dog is growling when touched or moved and is left to continue in this manner, it can lead to aggression.”\nIf you’re concerned about your dog’s growling, Sorosky suggests using a leash at night. If your dog growls, do not let them stay on the bed. Use the leash to remove them from the bed without reaching for their collar. “Sometimes, if your dog starts to realize that it is his own behavior that can get him an invitation onto the bed or get him sent off, he’s likely to make a change,” Sorosky says.\nIs it wrong to banish your dog from the bed after letting them sleep in it?\nNope! As Hare points out, “Dogs are incredibly adaptable — it may take a bit of time and consistency, but they can absolutely learn a new routine.”\nIn some cases, your dog might already have their own safe place, like a bed ora crate.These spots can come in handy when guests or children are around, Challen says, in case your dog needs a place to settle down. If your dog already feels comfortable in their own bed, you should feel no qualms about sending them there at night.\n“You will find after a while that your dog may prefer to sleep here not only overnight but during the day, when there are [storms] or when he is feeling like he wants to be left alone,” Challen says. “One of my clients missed his special cuddle time with his dog before bed, but no longer wanted his dog sleeping on the bed with him. He was willing to go cuddle his dog on his dog’s bed, in his safe space, prior to going to bed for the night. This was a win-win situation after both parties got used to it.”\nIf you’re starting from scratch, Challen says basic cues like “up” and “off” can teach your dog which places are suitable for sleep and which are not. Hare also suggests making your dog’s new nighttime digs “as positive and rewarding as possible.” Make sure the spot feels safe and cozy, and try feeding your dog meals and treats there to create happy associations. “Also,” Hare says, “a nice long walk before bedtime helps — if they’re tired out, they’ll settle in more easily.”\nAt the end of the day, Sorosky says, “dogs are more flexible than we may think.” So, if you’re losing sleep to a pooch who insists on taking up the entire real estate of the bed, trust in your bond and find an arrangement that works for both of you.",

    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/should-i-not-say-words-that-get-my-dog-excited"
  },
  "page_content": "As dog parents, wedote on our pupsconstantly, obsess over their every move, and maybe buy them cute little outfits for special occasions. And just like those who’ve sired human offspring, we, too, tend to develop a list of words to avoid saying in front of our babies.\nWhile people with kids might spell out things like “i-c-e-c-r-e-a-m” to dodge certain meltdowns after dinner, dog parents often become walking thesauruses for words like “walk,” “outside,” and “dinner.” The logic here is fairly obvious. No one likes a tease, including our pups. (Have you ever seen your dog’s face when they mistakenly expect a treat? I wouldn’t wish that heart-piercing look of betrayal on anyone!) And so, guided by the fear of disappointing our best friends, we bust out the synonyms or our spelling-bee skills.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhen I want to know if my boyfriend is ready to go outside with the dogs, I never actually use those words. Instead, I’ll throw out a casual, “Do you want to go downstairs?” The word “dinner” often gets spelled out — “d-i-n-n-e-r” — or we’ll get creative and use something like “chow.” The system is foolproof, but I’ll admit, I sometimes wonder if it’s actually necessary. My dogs generally ignore much of what I say — including, sometimes, when I actuallywanttheir attention. Are they really going to notice or care if I use the word “beach” and do not immediately pack their portable bowls and towels into the station wagon?\nAs with so many pet-care questions, the answer is, “It depends.” According to the experts I spoke with, your dog’s reactivity will likely come down to how you usually communicate.\nWill your dog be disappointed if they hear “outside” and don’t get to go outside?\nAnecdotally, yes — probably. But not for long. According to Eileen Koval, certified dog behavior consultant with the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants, our dogs “may feel stressed or even tricked if we have created such strong meanings and powerful emotions by repeatedly using the word in conjunction with a certain activity” and then do not complete the expected activity.\n“If dogs are already at a place where they seem disappointedor confused,” Koval says, “it can be helpful to direct them to another enjoyable activity.” If the issue arises repeatedly, you might want to avoid using the word altogether.\nFortunately for us, dogs have shorter memories than we do, so rest assured, if you say the word “dinner” around your dog and fail to deliver one time, they likely won’t be scarred for life.\nWill your dog stop trusting you after multiple misunderstandings?\nPossibly, but not necessarily.\nAccording to Koval, dogs can sometimes begin to mistrust us over time if we repeatedly stoke their expectations and then don’t deliver. “They may begin to ignore other things that the human says,” she warns, or fail to follow other cues we’ve trained.\n“Trust is built initially through positive transactions — we say we will do something and then we follow through, or we ask them to do something and then we follow through with a reward,” Koval says. “When there are promises that are not kept (from their perspective) they eventually may lose trust.”\nAt the same time, Dr. Zachary Silver, director of Occidental College Canine Intelligence Lab, says context matters. “Hopefully, people aren’t getting their dog’s attention, saying ‘walk,’ and then not taking them for a walk,” he says. “Hopefully, this is coming from the context of eavesdropping, in which case, maybe they become a bit more discerning about when they respond. They start to recognize that that word only carries meaning for them when it is used with dog-directed speech.”\nAs with most aspects of dog training, the key here is consistency. To keep yourdog’s trust, help them understand what speech is meant for them and what is not. Reward them when they respond correctly, and redirect their energy toward something more productive when they’re disappointed. And if all else fails, you can always go back to spelling things out.\nDo dogs actually understand human speech?\nYes and no.\nAccording Silver, there are different schools of thought on this question. That said, the bulk of the evidence suggests that dogs can form associations between words and concepts through repetition.\n“So if you say ‘outside’ every time you take your dog outside, they’ll eventually learn what that is,” Silver says. “...But it really is based on the association between the word that you’re saying and that next step.”\nStill, dogs’ brains don’t work the same as ours. They take longer to learn new words, and they don’t have the linguistic flexibility to understand the difference between, say, “Do you want to go outside?” and “Do you want to go outside in an hour?” In that sense, we need to be deliberate in how we speak around them.\nThe best way to communicate with your dog is through something called “dog-directed speech,” and the good news is, many of us do this automatically. You know thatdog voicewe all have, where we raise our timbre and perhaps speak slower than usual? That’s a hallmark of dog-directed speech, alongside two other tools — establishing eye contact and starting sentences with their names. For example: “Lucky, do you want to go outside?”\nDogs pick up new words faster when taught through dog-directed speech, and according to Silver, this way of talking to them can also serve as a potential deterrent for  the eavesdropping that we mentioned above — that is,dogs listening to our conversationsand picking out relevant words. So, if you want to be able to use words like “dinner” and “beach” in casual conversation, make sure to only use dog-directed speech when teaching your dog new words. The rest of the time, use these words like normal so that your dog can learn the distinction.\nAre our dogs always listening?\nThis is where the “it depends” part comes into play. Every dog is different, and so is theirlevel of attentiveness. It also matters how you normally communicate with your dog.\n“If you primarily communicate with your dog using dog directed speech, then they'll likely only interpret those words as being salient to them when you’ve produced that similar speech directed towards them,” Silver says.\nOn the other hand, there’s always a chance that dogs’ word associations will grow strong enough that they begin to pick them up in regular speech, especially if you often talk to them in your normal voice — something Koval has noticed with words like “dinner,” “park,” “walk,” and “ball.”\n“I think it is important to continue using words in non-dog related contexts in normal tones of voice so that they can learn when the word is a predictor of something pertaining to them — and also when it is not a predictor,” Koval says.\nIf you use an exciting word around your dog and they don’t react, you can assume they don’t expect anything. In these situations, Koval says, “they likely hear the word just fine but do not have an over-emphasis on its meeting as always pertaining to them.” That kind of interaction is healthy.",

    "title": "Why Do Dogs Bury Bones?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/why-do-dogs-bury-bones"
  },
  "page_content": "Every time my dog, Lilac, gets a new bone, she buries it right away. Watching her dig a hole is almost worth the money I spent on the bone itself. She carefully places the bone inside the hole, nudging the dirt over it with her nose. She does all this with an air of solemnity, mostly in the soft soil around the base of plants. If it’s cold, she’ll dig a shallow hole in the decomposing brown leaves at the edge of the woods and cover the bone with leaves. Months later, she retrieves the partially decomposed prize.\nVeterinarian Dr. Marc Smith, owner ofNatchez Trace Veterinary Services, says dogs are highly instinctual creatures, despite centuries of domestication and their reliance on us. Their close relatives, wolves, often bury their food to protect it from scavengers.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n“Your dog might bury its bones based off genetically instinctual behaviors,” Smith says. “Although your dog probably does not have scavengers looking to steal its precious bone, this instinct still lies within them.”\nThe bone in question might instead be a treat, a toy or coveted chew. Kinship has aguide to the safest options(spoiler alert: it’s pig ears and bully sticks). There’s also advice aboutwhat types of bones are safe for puppiesand why it’snever safe for dogs of any age to have rib bones.\nWhy do dogs bury bones?\nDr. Aimee Warner, resident veterinarian atWaggel, says a dog’s instinct to bury bones is a behavioral tendency inherited from their wild ancestors. “Wild canines used to cache food for future consumption, particularly when food was not always available,” Warner says, adding the urge remains particularly strong in hunting and guard dogs. “It’s a survival mechanism for them. Some still do it now, even in the house — by ‘digging’ on the carpet or pushing imaginary dirt onto a toy or treat. It’s such a great demonstration of instinct.”\nResource guardingis definedas your dog’s protective behavior toward food or a toy it fears another animal might steal. My first dog, Grendel, would attack other dogs for approaching her toy or take another dog’s toy and growl at them if they tried to get it back. “Resource guarding can happen in many different ways, sometimes burying bones and sometimes even in the form of aggression,” Smith says. “If your dog is burying their bones as a form of resource guarding, your dog is trying to hide its bone [to keep it] from being stolen.”\nDigging and hiding are stimulating, sensory behaviors that entertain dogs, Warner says. Garden soil, couches and clothes baskets are ripe for exploring. Digging a large hole in the garden is one of many things dogs do for entertainment, Smith says. “Sometimes dogs will bury their bones to stimulate themselves,” he says. “This could be due to thembeing boredand not having a good source to put their energy into.”\nWarner explains that digging can be a symptom ofanxiety and stress, like boredom. “Burying is an anxiety/stress-relieving mechanism in some canines, particularly under routine or situational stress,” she says.\nTerriers and Dachshunds are among the dogs bred to hunt underground animals like gophers who were threatening farmers’ crops. They’re so good at digging that the American Kennel Club (AKC)developed Earthdog, a simulated sport for underground hunting dogs. In the absence of activity that speaks to their deepest instincts, dogs will dig vigorously in soft, yielding soil or bedding to soothe themselves. “Sometimes, dogs just need a sense of security to make them relax,’ Smith says.\nThe historical roots of burying behavior\nUnderstanding the roots of your dog’s behavior can help you appreciate their connection to history.\nImagine a hole in the ground as a refrigerator for your dog’s ancestors. Like us, your dog’s wolfish forbearers appreciated a consistent food supply. Within canine evolutionary history, burying is a wolf’s deeply rooted solution to a persistent problem.\n“Burying their excess food allows them to have food whenever they need it,” Smith explains. “They also live in the wild, thus leaving food out and about will attract all sorts of scavengers to come and steal their excess food.”\nShould you let your dog bury bones?\nIf your pup’s digging is sporadic and doesn’t damage your yard or home, it’s generally harmless, Warner says. “If your dog is having some small bury-and-dig nirvana and is not ruining furniture, soiling beds or being overly possessive, then it’s fine,” she says.\nSmith agrees and says it depends on your tolerance. “Generally, the only reason to stop this behavior is if it is harmful to you,” he says. He cautions that digging can lead to more destructive behaviors. “For example, this urge to dig in the yard could suddenly turn into an urge to dig a hole in your couch,” he says.\nHow to stop your dog from burying bones\nA tired dog doesn’t have the energy to dig. Warner advises making sure your dog is well-exercised mentally and physically. If burying bones is a form of mental stimulation, Smith suggests trying a toy that was made to stimulate digging behavior. These snuffle mats could be a great option to curb your dog's destructive behavior while still giving their energy an outlet, he says.\nObserve what items your dog likes to bury. My dogs, for example will bury bones and chews but not treats and toys. “Sometimes the best way to eliminate a problem is to start at the root of the problem,” Smith says. “If your dog is only digging around their bones, removing the bones does not give the dog a chance to exhibit that behavior.”\nSometimes digging is the symptom of abundant energy that can find another outlet. Give your dog an engaging chew or toy. Smith mentions toys that are designed to stimulate a dog’s desire to dig. “These dig mats can be filled with treats making the dog want to dig and helping to get out that desire,” he says.\nDogs are infamous diggers, bones or not. I still find (and narrowly avoid) holes my dogs dig looking for mice in the fields around our house.Training your dog not to digis possible if you’d rather not twist your ankle walking through your own yard. Warner suggests providing them with a sandbox or garden bed to place objects and bury. If encouraged, they’ll likely return to that area. “If your dog is having a hard time curbing the urge to dig, sometimes a compromise is a great choice,” Smith says. “By redirecting this behavior to one specific location, it can be easier to control and manage.”\nIf the behavior seems obsessive, is destructive or impossible to redirect, Smith advises meeting with a veterinarian or behaviorist to unearth (no pun intended) the cause. “The best way to deter the behavior is to first discover why your pet does this,” he says. “If you can discover the why, you can then figure out how to stimulate your dog in a way that deters the digging behavior.”\nFAQs\nDog bury bones and toys out of instinct to protect or save those items for (in their minds) times of scarcity. Their first instinct might be to dig outdoors but, failing that, the pillows and blankets on your bed are soft, yielding and familiar.\nNo, not if you don’t mind your dog digging a hole to bury the bone. Much of canine behavior that mystifies us comes from deeply instinctual places. Some dogs were bred to dig (think terriers) and it’s in their genes.\nSome are more likely to dig than others. Terriers, Dachshunds, Beagles, Schnauzers, and Border Collies are among the high-energy working dogs bred to dig for small animals. Huskies dig to keep themselves cool.\nStrategies include limiting access to bones, fencing off favorite excavation areas, redirecting the behavior or creating a designated digging area.\nReferences\n“Why do dogs bury bones?” SPCA New Zealand, Dr. Jess Beer,https://www.spca.nz/advice-and-welfare/article/why-do-dogs-bury-bones",

  "page_content": "If you’re a devoted pet parent, chances are you’ve been the target of an affectionate lick (or hundreds) while giving your pup well-deserved pets. But have you ever pausedmid-belly rubto wonder why your dog licks you when you pet them?\nThere’s more behind slobbery love licks than affection. Whether your dog gently laps your hand during cuddle time or enthusiastically launches into a full-blown face wash, licking is packed with meaning. It’s a blend of biology, instinct, emotion, and communication, like your dog’s version of sending a multi-layered emoji.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nRead on to dig into the most common reasonsyour dog licks youwhen you pet them and what it reveals about their adorable canine psyche.\nMain takeaways\nDogs lick while being petted as a natural expression of love, bonding, and pack behavior.\nDogs lick while being petted as a natural expression of love, bonding, and pack behavior.\nLicking helps dogs explore your scent, taste, and emotional state.\nLicking helps dogs explore your scent, taste, and emotional state.\nIt can also be a clever way to get your attention or signal that they want more affection.\nIt can also be a clever way to get your attention or signal that they want more affection.\nSome dogs lick to self-soothe when they feel anxious, uncertain, or stressed.\nSome dogs lick to self-soothe when they feel anxious, uncertain, or stressed.\nWith consistent training and positive reinforcement, licking can be managed without damaging your bond.\nWith consistent training and positive reinforcement, licking can be managed without damaging your bond.\nThey especially love to do this when they’re ignoring you.\nMost common reasons your dog licks you when you pet them\nThis one’s the crowd-pleaser: Your dog licks you because they love you. Licking is a natural way for dogs to show affection andstrengthen their bond with you. Just like puppies lick their littermates and mothers to express closeness, adult dogs carry this instinct into their relationship with their human family.\nStudies show that lickingreleases endorphinsin dogs, which are natural feel-good chemicals that create a sense of pleasure and comfort. It’s a win-win: you pet them, they feel loved, they lick you, and they feel even more loved.\nDogs explore the world with their mouths more than their eyes or paws. When you reach out to pet them, your scent and the feeling of connection trigger curiosity. Licking is their version of checking you out.\nThat lotion you just put on? The faint smell of whatever snack you had three hours ago? All fair game for investigation. Pups may be decoding your story one lick at a time. To your dog, your skin is an interactive scratch-and-sniff book with bonus cuddles.\nLicking is a behavior deeply rooted in canine instinct. According to Dr. Ushi, a veterinarian in Wesley Chapel, Florida, mother dogs lick their pups to groom them, encourage them to breathe, and stimulate bodily functions when newborns. As pups grow, they return the favor, and the licking habit becomes embedded in how dogs relate to those they love.\nSo, when your dog licks you while you’re petting them, they may be treating you like part of their pack, offering grooming and bonding in return for affection. They won’t try to clean your ears (hopefully), but the impulse to care for their loved ones runs deep.\nSometimes, licking is a smart strategy to demand more attention. Your dog learns quickly that licking gets a reaction. Maybe you laugh, pet them more, talk to them, or give them a treat (the jackpot in dog currency). While petting them, they may lick you to encourage you to keep giving them affection. Or, if they feel ignored, they may lick you to shift your focus to them.\nDogs are excellent social learners. If licking equals interaction, they’ll use it as a tool to get what they want.\nLicking can also be a self-soothing behavior. If your dog feels anxious, overwhelmed, or uncertain, they may lick as a calming mechanism. It helps them regulate their emotions; they settle themselves down through repetition.\nYou may notice your dog licking more in new environments, during storms, or after a stressfulvet visit. If licking increases dramatically or seems compulsive, it could be a sign of underlying anxiety.\nYour skin is a flavor-packedimprint on your dog. Pups have 300million olfactory receptors(compared to our six million) and use licking to enhance their sensory experience. When you pet them, your scent transfers to their mouth, giving them more information about where you’ve been, what you’ve eaten, and how you’ve felt emotionally. Dogs can detect changes in your hormones and health through scent, so, if your dog licks you when you’re upset or sick, they may respond to subtle shifts in your emotions and wellness.\nTraining and managing licking behavior\nWhile licks may be adorable or heart-melting, it’s OK if you don’t want to be turned into a salt lick whenever you show your dog some love. The good news is that you can manage this behavior without hurting their feelings or damaging your bond.\nThe key to guiding your dog’s licking habit is to reward the behavior you want and dissuade the behavior you don’t. If your dog stops licking when you gently say “no lick” or redirect their attention, immediately praise them or offer a treat. Over time, they’ll learn that calm cuddles without the tongue will get the same warm reaction. It’s about reshaping their response without punishing their instincts.\nConsistency is your best friend.Mixed signals, such as sometimes laughing or sometimes scolding in response to licking, will only confuse your pup, making training harder.\nIt’s OK toset gentle boundaries. Dogs thrive on clear communication. You can use verbal cues like “enough” or “good job,” paired with redirecting their attention to a toy or chew. Some pet parents train cues like “kiss” or “no kiss” to establish licking as an on-cue behavior rather than an all-the-time habit.\nIf your dog gets excessively enthusiastic duringpetting sessions,it may help to pause affection when the licking starts. You can resume pets and rubs once they settle. This helps reinforce that calm behavior earns more attention.\nWhen should you seek professional help if the licking gets out of hand\nThere’s a point where licking becomes excessive, and if your dog won’t stop licking you or themselves, it could indicate an underlying issue, such as:\nAllergies orskin irritation(licking paws, legs, or the air)\nAllergies orskin irritation(licking paws, legs, or the air)\nPain or discomfort\nPain or discomfort\nObsessive-compulsivebehavior\nObsessive-compulsivebehavior\nSeparation anxiety\nSeparation anxiety\nCall a veterinarian or certified dog behaviorist if licking escalates into a compulsion, disrupts your dog’s daily routine, or seems linked to distress. They can help rule out medical causes and guide you toward behavior modification techniques that protect your pup’s well-being.\nPro tip: Keep a behavior journal. Track when the licking happens, how long it lasts, and what’s happening around your dog. This can provide valuable clues for professionals.\nOK, dude, that’s a little gross...\nBottom line\nWhen your dog licks you while you’re petting them, it’s usually a blend of affection, curiosity, comfort, and instinct. Think of it as their unique love language — messy, endearing, and sometimes over the top.\nWhile most licking is normal, you can teach your pup when and how it’s appropriate. With gentle training and positive reinforcement, you’ll find the perfect balance of tail wags and kisses to connect you both.\nNext time you’re enjoying a snuggle and feel that familiar lick, smile. It means your canine loves and trusts you.\nReferences\nAmerican Kennel Club.The Most Popular Dog Breeds of 2023.

  "page_content": "Did you accidentally “reply all” and tell the whole company far-too-personal details about why you will be out of the office and can’t make a meeting? Or maybe you walked into a conference room — only to bang right into a glass door?\nAnything can catapult a perfectly normal day into a lousy one, and from there, who knows how low you can go? But there’s nothing like arriving home to a creature who accepts you for who you are (and does not care that you inadvertently called your boss Mom).\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nScientists have found thatdogs knowwhen we’re feeling down. But what happens if that bad day or moment festers into a lingering sadness? Maybe you’re grieving or maybe you have a tough medical condition, or maybe you’re just upset about the state of the world (valid). Sometimes, it’s not possible to shake off the blues like you shook off the embarrassment of announcing to the whole team you’d rather eat dirt than play pickleball at the company off-site. In some cases, it might take time to get better.\nAnd that might make you wonder if your sadness can make your dog sad, too.\nWhat does science say about our relationship with dogs?\nStudies have actually shown thatdogs recognize our emotions, and they’re even good at mirroring our behavior. “Dogs can tune into our emotions and can recognize when their people are stressed, tense, happy, worried, sad or upset,” saysTatiana Yastremski, a certified dog trainer and canine behavior consultant atSt. Hubert’s Animal Welfare Centerin Madison, New Jersey.\nOne study showedthat dogs can evensmell human stressvia a hormone called cortisol, which means that if you’re fretting over something, your dog is going to pick up on it. “They are also keen on observation and will observe the smallest changes in our body, from tensing our bodies to a change of facial expressions,” says Dr. Ambika Vaid, an integrative veterinarian andpet food adviserin Denver.\nWhat’s more, thelonger you’re together, the more your emotions — or at least your stress levels — are linked. So, that means that not only is there a possibility you and your dog act similarly (it’s science!), but your emotions may also be synced.\nCan our sadness make our dogs sad?\nIn most cases, stress has been studied more than “sadness” in our pups. As to whether dogs becomesadwhen we are, the explanation is trickier. Vaid doesn’t exactly think our dogs mirror sadness.\n“Our dogs do not necessarily get sad when we are sad; more so, they become aware of it and want to comfort us,” says Vaid, whose dog cuddles or nuzzles her when she’s down. “Dogs tend to mirror more stress andanxiety from usthan sadness.”\nIt’s natural to worry that your dog may be upset if you are; after all, you want the best for your bestie. But it’s important not to assume they’re feeling something they might not be. “I know that as humans, we want to believe that our dogs’ response to our feelings of sadness is because they also feel sad,” Yastremski says, but that’s not necessarily the case. “Our dogs observe us and our body language very keenly. While they may not feel sad when we’re sad, they will likely match your activities or behaviors.”\nThat means that if you’re less active, they probably will be, too. So, if they’resleeping more, it’s probably because you’re sleeping more, and they’re just following suit. And rather than an emotional reaction to our sadness, they may experience an environmental reaction. For example, when they see that you’re upset, your dog might grab onto a toy and chew intently, according to Yastremski.\n“I don’t necessarily think that they feel exactly the way we feel, but they could respond to our sadness with specific behaviors that may indicate they are uncomfortable,” she says.\nHow can you tell if your dog is feeling down in the dumps?\nWhile it’s not really accurate to say that your dog is “sad,” they can definitely have changes in their emotional states that result in grumpiness, for avariety of reasons. You might note a sudden drop in energy, lack of appetite, sleeping too much, panting, withdrawing, or becoming clingy, Vaid says.\nBecause they may mirror your behavior, “they may nap, they could appear a little lethargic, they could whine, or sigh deeply as they are finding a spot to lie down, or they may engage in mischief because they are bored,” Yastremski adds.\nHow can you keep your dog happy?\nVaid says that it’s important to stick to your pet’s routine as much as possible to keep them feeling safe and secure. And, it should go without saying, you have to take care of yourself. “Taking the time to journal, going on long walks with our pups, and dealing with our sadness helps prevent our pets from taking on those emotions with us,” she says.\nAs thistrainer notes on TikTok: “The first thing to do if you really want to help your dog is to help yourself.” It’s similar to a phrase — “You can’t help others until you help yourself” — uttered by many a therapist.\nIt might be wise to realize, too, that as long as your dog is getting their needs met during a brief difficult time (that means, adequate food and nutrition, regular exercise, and positive interaction) thatit’s OK not to be yourself. If you find that you can’t take them on as long of a walk, consider asking a friend or neighbor to help out for a while and seek help from a therapist if you need to.\nDon’t feel that you have “to push through your feelings of sadness to entertain your dog,” Yastremski advises. That could just add to your stress (which, of course, your dog will pick up on).\n“While I don’t necessarily think that dogs feel sad when their humans are sad, if you’re worried about it, you could do something special for your dog during those times,” Yastremski explains. “You could settle your dog with a long-lasting chew like a bully stick. You could provide them with a food puzzle or perhaps take out their favorite snuffle mat to sniff out delicious treats.”\nAnd remember that every dog is an individual, and not every pup gets down in the dumps when their person is; we needthis kind of optimismthese days.",

  },
  "page_content": "If you’ve ever taken your dog to a daycare or dog park, you’ve probably noticed their first order of business is to sniff other dogs’ butts. Sure, they may be saying “hello,” but does it have to be so… invasive?\nAs weird as it may look to the human eye, butt-sniffing is actually a healthy, normal behavior for dogs. And if the dogs engaged in the behavior are supervised and properly socialized (as well asoff-leash), letting pups sniff each other out can actually be a good thing. Dogs whoget to know each otherare less likely to fight, and a thorough butt sniff can offer all the information your pup needs tomake a new friend.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n“Dogs primarily gather information about the world by sniffing (unlike humans who rely on sight and sound, so out of all of their senses, [smell] is probably the most important for how they learn to recognize and interpret the world around them,” Alexandra Bassett, dog trainer and behavior consultant atDog Savvy LA, says. “Their sense of smell is so powerful that it can detect scents that are hours or even days old, plus they can track scents over long distances.”\nMain takeaways\nDogs have an incredibly powerful sense of smell, allowing them to learn about other animals and people through scent.\nDogs have an incredibly powerful sense of smell, allowing them to learn about other animals and people through scent.\nThrough smell, dogs can pick up on the health, age, and even emotions of other dogs.\nThrough smell, dogs can pick up on the health, age, and even emotions of other dogs.\nResearch has found that dogs can even determine human moods and illnesses with their noses.\nResearch has found that dogs can even determine human moods and illnesses with their noses.\nWhy do dogs sniff everything?\nA dog’s olfactory system is incredibly advanced, especiallycompared to humans. For context, humans have about six million olfactory receptors in their noses, which may sound like a lot, but dogs can haveup to 300 million.\n“Their sense of smell can help them identify and track specific individuals, including their owners, family members, and other dogs, as well as changes in scentrelated to illnessor stress,” Bassett says. “A dog’s sense of smell is also closely linked to their brain’s emotional and memory centers, which means that smells can evoke strong emotional responses and memories in dogs.”\nYour pup can even smellscents layered on top of each other, picking up information in places where we can’t smell anything. But sniffing isn’t just about learning about the world around them, although that’s a big piece. Dogs also use their noses to navigate their surroundings simply becausesniffing is enjoyable for them.\nThere’s a reason that sweet little nose is always pressed to the ground.\nWhy do dogs sniff other dogs’ butts?\nWhy do dogs smell each other? This behavior is oftenseen as a greeting, but it’swaymore than a simple hello. Research suggests that a dog’s brain mayprocess smellsin a similar way to how the human brain processes sights.\nEvery animal (humans included) has their own unique scent, and dogs canlearn a tonabout others through these smells — as well as other behaviors, like licking. These identifying scents just happen to be more potent around the anus. Through a thorough butt sniff, dogs canlearn about the healthand even temperament of other dogs. That’s a lot of information located back there!\n“Dogs sniff other dogs’ butts as a way of gathering information about each other,” Bassett says. “Dogs have two small, oval-shaped sacs on either side of their anus called anal glands. These glands produce a fluid with a very strong smell that is unique to each dog and believed to emit pheromones — chemical signals that convey information about an individual dog’s identity, sex, reproductive status, and emotional state.”\nWhy do dogs sniff your butt?\nSniffing other dogs’ butts is one thing, but why do dogs sniffyou? Dogs have a tendency to go straight forhuman butts and crotches, much to everyone’s embarrassment, but they’re just drawn to the smells emanating from this area. Just like dogs, humans release unique, identifying scents.\n“It’s essential to remember that dogs are wired to follow their noses, and sniffing is a natural behavior for them,” Bassett says. “Human mouths, groins, and butts emit strong scents, which is why dogs instantly gravitate to them. While it may not be the most polite or socially acceptable behavior, it’s not necessarily a cause for concern.”\nDogs may sniff their human parents’ butts simply because they love you. Canines stay connected to other dogs by exchanging smells, and sniffing their human mom or dad is a way of expressing their closeness to you. If you’ve been out of the house, they could also use their powerful noses tofigure outwhere you’ve been, who you’ve seen, and what you’ve eaten. Research has even found dogs can tell their humans’emotional statesorwhether they’re illthrough smell.\nWhile crotch- and butt-sniffing is just part of a dog’s nature, it’s okay to discourage this behavior to avoid awkward interactions. Try redirecting your pup to another activity.\nA dog’s sense of smell can be 100,000 times stronger than a human—so when it’s bad, it’s bad.\nWhat a dog’s sense of smell reveals\nWhile we tend to use our vision to make sense of our surroundings, dogs rely more heavily on theirsense of smell. By sniffing another dog’s rear end, your pup can pick up ondetailed information, like the other animal’s age, health status, and diet. They can even determineif the other dog is ill, as well as pick up on their mood. Each dog (and person) has a unique scent that can help your dog “recognize” animals they’ve met before.\nDogs may also sniff each other’s butts to establish social structure. When two dogs meet each other, they will likely investigate via smell to learn more about who the other dog is. The dog who sniffs first may even be considered dominant in the interaction.\nWhy dogs sniff butts can also be related to pheromones. Canine anal glands contain pheromones that can reveal information about a dog’s identity to other dogs. Dogs can learn about another’s diet, health, age, gender, and even mood through these scents. A dog’s powerful sense of smell gives them context about other dogs (and people) they meet. They can even tellhow old a smell isto see how recently a dog has been in the area.\nReferences\nBucher, Steve. “Dogs Smell Cancer?

  "page_content": "What is it about wet legs that dogs find so enticing? It’s happened to us all before: You step out of the shower all nice and clean, you start to towel off, and all of a sudden, you feel a faint tickle on your calf. You look down and see your dog lapping the dew off your skin like it’s beef broth, and they haven’t eaten for days. What the hell is going on there?\nAs with most doggie behaviors, the reasons why dogs lick our legs after we’ve showed or moisturized can vary. To figure out what’s making your dog lick like there’s no tomorrow, you’ll have to use context clues.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nBut what if your dog licks alot? In some cases,compulsive lickingcan signal deeper problems. Also, if you’ve moisturized your skin after your shower and your pup licks it, certain ingredients could be putting them at risk. To get to the bottom of this behavior and learn how to keep dogs happy, healthy, and well-hydrated, I spoke with board-certified veterinary behavioristsKaren SuedaandCamille Squair.\nWhy does your dog lick your legs after you shower?\nThe answer here will depend on both the specific situation and your dog. Generally, dogs give us post-shower kisses to show affection, get new information, or, in some cases, quench their thirst.\nWhenever my dog licks my legs, my first thought is,Don’t you have water? Sometimes, however, it’s less about thirst and more about tasting something new.\nAs Sueda points out, the water in your shower might taste different than the water in your dog’s bowl — especially once it drips off your legs. “Water that has been left in a bowl for a while may taste a bit ‘stale’ compared to more aerated shower water,” Sueda says. “This may also be why some dogs like drinking out of a fresh bowl of water rather than one that has been sitting out for a while.”\nIf nothing else, your dog’s leg-licking could be a useful reminder to refresh their water bowl more often. Speaking of which, I’ll be right back…\nOK, I’m back.\nYou know that stereotype about how dogs miss us from the moment we leave their sight, even if we’ve only been gone for five minutes? Well, your showers probably last at least 10 — so there’s a decent chance that your dog is licking your legs because they are glad to have youback where they can see you.\nAs Squair points out, licking in general can also be a way for dogs to communicate that you’re part of their pack. By licking your legs after a shower, your dog might be trying to reinforce that bond.\nThis one’s less likely, assuming your dog hasconsistent access to water. Still, Sueda says, it’s possible that if your dog is licking your wet legs, they’re simply quenching their thirst. “Some dogs may enjoy licking water from a surface rather than lapping it out of a bowl,” she says, “similar to a person who enjoys sipping from a straw rather than gulping from a glass.”\nJust like your dog might’ve missed you during the short eternity you spent lathering up, they could be wondering what you’ve been up to. Per Sueda, “Licking may also be a way for them to gain information about your whereabouts.”\nIf your dog doesn’t often see your legs (like, say, because you usually wear long pants) that could also enhance the appeal, Squair says. “Maybe that section of your leg or area of your body isn’t always available for them to be able to groom and lick, and so it’s a novel place for them to be able to do that,” Squair says.\nDo you usually respond to yourdog’s kisseswith fawning responses and a lot of cooing? In that case, the post-shower leg snogs might be aplea for affection. “Your dog may lick you when you get out of the shower if they want your attention,” Sueda says, “especially since you’re a ‘captive audience.’”\nHow good is your dog with separation? For some dogs, even a brief absence can get the anxious gears turning — and as Squair notes, excessive licking can be a sign of stress.\nLickingcan be a type of displacement behavior, Squair says — a dog’s version of twirling their hair or shifting weight from one foot to the other when they’re nervous and don’t know what to do with their bodies. As she puts it, “There can be kind of an internal kind of soothing factor that goes with that.”\nTo be clear, not all dogs who like to lick wet legs have separation anxiety — and not alldogs with separation anxietywill be drawn to damp limbs. Still, Sueda says, if your dog seems unusually panicked when you step out of the bathroom, or if they show othersigns of anxiety, consult with your vet to rule out any deeper issues.\nShould you worry if your dog is licking shower water off your legs?\nThe first question you must ask yourself: Do you mind the licking or not? “If you don’t mind your dog licking your legs, no intervention is needed, unless you believe your dog panics when you are separated from them,” Sueda says. “If your dog only licks you occasionally, their behavior may not need to be addressed.”\nBut if youdon’tlike the extra attention when you step out of the shower, Sueda offers two suggestions:Shut the bathroom doorand/or offer your dog something more interesting to lick. Try out toys, likelick matsandsoothing saucersor a long-lasting treat, to redirect your dog’s enthusiasm. Or ask another member of your household to distract your dog with a walkor a toy.\nIf you’re worried your dog’s licking might signal a deeper issue, Squair suggests assessing their overall behavior to see how often it happens in other contexts. In certain situations, compulsive licking can reflectgastrointestinal (GI) upsetor esophageal discomfort. Check to see how easily your dog can be redirected away from the licking toward another activity. If it’s hard to break their focus, or if they keep returning to the behavior, it might be time to call the vet.\nWhy does your dog lick your legs after you moisturize?\nWe all have our vices. For some dogs, it’s shower water — and for others, it might be your favorite lotion that you put on after you’re squeaky clean. (Shea butter is still butter, after all... right?) Much like when you first step out of the shower, Squair says,the new smellsand tastes associated with your moisturizer might be appetizing to your dog. (“Some of them taste good.”) In other cases, your pooch might simply be sniffing out your new scent.\nSueda agrees that to some dogs, the taste of moisturized legs or hands might be even more appealing than shower water. “Your dog may enjoy the taste of the moisturizer or lick you to gain information about this novel scent,” she says.\nIs itsafefor your dog to lick lotion off your legs?\nThis will depend on the product, but in general, Sueda points out, lotions and skincare products are not intended for consumption — human or canine — and might contain ingredients that are dangerous for dogs. Besides, she adds, “the moisturizer won’t do you any good if your dog licks it off.”\nMost moisturizers are dilute enough that if your dog steals a stray lick off your ankle, they’ll probably be fine. That said, Squair says, if your dog is prone to licking, you’re best off avoiding highly concentrated essential oils or anyproducts containing xylitol, a sweetener that’s highly toxic to dogs and can be found in some lotions. Make sure you don’t allow your dog unmitigated access to your moisturizer — for your sake and theirs. And always make sure you look at the label to make sure they haven’t consumed something toxic if they do get ahold of it.\nWhen should your dog see a vet?\nIf your pup compulsively licks and has trouble refocusing on other things, it could be a symptom of a physical illness (like allergies) or, in rare cases, a neurologic disease. Squair recommends watching for changes in behavior, which could be another sign that something is wrong. If you notice a new behavior, ask yourself how often it’s happening and for how long — and whether it’s easy or difficult to get your dog to stop.\nIf your dog tends to lick orchew on themselvesalot, especially alongside other symptoms like vomiting orsoft stool, Sueda recommends scheduling an exam at the vet’s office to rule out illness or disease. After all, she says, “It’s always best to err on the side of caution.”",

  "page_content": "Most dog parents would say their pet has a personality, even a sense of humor. Once, while playing with my dog, I told her to go get her toy, and she returned to me with a live spider in her mouth. This left me with two questions: Is my dog funnier than me? Also, is my dogmessing with me on purpose?\nWhile the jury is still out on the former — though many signs point to “yes” — it isn’t uncommon for dogs to give us mixed signals, especially ones you could swear were intentional:\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nJumping out of the bathjustbefore you’ve finished fully rinsing the soap out\nJumping out of the bathjustbefore you’ve finished fully rinsing the soap out\nBegging to go outside only to immediately beg to be let back in\nBegging to go outside only to immediately beg to be let back in\nTaking your slipper and gleefully prancing around the house with it\nTaking your slipper and gleefully prancing around the house with it\nPawing to be pet, then acting stand-offish when given attention\nPawing to be pet, then acting stand-offish when given attention\nWaiting until you’ve finally finished putting on all their outdoor gear to kick off their booties in one fell swoop\nWaiting until you’ve finally finished putting on all their outdoor gear to kick off their booties in one fell swoop\nHearing “What do you have in your mouth?” as a sign to chew faster and then promptly swallow\nHearing “What do you have in your mouth?” as a sign to chew faster and then promptly swallow\nAnd oh, this one: making sure their butt is positioned just in front of your face before letting one rip\nAnd oh, this one: making sure their butt is positioned just in front of your face before letting one rip\nIf you’ve experienced what can only be described as “trolling” behavior, welcome. Fortunately, I spoke with a couple of experts about why your dog is messing with you — and what to do about it.\nWait, do dogs have a sense of humor?\nRats are known to laugh when tickledandapes will playfully tease one another, but does your dog understand when they’re being funny (especially at your expense)? While there is research to suggest thatsome animals may have evolved a sense of humor, it’s more likely that your dog isengaging in playrather than trying to pull a fast one on you.\nFor example, you’ve probably seen your dog give a “play bow,” with their front paws on the ground and their rear in the air. Margaret H.B., an educator at a Midwest animal shelter, says this is the best indicator that your dog is feeling playful. “Often they’ll be holding a ball or toy to make it incredibly clear they want to run, play, wrestle, etc.” she says, adding that dogs will play bow to people and other pets alike. In other words, if it seems like your dog is teasing you, they’re probablyjust trying to play. (As for the fart example, that’s just unfortunate timing.)\nDoes my dog associate “teasing” with play?\nThink about how you typically play with your dog. Is there a lot of keep-away? Fake-outs? Pretending to throw something and hiding it behind your back? Is this not you trolling your dog? When humans and dogs play together, both will typically engage in behaviors that are best categorized as “playful teasing.”\nIn fact, dogs will often signal that they are playing when the game at hand is particularly frustrating. As a 2024study on human-dog playfound, “play bows appeared to be integral to dogs’ play activities, usually when the dog was playing object-keepaway andtug o’ war, or the dog was reacting to the human engaging in frustration games like object-keepaway or fakeout.” Put another way, your dog might associate light frustration with fun.\nWhat if my dog is giving me mixed signals?\n“Sometimes, interpreting a dog’s behavior can be confusing,” admits Dr. Valli Parthasarathy, who is a co-owner of and Veterinary Behavior Specialist atSynergy Veterinary Behaviorin Portland, Oregon. She recommends paying attention to your dog’sentirebody languagewhen trying to understand their behavior — is theirtail waggingwhile they let out a low growl? Are their ears back (whichcould mean anxiety) when they are playing a confusing game of keepaway with their favorite ball?\nDr. Parthasarathy also says to remember context here: “Is there a pattern to when it happens? Could it be that they are trying to get your attention to do something [else]?” If your dog’s confusing bids for attention persist and accompany signs of discomfort (like growling), it could be a sign that your dog is physically uncomfortable. In this case, Dr. Parthasarathy recommends reaching out to your vet to check for anypossible medical conditions.\nHow can I get my dog to stop trolling me?\nTo generalize a bit, pet parents aren’t mad about this behavior. On the whole, we love our little babies no matter what they do, and to be honest, we probably love them morebecauseof their hijinks. But if they are truly are getting on your nerves, there are some things you can do.\nWhileyoumay be able to contextualize your dog’s behavior,theirunderstanding of context is much more limited. For them, keepaway is fun, regardless of whether it’s you with a tennis ball or them with your slipper. One solution? Both experts recommend familiarizing yourself with your dog’s specific behavior, particularly usingtraining classes.\n“Not only is training fun for your dog and strengthens the bond between you two, but it’s also an amazing opportunity to learn from an expert about what your dog is trying to tell you with their body language,” Margaret H.B. says. She advises checking your local shelter’s available training classes and keep an eye out for ones that focus onpositive reinforcement.\nIf nothing else, you can alway post videos of your dog messing with you with hopes of going viral. One pet parent’s temporary misery is the internet’s treasure.",

    "title": "Are Dog Yawns Contagious the Same Way People's Are?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/are-dog-yawns-contagious"
  },
  "page_content": "By now, it’s well-known that “catching” yawns from another person is asign of empathy. However, what about between dogs and humans? You and your dog have a precious, unbreakable bond; it makes sense that this would extend to yawning when they do. If you’ve noticed yourself yawning when your dog gets sleepy, you’re not alone.According toPsychology Today, contagious yawning is a sign of empathy between humans and dogs, too.\nIn humans, it relates to social bonding, and you’re more likely to pick up on your friends’ or family members’ yawns than you are strangers’. We already know thatdogs can sense human sadnessand have a level of empathy, so of course they might catch yawns from you when you’re sleepy after work.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nDog yawnsmightbe contagious to you, but pay attention to why they’re doing it.\nSian Lawley-Rudd is the founder ofLavender Garden Animal Services. She says that, in short, dog yawning can be contagious to humans and sometimes even to other dogs. “I’ve definitely caught myself yawning after my dog has, and I know I’m not alone! There’s even some research suggesting that dogs may ‘catch’ yawns from humans they’re closely bonded to, which is pretty amazing when you think about the emotional connection we share with them.”\nShe adds, however, that yawning in dogs can also be a low-levelsign of stressor discomfort, particularly if they are in an uncomfortable situation, suchas at the vet, meetingnew dogs, or after being reprimanded.“If a dog yawns when they’re snuggled up on the sofa and nothing is happening, they’re probably just sleepy. If they’re yawning repeatedly in a busy environment or after being asked to do something challenging, that’s often a sign they’re feeling overwhelmed,” Lawley-Rudd says. “Rather than brushing it off as just a cute moment, yawns can be a great entry point into understanding our dogs’ body language more deeply. They’re subtle, but they can tell us a lot about how our dogs are coping, and help us step inbeforestress escalates.”\nBy keeping an eye on everything about your dog’s behavior and what they’re doing with their body, you can start to discern how they feel, even though they can’t tell you with words.\nAnd contagious may not be the right word for it.\nLorraine Rhoads is the senior director of health and safety at doggie daycareDogtopia. She had lots of really interesting insights into dog yawning but is a little more skeptical of just how contagious it can be. “While yawning is often thought to be ‘catchy,’ the exact power of a dog’s yawn to make another dog or a human yawn remains uncertain,” she says. “Let’s begin by considering that when a dog yawns, it could be a sign of emotional expression, a social connection, or simply a response to feeling sleepy.”Rhoads adds that research,like this studyfrom August 2008, shows that dogs sometimes engage in contagious yawning when they see or hear a human yawn. “While some studies link this behavior to empathy, others suggest it may be more about unconscious mimicry or instinctive behavior.”\nMuch like in human-to-human yawn catching, Rhoads says that “dogs are more likely to catch a yawn from someone they know well, like their pet parent, rather than a stranger, which hints at a deeper social bond.”\nHowever, she adds that there is some disagreement among researchers about how common this behavior truly is. For example, while some studies report that over half of the dogs tested yawned in response to their owners, other research, such as data fromDr. Brian Hare’s Duke Canine Cognition Center, found that only five percent of dogs yawned contagiously. Rhoads says this uncertainty indicates that more research is needed to fully understand the connection between contagious yawning and social bonding in dogs.\nLike Lawley-Rudd, Rhoads points out that there are many reasons other than tiredness or contagious yawning why dogs yawn. They may do it when they feel anxious, stressed, or uncertain.\n“This type of yawning often occurs in situations where a dog feels uneasy, like during a vet visit or when they’re in a new environment,” Lawley-Rudd says. “Yawning in these cases is one of many calming signals dogs use to manage their emotions, often paired with behaviors likelip-licking, turning away, or avoiding eye contact. Understanding these signals can help pet parents and caregivers recognize when a dog may need space or some extra comfort to help them relax.”\nSo,canhumans catch yawns from dogs?\nInterestingly, she adds, while humans can catch yawns from one another and dogs can catch them from you, it’s less common for humans to catch them from dogs. “Humans rarely yawn in response to seeing a dog yawn. So, while you may find your dog’s yawns adorable, they’re unlikely to trigger your own,” she adds. That’s hard to believe; I’m sure many pet parents start to feel sleepy and want to yawn when they see their dog chilling and snoozing all day long, worry-free.\nWe might not think much of our dogs’ yawning, but it turns out it’s a pretty complicated behavior that relates to their wider wellbeing and happiness. There are all kinds of reasons why your dog might yawn, and one of them might be their intense bond with you.\nYou just need to look out for othercues in their body language, environment, and behavior that might indicate exactly why they’re yawning and whether it’s a sign of distress. Most of the time, though, you don’t need to worry. If they’re catching yawns from you, it’s just a symptom of how well-bonded you are.",

    "title": "Do Dogs Really Hate Being “Booped”?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/do-dogs-like-being-booped"
  },
  "page_content": "You are just minding your business, when suddenly, you see something out of the corner of your eye and can’t focus on anything else. It’s your dog’s cute little nose.\nDo you see it? Right there on that adorable little doggie face. Flanked by those big, soft doggie eyes. Just above that sweet, smiling doggie mouth and that dopey doggie tongue. They’re minding their own business, too, just existing. But all you see is a big wet adorable snoot, just sitting there all wet and glistening and waiting to be booped! You just can't help yourself.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThis adorable little gesture may seem harmless, but for oneBernese Mountain Dog named Frankie, it really gets on her nerves — and the internet has found it quite entertaining watching herdodge her dog dad’s finger coming in for a pesky boop.\nBut what about dogs without a TikTok following? How do they really feel about being booped? Are they just as bothered as Frankie?\nWhat is booping?\nBooping is when you touch or lightly tap the tip of your dog’s nose with your finger, often while saying the word “boop” in your highest, cutest, sing-song-y voice. It’s a sign of affection and a way to release the pressure that builds up inside you when you look at your dog and are so overwhelmed with love for that precious little slobber machine that you think you’re going to explode. You just boop the nose and the pressure releases. Like pushing the lever on a whistling kettle when the water starts to boil.\nAaaaah. Sweet silence.\nWhat does booping feel like for dogs?\nPeople love to boop. Dogs, not so much. Most dogs anyway. Maybe not your dog. But probably.\n“A dog's nose is most likely the most sensitive area of their body, so any contact, even a light one, is overwhelming for them,” says Dr. Aimee Warner, resident veterinarian atWaggle Pet Insurance. “Physically, they may havehistories of allergiesor injuries that would make it uncomfortable to be booped. Mentally, if a dog already has traumatic associations with injuries on the nose and all that, then there is a strong chance that they would hate it if they touch the nose or even the face.”\nEven if your dog has no such history or allergies, touching their nose could still be overwhelming, as dogs have up to 300 million olfactory receptors in their noses (humansonly have six million) and the space in their brains devoted to processing and understanding scent is about 40 times larger than ours. Their nostrils work independently, and their brains combine the scents they gather into a single scent “picture,” much like our brains combine the images we take in through our eyes.\nSo, in a sense, dogs smell the same way we see: in 3D. And wet noses take in even more of this information, trapping scent particles in a thin layer of mucus, which means touching their wet noses can be jarring for them. It’s kind of like shaking up a camera and then distorting or blurring the final picture.\nHow can you tell if your dog likes being booped or not?\nIf you’ve ever bopped your dog, you probably already have a sense of whether or not they enjoy it. “If the dog approaches when you boop, then they enjoy it,” Dr. Warner says. “But if their body freezes up or they turn their back on you, then they don’t enjoy it.”\n“OK,” I hear you saying, ”but is it really that big of a deal?”\nWell, doyoulike having your face poked without your consent? Even if the action is quick and gentle, it can still be disturbing and destabilizing. And if you insist on booping your dog anyway — because you enjoy it, and you’re not really hurting them — just know that you could be damaging the relationship.\nThat sounds dramatic, but hear Dr. Warner out. “Booping a dog repeatedly, even when they dislike it, has immediate and lasting impacts,” she adds. “To begin with, it might agitate and distress them, therefore leading them to shun interaction with you. When you continue booping them, even when they are exhibiting avoidance, they may not want to play with you. It also has an impact on your relationship as a whole with your dog, because it impacts trust building and their feeling of safety with you. Snapping andgrowling are self-protective behaviorsand might also happen with some dogs. So, respect their space.”\nAnd never, ever, under any circumstances, boop a dog you do not know. It’s one thing to boop your own dog, but quite another to do the same to someone else. Even if a dog doesn’t particularly like being booped, they are more likely to tolerate the occasional pop on the nose from their person than from some rando they just met. Let’s flip things around again: Would you like some new acquaintance or stranger on the street touching your most sensitive parts? No, you would not! That person would be liable to catch a fist, and you, touching a strange dog’s snout, run the risk of pulling back a bloody finger (or worse).\nGood news: You can find an alternative to booping.\n“If your dog dislikes being booped, find alternative methods to show your love to them,” Dr. Warner says. “Scratch their ears or the area below their chin and on the chest.Belly-rubbingandgentle patting on the headare also enjoyed by some dogs.” Or you couldpat their butt, praise them, stroke their back, or give them a treat. There are so many ways to show your dog that you are bursting with love for them that they will actually enjoy. And you probably already know what those ways are. So, why not do one of those things, instead?\n“Remember that it’s important for your dog to feel safe with you,” Dr. Warner says. “Understanding how your dog wants to be shown affection builds trust and intimacy. And understanding their body language is crucial inbuilding a close relationship with them.”\nWhat if you absolutely have to boop something? What if, when you look at your dog’s sweet little nose, you feel as if you’re going to pop like a balloon? Point your finger at your own nose and give it a poke. I can almost guarantee that you won’t enjoy it, and you’ll soon free yourself of the impulse altogether.",

    "title": "How Do Dogs Know What Time It Is? Their Internal Clocks, Explained",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/can-dogs-tell-time"
  },
  "page_content": "It’s 4:59 p.m. Your dog sits next to their food bowl, waiting, ears perked. They watch as you move about the kitchen. At 5:01 p.m., they impatiently paw their bowl.\nSound familiar?\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nFor creatures who don’t wear watches, dogs sure seem to have an uncanny sense of when it’s time to eat, go for a walk, or go to bed.\nBut can dogs really tell time?\nWe spoke to Dr. Zachary Silver, director of Occidental College Canine Intelligence Lab, and Dr. Krista Macpherson, who studies comparative cognition and teaches at Western University in Ontario, Canada about how dogs perceive and understand time.\nThe short answer is: Yes, dogs probably do understand the passage of time in some sense. However, studying an intangible concept like whether dogs have a sense of time is quite difficult. Dogs, of course, also can’t verbalize what they’re experiencing. This leaves researchers to rely on observation and inference during trials.\n“You have to make sure that the question you are asking is the same question that they are perceiving,” Macpherson adds. “That can be a really tricky thing.”\nDespite the limited body of research around time perception in dogs, both experts we talked to say there are some things we do know and some things around which we can only make educated guesses. Here are a few factors that we think might impact how dogs understand time.\nBiology probably plays a big role.\nCircadian rhythms drive many biological processes, including eating and sleeping, in both humans and dogs. As a result, Silver says it’s not too hard to imagine that physiological signals, such as neurotransmitters or hormones, might signal to dogs when it’s time to eat.\nIn other words, when a dog’s stomach is empty, they likely get a signal from their body that they’re hungry; it’s time to eat. Another type of internal timing is called “interval timing,” which refers to perceiving a duration or period of time. Macpherson’s research has confirmed that dogs can track time in intervals, too.\nShe studied this in a lab by training dogs to hit a button, which would then cause a machine to spit out a treat. She then adjusted the button and machine, so that it wouldn’t spit out a treat until a full minute had passed, no matter how many times the dog hit the button.\n“It’s really funny to watch, because [the dogs] all do different things,” Macpherson says. “Some are smashing at the machine. Others are looking at [their pet parent], like looking back at the machine, looking at [their pet parent], because all of a sudden this thing isn’t working right.”\nMacpherson found that dogs would refrain from pressing the button when they knew they’d have to wait for a treat. Once it got closer to that one-minute mark, they’d start pressing the button more.\n“It would almost be surprising if dogs couldn’t do this,” Macpherson says. “But with dogs, theres always also the extra question of, well, we have selectively bred them for thousands of years at this point, so maybe we’ve bred out some of these things that would be natural.”\nSensory inputs might play a factor, too.\nSometimes, dogs seem to know when something is going to happen that can’t easily be explained by biological processes. For example, some dogs might be waiting at the door when you arrive home from work every day, even if you arrive at different times.\n“We know that dogs are able to use their sense of hearing, a sense of smell, in extremely sophisticated ways that, even in some cases, surpass our own understanding of how they use those senses,” Silver says.\nIn other words, he says, dogs may pick up on cues in their environments to predict when things should happen. For example, an increase in cars on the street might indicate people (including their own humans) are returning from work. Maybe dogs are paying attention to the position of the sun or certain scents.\nMacpherson says when she was an undergrad, she had a dog who would hide in her room when she wasn’t home. About 30 seconds before she would return home every day, the dog would come downstairs. “I think possibly it's that my old, rickety car made a particular noise that she was sensitive to,” Macpherson says. “But that’s just an example of a cue that my dog was clearly tuned into.”\nWe may play a bigger factor than you’d think.\nOur own daily routines, habits, and behaviors might also play a significant role in how our dogs perceive and understand time, Silver notes.\n“We know that dogs learn patterns extremely well, and that’s why they’re so effective at learning routines because they’re able to track which event goes first and what should follow logically,” he says. “We primarily think about that routine as being something that’s centered around the dog’s schedule. But dog lives are, in many cases, centered around our own schedules as humans.“\nIn other words, our dogs might be taking notes on our behaviors and building up patterns and cues between different actions. For example, your dog might know it’s time for breakfast because they smell coffee brewing and know you’re in the kitchen. Or, they might know a walk is imminent if they hear you ask Siri for the temperature and lace up your shoes.\nThis also explains why dogs do well with routines. Silver says routines can provide dogs with a sense of comfort because they know that their needs (such as food and exercise) will be met at a consistent time every day. Interestingly, Silver says that some dogs seem more attentive than others, regardless of factors like breed. He hypothesizes that a dog who is much more keyed into their human’s behavior probably also has a stronger perception of time than a dog who pays less attention.\nThere’s still more to learn about dogs and time.\nBoth Silver and Macpherson emphasize that time is a complex concept: Most likely, dogs understand and perceive time through a mix of biological, sensory, and social factors all working together. But there’s simply still so much to learn about canine cognition and how they perceive the world.\nSo, the next time your dog is waiting near their food bowl: Maybe they’re hungry. Maybe they’ve noticed the sun going down. And maybe they’ve noticed that you’ve logged off your work computer. Either way, signs indicate it’s chow time.",

So, what is it? Our codependence? My undeniable allure?

If this sounds familiar, here are a few reasons why your dog might be checking on you in the shower.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThey’re just curious.\n“Some dogs like to know what their people are doing and what they are up to,” says Valli Parthasarathy, who is co-owner of and veterinary behavior specialist atSynergy Veterinary Behaviorin Portland, Oregon. Dogslearn through smelland, simply put, the shower is a smelly place. Your dog may be drawn to the bounty of olfactory stimuli, and poking their head in is a way for them to appreciate the bouquet!\nIf they seem particularly interested in your scent post-shower, it could be for a similar reason: You smell different and they’re familiarizing themselves. Like scent, taste helps inform your dog’s understanding of the world, which is why your pup’s curiosity may extend to licking the water off your legs post-bath. Compliments to the chef!\nThey miss you.\nDogs are social creatures, though their social norms are quite different from our own. (See:butt-sniffing.) Your dog’s instinct to, say,follow you into the bathroomis their way of bonding. Dogs have aninnate desire for protectionand security, but, unfortunately, no measured understanding of the concepts of privacy or personal space. Parthasarathy says a dog’s habit of checking in while you’re showering isn’t an immediate cause for concern. However, she adds, “For some dogs, it canindicate increased anxietyaround being separated from their people.”\nA dog’sseparation anxietycan manifest in many different ways (whining, pawing,barking,excessive salivation). But, as one2018 studyfound, it typically indicates your dog is experiencing one of two things:fear or frustration. The study authors found that “frequent barking during separation may signal more frustration than fear in dogs,” So, if your dog’s shower supervision isaccompanied by vocalizations, they’re probably just having FOMO.\nThey like the attention.\nIt’s hard not to notice your dog’s nose snuffling its way around the shower curtain. So, unintentionally or not, you may be reinforcing the behavior. Do you talk to them when they check on your mid-shower? Give them pets? Engage in a game of peek-a-boo and poke your head out of the shower to look back at them? As theAmerican Kennel Club(AKC) suggests, attention to your pet’s behavior willreinforcethat behavior. Chances are you’ve given your dog some form of attention when they’ve come to check on you in the shower, which encourages them to continue to come check on you any time you are there. From your dog’s perspective: If not praise,why praise-shaped?\nWhat ifyoudon’t like the attention?\nMaybe it was cute the first few times, but now you’d just like a little privacy when you are literally naked in the shower. If your dog is getting a bit too nosy about your bath time, start by ignoring them. I know, I know. Easier said than done. But dogs are of the mind that any attention is good attention.\nIf you’re willing to take a more proactive step, try reinforcing the opposite behavior and reward them for staying outside the bathroom while you’re in it. If your dog’s behavior becomes concerning, Parthasarathy recommends consulting your vet orworking with a specialized trainer. And if all else fails, you can always, you know, shut the bathroom door.",

  "page_content": "As dog parents, we all have our pet peeves (pun intended). Some can’t standexcessive barking. Others might cringe a little whenever our precious pooches lays a big,wet kisson their cheeks. And don’t even get some folksstartedon their pups’digging habits in the backyard. But what about our pets? Do they also have a list of peccadillos they can’t stand?\nOf course they do! Like all sentient creatures, our dogs love certain human behaviors and loathe others. The question is which ones bother your specific dog.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nTo help get you started, we recruited two experts to help us compile a list of situations that breed frustration — veterinary psychiatrist Dr.Rachel Malamed; board-certified veterinary behavioristDr. Stefanie Schwartz, owner ofPet Behavior Medicineand founder ofCivilized Pet; and certified professional dog trainer Rob Adams, owner ofFRONT DOG Trainingand designer of the FRONT Harness.\n“It’s hard for us to know what dogs are thinking and feeling because they can’t tell us,” Schwartz says. “All we can do is make educated guesses about what we think they’re feeling based on their behavior.”\nInterrupting their sleep\nYou know those moments when you look over and yourdog is shaking, twitching, and chirping?Don’t wake them up. Just like you hate it when someone comes between you and your REM cycle, so does your dog. As intense as thosesleepy-time behaviorsmight look, they’re perfectly normal 99.9 percent of the time.\nGenerally, Schwartz says, it’s best not toproject onto our dogsand assume that they will react to things the way we do. At the same time, there is some common ground to be found, and this is one example. “When my kids woke me up on Sunday morning at 5 a.m. I wasn’t all that grateful,” she says. Your dog wouldn’t be, either.\nPracticing “exposure therapy”\nWhen your dog is afraid of something, it can be tempting to use the “sink or swim” method. But just like those stereotypical boomer parents who threw their kids into the family pool, dog parents who do this often set their beloved pals up for further trauma.\nRepeatedly exposing dogs to situations that have sparked fearful or aggressive reactions in the past is not ideal, Malamed says. “Often, thisworsens their fear, anxiety or stress.” Instead, she recommends a more gradual and systematic approach; build up exposure gradually to avoid a fearful response.\nUltimately, repeated and forced exposure to frightening stimuli can diminish trust, increase your dog’s fear, and even increase the risk that your dog will react aggressivelyor bite. In fact, Malamed says, “I have had numerous clients come to see me after suffering bites as a direct effect of using punitive and confrontational techniques that caused their dog’s issues to worsen.”\nEnding walks early\nWe’re all busy, but for many dogs, especially city dwellers, walks are acrucial enrichment time— their only chance to explore and engage with the outside world. Unless your dog hasspecific anxietiesaround going outside, chances are they hate it when you spend the entire walk rushing them along.\n“Walks are a huge deal,” Schwartz says. To your dog, this is a territorial patrol of the neighborhood — a form of exercise and intellectual stimulation and also abonding opportunityas their pack secures the perimeter. “So, if you deprive your dog of a walk or shorten it for your own reasons, then you're depriving the dog of some massively important benefits that affect their health and their mental health.”\nThe other thing about walks? They’re also good for your health. So, do both yourself and your dog a favor and see them through to the end.\nScolding them instead of modeling good behavior\nA poorly trained dog hears the word “no” a lot more than necessary— and more often than not, because of poorly trained humans. If you really want to exist harmoniously with your dog, it’s important to show them what youdowant them to do instead of just telling themnotto do something.\nDogs don’t discern between positive and negative attention, Adams says: “If the only attention they get is while they’re doing something you don’t want, you’re accidentally teaching them to do that.”\nThis is wheretraining techniques, like redirection, can be key. For example, if your dog is barking, don’t just shout “no” and call it a day. Try to redirect their energy into checking in with you or playing with a toy. Then, provide occasional rewards when they exhibit the new behavior you want.\nBugging them during mealtime\nDogs only eat a couple times per day, and for many, this is a sacred moment. To let your dog fully savor their grub, avoid petting, prodding, or playing with them until they’ve scarfed it all down. And definitely don’t take the food away once it’s hit the ground.\nBehaviors like those described above can “trigger an immediate response of displeasure,” Schwartz warns, “and some dogs can then have that pathway switched on and become verydefensive of their foodor toys or treats — whatever it is that we have taken away from them.”\nLetting strangers approach without warning\nPicture this: You’re sitting with friends in the park, and all of a sudden, a random interloper runs up to you, starts making weird noises at you, and reaches out to scratch your forehead. You try to back away, but instead of taking the hint, he comes closer while all of your friends stare and let it happen. If that doesn’t sound ideal to you, why let it happen to your dog?\n“Humans tend to greet dogs head-on, reach to pet them, make direct eye contact, and immediately assume thatthey want to be pet,” Malamed says. But just like you probably wouldn’t appreciate this kind of greeting, neither does your dog. Instead, Malamed says, many dogs can find the experience “threatening.”\nShort changing them during playtime\nA lot of people tend to treat their dogs like objects in a room — unconscious things that are just kind of there. But as Adams puts it, “They’re not lamps.” They’re living, breathing, conscious beings, and if we don’t give them something interesting to do, they’ll spend most of their lives bored.\n“They’re very social creatures,” Adams says. “Your dog doesn’t like it when you’re staring at your phone when they’re staring at you.”\nSimilarly, Schwartz says, another commonfaux pasis initiating play and then failing to follow through. “That’s kind of selfish, right?” she says. “So give your dog the time, make the time that they need, and don’t walk away until they’re done and happy.”\nCoddling them\nThis one’s for those of us with small dogs. As tempting as it might be to treat your pint-sized pooch like something between an infant and a toy, you’re actually stifling their development. Dogs need to build confidence, and they do that by interacting with the world on their own — not by riding around in your purse or sitting on your lap 24/7.\nSome pet parents skip training their smaller dogs, Adams notes, because they believe only big dogs need it. That couldn’t be further from the truth. He uses Chihuahuas’ stereotypical penchant for barking as an example: “Everyone thinks they’re always very yappy, and that’s because nobody trains them,” he says. “They don’t know what they're supposed to be doing, so they freak out.”\nWhile some little dogs like being picked up and sitting on laps (as do some large dogs), every dog is different. Before you snatch a fluffy little dog into our arms, approach slowly and make sure they’re interested in interacting that way. Even if they do enjoy being held, make sure you give them enough opportunities to investigate their surroundings on their own.\n“They never build up confidence if they aren’t allowed to do what is natural to them,” Adams says. “If you coddle a child, they don’t know how to be OK on their own.” Dogs are no different.\nIgnoring their body language\nDogs can’t use their words to tell us when they’re upset, and too often, we ignore the many,many cuesandvocalizations they useto communicate instead. If you want to understand better and avoid getting on their nerves in the future, you have to learn to read their signals.\n“Look at the whole body and the big picture, as well as the subtle signs of canine body language,” Malamed says. “For example: ears back,lip-licking, yawning, tail down, moving away, avoiding eye contact can indicate fear,anxiety or stress.”\nWhile many pet parents might complain about their dogs lashing out orbecoming aggressive“out of nowhere,” as Adams put it, there actually tend to be a lot of warning signs. Per Adams, “Reading the dog’s body language is really important to understanding the dog.”\nForced crate-training\n“To crate, ornot to crate?” That is the question most dog parents will ask at some point or another. While some experts advise that cratescan be  a safe spacefor your pup (especially if youfind the right oneand train them early), Schwartz says this is not the case for all dogs. She adds that alternatives exist — for example, play pens and baby gates, which offer more space and may feel less confining to your particular dog.\n“Dogs are very much individuals, and some of them do well and even like going into their crates just to hang out,” Schwartz says. “But the vast majority of dogs are not going to think it’s OK.”\nTalking at them like people\nAs instinctual as it might feel to beg your dog not to pee on forbidden objects during a walk, you might as well be amwop-mwop-mwop-ing adult in aPeanutscartoon. “Dogs will pick up like 250 to 1000 words that we use,” Adams says. “But everything is action-based. It’s the association with the words that matters.”\nIf you spend too much timespewing meaningless soundsat your dog, Adams warns, they might start to tune you out. Instead, use body language to communicate your excitement and displeasure. Your dog (and pretty much every other animal in the world) will understand that a lot better.",

  },
  "page_content": "Belly rubs, scratches (or “scritches” if you’re using the cutesy pet-parent vernacular) behind the ears, chin stokes — dogs have all sorts of sweet spots where theylike to receive pets. But the deep, satisfying booty scratch in particular seems to overshadow the rest. That begs the question: Why, of all possible places, are dogs obsessed with getting scratches on their butts? While scientific research on this specific phenomenon is limited, experts have some educated guesses.\nKinship spoke with Lauren Fox, the executive director of All Breed Rescue and Training atHave a Nice Dog, and Lydia Rakov, the co-owner, chief training officer, and behavior consultant atGood Dog, Dyno, about why dogs might love butt rubs. Here’s what they said.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nIt itches a scratch in a hard-to-reach place.\nTheir heads, ears, chests — these are all easy spots for dogs to reach and scratch solo. But for many dogs, especially longer-bodied breeds like Dachshunds, the rear end is simply hard to get to access.\n“It’s like that same spot on your back that you just can’t reach,” Fox says. As a result, some dogs might like butt rubs because it’s a place they can’t get to without a little help.\nBooty scratches just feel good.\nIt’s as simple as that. Rakov says that a dog’s rear end, especially near the base of the tail, usually has an abundance of nerve endings, which would make scratches there extra satisfying.\nShe also notes that the shape of your nails might be better than your dog’s at providing deep scratches that get down to the skin level, especially for double-coated dog breeds like Border Collies or Pomeranians. “I think it’s relatable,” Fox adds. “You could scratch your own back, but it always feels better when somebody else does it.”\nIt’s conditioned reinforcement.\nRakov says that butt rubs might be apositive reinforcement mechanismfor some dogs. For example, in her time training dogs, she says some will respond positively to a high-value treat likehot dogs, someto praise, and some to pets and booty scratches. Your pup might love getting butt scratches because it’s associated with a job well done. Whatever works!\nIt’s a non-threatening way to interact.\nDogs rely heavilyon body languageas a form of communication. In this context, Fox says dogs might use butt rubs as a less threatening, less vulnerable way to ask for and receive pets. She says that front interactions, such as face-to-face or chest-to-chest, can feel inappropriate or intimidating for dogs. Offering their booties, however, can feel like a safer, more cautious option.\nIf you look for it, you’ll probably see this “booty language” frequently. Dogssniff each others’ buttsin greeting, and many practice what Fox calls “butt-fu,” or playing by jostling each other with their butts.\nWhen butt rubs aren’t a good thing.\nIf your dog asks for booty rubs, that’s usually a sign that your dog is comfortable. However, there are some exceptions. Rakov says that sometimes pet parents mistake anal swiping for a request for butt rubs. She describes this behavior (not going to repeat it) as a “really rude” practice where a dog will essentially quickly rub their butt on you to mark you as their territory. She adds that dogswithout a lot of socializationmay do this when they’re uncomfortable.\nIt’s also important to keep track of any instance in which your dog shies away from butt pets. Both Rakov and Fox caution that a dog who expresses discomfort when you pet their lower back, hip, or rear — especially if they normally like pets in these areas — may do so becausethey’re experiencing pain. If you notice this, it’s worth checking in with your vet.\nHow to know if a dog wants booty scritches\nWhen it comes to booty scritches, it’s all about knowing what your dog prefers andrespecting their boundaries. “You’re going to have some people who love to be hugged, but then you’re going to have some people who are really averse to hugs,” Rakov says. “Dogs as individuals, they’re going to be that way as well.”\nTo see if a dog is receptive to some butt rubs, or even pets in general, follow this approach:\nCheck with the dog for consent:Turn to the side and hold your hand palm-up on your leg (don’t stick yourhand in the dog’s face). Wait to see if they approach you.\nCheck with the dog for consent:Turn to the side and hold your hand palm-up on your leg (don’t stick yourhand in the dog’s face). Wait to see if they approach you.\nDo a test pet:If the dog comes up to sniff orlick your hand, it’s usually OK to do a “test pet.” Fox says dogs will often position themselves where they’d like to receive physical touch, but if you’re unsure, aim for a neutral area like the chest. Rakov recommends following the “Rule of Three”: Give one three-second pet or three short, one-second pets.\nDo a test pet:If the dog comes up to sniff orlick your hand, it’s usually OK to do a “test pet.” Fox says dogs will often position themselves where they’d like to receive physical touch, but if you’re unsure, aim for a neutral area like the chest.

If they leave, that means they’re done with the interaction.\nIf a dog really appreciates their booty scratch session, they may give you what Fox calls “flea-biting,” which are tiny nibbles to your hands or clothing. Fox says these aren’t unhappy or threatening bites but a sign of endearment and enjoyment.\nWhether it’s the booty,the belly, behind the ears, or the chin, pay close attention to where (and when and how long) your dog wants pets to make sure they’re having the best experience.\n“Anytime that you are conscious of your body language and conscious of your dog’s body language, you arebuilding a relationship of trust and cooperation, and strengthening the bond that you have and the trust that they have in you,” Fox says.",

  },
  "page_content": "Dogs engage in numerous behaviors that are mystifying, and to humans, disgusting. For some pet parents, hand licking is one of them. Patting my dog Lilac becomes a game of keep-away if I don’t want her licking my hands, which I confess sometimes grosses me out. Learning the origin of this behavior has given me a fresh perspective. Besides, there’s always soap and water.\nDr. Aimee Warner, a veterinarian at the pet-insurance companyWaggel, describes hand-licking as something of an honor. “The hand-licking of your dog can be traced back to canid puppies,” Warner says. “These puppies in the wild are known to lick their mother’s mouth to get her to regurgitate food. When your dog licks your hands, it’s a way of showing trust and affection to you as their provider.”\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nParham Raoufi, founder ofPaws Grooming Empire, says hand licking is a way for dogs to connect and convey emotions. “Dogs frequently lick your hands due to their desire for affection, curiosity, and need for reassurance,” Raoufi says.\nWhy does my dog lick my hands?\nWarner says dogs have extremely sensitive taste buds that help them gather information, much like talking and reading. Just like a good conversation is satisfying to us, a hearty hand lick releases yourdog’s endorphins. “When they lick your hands, they’re actually getting precise chemical information about your activities and location during the day, essentially ‘reading” your day,” she says. “When they lick your hands, they show affection while also making themselves feel good.”\nParham says in the absence of verbal communication, licking is aform of self-expression. “A dog depends on scent along with flavor and skin perception to investigate the environment,” he says. “After a sniffing investigation, your dog moves on to lick you using both scent and tasting abilities to study your scent identity.”\nThe sentiment is nice, but...\nMost common reasons your dog is licking your hands\nParham says dogs typically lick your hands for three main reasons: greeting, affection, and information-seeking. Pay attention to the context of the licking, because it usually provides some clue as to its meaning. “Knowing these subtleties will enable you to better understand what your dog is attempting to convey through this behavior,” Warner says.\nThis is the primary reason your dog licks your hands. Warner says occasional licks during periods of relaxation signify affection.\nOpening the door to wiggles and tail-wagging is one of the best parts of being a dog parent. Licking your hands is just another way for your dog to greet you.\nRepetitive licking and pawing can signal an underlying issue.\nLicking is a way for dogs to soothe themselves. “More licking on the occasion of thunderstorms or fireworks displaysindicates nervousness,” Warner says.\nParham points to increased licking as a possible sign of allergies, injuries, or joint pain. When this becomes obsessive or leads toskin irritation, it’s time to call the vet.\nThose taste buds on a dog’s tongue aresensitive. With that in mind, Warner says your hands might be telling your dog an interesting story.\nTheir toes might smell like Fritos, but there’s no way they tastethatgood.\nWhen is your dog licking your hands a problem?\nParham says a certain amount of licking is common behavior, but if the licking increases rapidly, this may indicate health problems. “Dogs tend to lick frequently when they experience symptoms of anxiety, stress, or appear unwell,” he says. “Frequent licking in dogs sometimes develops when they have allergies, injuries, or joint pain.”\nOther problem signs to watch out for include hand-licking disrupting their daily routine, causing skin irritation (for you or the dog), or when it’s followed by other undesired behaviors such as pacing, whining, or destructiveness. It’s also telling when your dog protests when you try to stop them from licking.\nHow to stop your dog from licking your hands excessively\nExperts agreethat redirection, positive reinforcement, and exercise all help reduce excessive hand-licking. Since licking is an inherent behavior for dogs, it’s difficult to stop it entirely, Parham says. But by employing the following strategies, you can manage excessive licking.\nRedirect your dog’s attention by giving them chew toys, food puzzles, or teaching them new tricks that require sitting or paw movements.\nRedirect your dog’s attention by giving them chew toys, food puzzles, or teaching them new tricks that require sitting or paw movements.\nActive dogs tend to lick less often.

Also, employ consistent verbal cues. “Teach ‘no lick’ or an equivalent command, rewarding them when they [stop licking].”\nWhen your dog isn’t licking, engage in positive reinforcement training with a reward. Since a tired dog is a calm dog, make sure your dog is getting plenty of exercise and mental stimulation. If the licking appears to be anxiety-induced, identify and remove the cause of anxiety. In the case of a thunderstorm or unavoidable loud noises in the vicinity, ease your dog’s urge to lick your hands by redirecting them.\nThen there’s the obvious: “Wash hands thoroughly,” Warner says. “Eliminate food odors that are possibly enticing them.”\nKeep in mind that some licking is perfectly normal and even healthy bonding behavior. “It’s only when it gets out of hand that you’ll need to take action,” Warner says. “If the behavior recurs or appears to be compulsive, consult with your veterinarian or a professional animal behaviorist.”\nFAQs\nLicking is normal behavior. Dogs lick our hands to show affection, self-soothe, and investigate what we’ve been eating.\nYou can train your dog not to lick your hands, and by understanding why dogs lick our hands (read the full guide, above), maybe take some of the “ick” out of “lick.”\nYes, obsessive licking may signify anxiety, boredom, allergies, pain, or injury.\nHealth-wise, hand-licking is generally safe. However, dog saliva does contain bacteria, so it’s best to wash your hands after your dog has licked them, particularly if you’re immune-compromised or about to prepare food.\nTry redirecting both of them by asking them to sit calmly for a few seconds and rewarding them when they do.",

    "title": "Does Your Dog Want Their Collar Taken off When They Get Home?",

  },
  "page_content": "If you wear a bra, you know the unmatched relief of coming home after a long day and finally —finally— being able to relieve yourself of its rigid torso prison. Truly, there is no feeling better than being able to take your first uninhibited breath for the first time all day, OK? If you have a dog, you may have watched them snoozing in their collar and wondered if they might be yearning for the same kind of relief. Is a collar kind of like — and stay with me here — a dog’s uncomfortable bra? Or is it a more negligible accessory, like a little ring or a watch?\nWe asked experts to tell us how dogs really feel about their collars, whether they need a periodic break from wearing them, and if constant wear could do more harm than good.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nDo dogs mind wearing a collar?\nFirst, we should define the type of collar we’re talking about. Obviously, any collar used inaversive trainingis extremely painful— that means prong collars, shock collars (also known as e-collars), or choke collars. Kinship is strongly against the use of these kinds of collars, to be clear.\nHead haltis, aka “head halters” or “gentle leaders,” which are structurally similar to a horse’s collar, can also cause injuries. “Dogs’ necks are not built like a horse’s and can easily be damaged by an owner pulling too hard in one direction,” trainer Charlie DiBonotold Kinship. So, let’s narrow our focus to flat collars, the standard sort of collar that typically features a D-ring on which you canhang an ID tag. Are our dogs comfortable while wearing them?\n“Yes, most dogs are fairly comfortable wearing collars,”Dr. Carly Fox, senior veterinarian at the Schwarzman Animal Medical Center, tells Kinship. “Much like how most people feel comfortable wearing a light necklace.”\nDr. Brian Collins, a veterinarian with the Cornell Riney Canine Health Center, agrees. “Most of the time, it appears that dogs adapt to their collar and don’t necessarily notice it anymore — like a ring, a watch, or even clothing,” he says.\nFox adds that it’s important that the collar fits correctly and not be too tight or too loose. “Ideally, you should be able to fit two fingers under the collar when on,” she says. She adds that it should also be light, flexible, and dry easily: “Collars that are heavy, metal, or rigid can be uncomfortable.”\nHow can you tell if your dog dislikes their collar?\nIf your dog doesn’t like a collar, they probably won’t be shy about letting you know. “The dog will try to remove the collar with their paws, scratch at the area, or even be sensitive to touch,” Fox says. They might also rub their next on the ground, or on a piece of furniture. “If you tug at their collar, and they yelp or cry in discomfort, these dogs should be in a harness.”\nAre there risks associated with wearing a collar full-time?\n“If the collar fits your dog correctly, there is little risk to leaving it on all the time,” Fox says. Still, it’s important to be mindful of potential hazards. Collins points out that collars can get caught on various things like crates, furniture, tree limbs, or fences. “Another serious risk is for dogs who wrestle with each other,” he says. “One dog can get their teeth caught under the collar of another dog, which could cause strangulation.” A dog could even get their own foot or lower teeth caught under their collar if it’s too loose, so again, make sure it fits properly.\nFox says if you want to remove the collar while at home, you should feel free to do so, just make sure that your dog has an alternative form of identification,like a microchip— particularly if they’re an escape-artist type. And remember to put the collar back on for walks or if they go out in the yard. She also notes that forincredibly active pets, like cats, “you can use a breakaway collar to avoid any accidental choking or injury if the collar gets caught on something at home.”\nWhile a properly fitted collar is unlikely to cause harm during daily wear, certain situations can increase the risk of injury. Collars can lead to neck strain when your dog is pulling or lunging when on leash, Collins says. In that case, he advises that pet parents use aharness to walk their dogs.\nFox says harnesses should also be used for breeds that are predisposed to cervical disc disease (IVDD), like Dachshunds and Beagles. “The same goes for anybrachycephalic breed[like Bulldogs, Pugs, and Pekingese] as pressure on their neck can result in respiratory distress.” Greyhound breeds have thin skin and thick necks, so traditional collars can be uncomfortable for them (and easy to slip out of), too. “Ideally, they should wear a special martingale collar for this reason,” Fox says.Martingale collars, also called limited slip collars, feature two loops that keep a pup secured but won’t choke them. For this reason, rescue workers and professional dog walkers prefer this kind of collar.\n“There are potentially even worse consequences if a dog is tied out in the yard and runs to the end of the rope/chain and causes sudden forceful pressure on the neck,” Collins says. “Pressure on the neck can injure the spinal cord, the trachea, or other soft-tissue structures in the neck, such as nerves and blood vessels.”\nCan collars lead to skin issues?\nFor some dogs, constant collar wear can lead to skinproblems like hair loss, which is mainly an undesired cosmetic result. “They can also cause skin irritation and infection, especially with long-haired dogs, dogs with a lot of skin folds, as well as dogs who swim a lot or who have underlying allergies that affect their skin,” Collins says. Fox adds that any dog who has underlying atopy or askin diseasecan develop irritation under and around their collar. Make sure to monitor your pup’s skin and talk to your vet about alternative solutions if irritation develops.\nShould we take our dog’s collar off for sleep?\nOf course, it would be ideal if we could simplyaskour dogs about what their preference is: collar on or off atbedtime? In lieu of that, Collins took his best educated guess. “Even though your dog gets used to their collar and doesn’t seem to even notice that it is there anymore,” he says. “I do think they seem to enjoy getting a break from it at night or anytime you are relaxing around the house together.”",

  "page_content": "Have you ever watched your dog grab a mouthful of kibble, trot over to the carpet, drop it, and eat it one piece at a time? It’s common, sometimes frustrating (and messy) behavior that leaves pet parents confused. Why do dogs insist on dining in a different spot when they have a perfect food bowl? As odd as it may seem, this habit is rooted ina pup’s instincts, environment, and personal preferences.\nWhen your dog brings food to the carpet to eat, they aren’t doing it to be a nuisance. They’re following behaviors passed down from wild ancestors or reacting to their surroundings. Whether they are trying to protect their meal, avoid an uncomfortable (or unclean) bowl, or prefer the texture of the carpet under their paws, there’s a logical reason behind the habit.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThey seem to be bottomless pits, but something has to to tell them when to stop... right?\nIs it normal for dogs to take their food elsewhere to eat it?\nAbsolutely. Many dogs exhibit this behavior; in most cases, it’s normal, and there’s nothing to worry about. While some pups are content to gobble their meals straight from their bowl, others must relocate their food to eat it. This instinctual habit can be traced to their wolf ancestors, who often moved their food to safer locations to avoid annoyances or competition.\nIt may be worth investigating if your dog suddenly starts moving their food when they never did before or if they seem stressed while eating. Changes in behavior can indicate underlying issues that need attention.\nWhy dogs take their food to another room\nDogs may move their food to another room for various reasons, including instinct, comfort, and environmental factors, like noise or other animals. Somedogs feel safereating in a quieter, more secluded place, while others have ingrained survival instincts to protect their meals from potential threats (other dogs or animals), even where there’s no one around. In some cases, the location of their food bowl may be uncomfortable, whether due to height, noise, foot traffic, or the texture of the floor beneath it.\n5 common reasons your dog brings their food to the carpet to eat\nEven if your dog is the only pet in the house, their instincts may tell them to protect their food. Dogs and wolves had toguard mealsfrom others in the pack in the wild. Moving their food to another room (or a few feet away from their bowl) may be their way of ensuring no invisible competitor sneaks in for a bite.\nAccording to Dr. Gary Richter, a veterinary health expert in Oakland, California, “Even though a domestic dog may not be in danger when eating, instincts can override everything else.”\nSome dogs stash food for later, a habit leftover from their survival instincts. If they move their food to the carpet, they might treat the rug like a safe place to “store” their meal for later. If you notice yourdog burying foodunder blankets or furniture or trying to nudge it under the rug, they could be in full-on hoarding mode.\nThe problem may not be the food but the bowl itself. Some dogs dislike metal bowls because they’re reflective and make clanking sounds when their tags hit them. Others may find deep bowls uncomfortable for their snouts. If your dog prefers the carpet over their bowl, try using a different type of dish to see if that makes a difference.\nNot all dogs are social eaters. Some prefer quiet while they enjoy their meal. If their food bowl is placed in a high-traffic area, like the kitchen or near other pets, they may feel more comfortable carrying their food elsewhere, such as a cozy, carpeted spot where they won’t be disturbed.\nDogs in the wild often drag food away from the main feeding area to avoid conflict. This behavior can carry over to domestic life, even if they don’t have competition for their meal. Your dog may be following an instinctual urge to move their food to a safer location (and it might be your favorite rug).\nHow to train your dog not to eat food on the carpet\nThere are a few things you can do to train your dog not to eat food on the carpet, including:\nMove your dog’s bowl to a quieter area.If your dog prefers eating in a different room, try relocating their food bowl to a less busy spot.\nMove your dog’s bowl to a quieter area.If your dog prefers eating in a different room, try relocating their food bowl to a less busy spot.\nUse a feeding mat.A non-slip, washable mat can create a designated eating area while keeping messes contained.\nUse a feeding mat.A non-slip, washable mat can create a designated eating area while keeping messes contained.\nTry a different bowl.Some dogs dislike metal bowls due to reflections or noise, so consider switching to ceramic or silicone.\nTry a different bowl.Some dogs dislike metal bowls due to reflections or noise, so consider switching to ceramic or silicone.\nMake mealtime more engaging.Puzzle feeders or slow-feeder bowls can keep their focus on eating in one place.\nMake mealtime more engaging.Puzzle feeders or slow-feeder bowls can keep their focus on eating in one place.\nSupervise your dog’s meals.Gently guide them back to their bowl if they try to carry food to the carpet.

Reduce portions to ensure they feel comfortable.\nWhen to consult a professional for eating food in another room\nIn most cases, a dog taking food to another room is harmless, but sometimes, it signals an issue that needs attention. If your dog suddenly starts relocating their food, seems anxious while eating, or refuses to eat unless they move their food, then consult a veterinarian. Dental pain, digestive discomfort, orstress-related behaviorscould be the underlying problem.\nAdditionally, if your dog exhibits extreme guarding behavior, like growling, snapping, or acting defensive around their food, you should seek help from a professional trainer or behaviorist.\nA vet’s-eye-view of an all-too-common problem.\nBottom line\nYour dog’s mealtime habits are (usually) driven by instinct, personal comfort, or environmental factors. They may be trying to find a quiet place to eat, avoiding an uncomfortable bowl, or following a natural urge to protect their food.\nThe bottom line is that this behavior shouldn't be concerning if your dog is healthy and happy. However, if it’s creating a mess or signaling anxiety, minor adjustments, like a feeding mat or moving their bowl, can help. If the behavior suddenly changes, it's wise to check with a vet or trainer.\nFAQs\nMany dogs instinctively move food to a quieter, safer spot. They may dislike their bowl, find the floor too slippery, or prefer eating alone.\nYour dog may feel more comfortable eating near you. They could also prefer carpeted surfaces or instinctively move food away to protect it.\nSome dogs dislike eating from bowls, prefer foraging, or find it more comfortable to eat from the floor due to sensitive whiskers or bowl noises.\nIt’s usually harmless but can be messy. If it’s a sudden change, check for discomfort, anxiety, or bowl issues. Adjust feeding routines if necessary.\nReferences\nRichter, Gary. “Why Do Dogs Bring Their Food Somewhere Else to Eat It?”Reader’s Digest,https://www.rd.com/article/why-dogs-bring-their-food-somewhere-else-to-eat-it/\nRichter, Gary. “Why Do Dogs Bring Their Food Somewhere Else to Eat It?”Reader’s Digest,https://www.rd.com/article/why-dogs-bring-their-food-somewhere-else-to-eat-it/\nPetful. “Why Dog Carries Food Away: 6 Common Reasons.”Petful,https://www.petful.com/behaviors/why-dog-carries-food-away/\nPetful. “Why Dog Carries Food Away: 6 Common Reasons.”Petful,https://www.petful.com/behaviors/why-dog-carries-food-away/\nWag! “Why Do Dogs Put Food on Carpet?”WagWalking,https://wagwalking.com/behavior/why-do-dogs-put-food-on-carpet\nWag! “Why Do Dogs Put Food on Carpet?”WagWalking,https://wagwalking.com/behavior/why-do-dogs-put-food-on-carpet\nVetstreet. “Why Does My Dog… Eat His Food Away from His Bowl?”Vetstreet,https://www.vetstreet.com/our-pet-experts/why-does-my-dog-eat-his-food-away-from-his-bowl\nVetstreet. “Why Does My Dog… Eat His Food Away from His Bowl?”Vetstreet,https://www.vetstreet.com/our-pet-experts/why-does-my-dog-eat-his-food-away-from-his-bowl",

  "page_content": "The moment you leave for vacation, theguilt sets in. Not only are you waiting at the airport gate missing your dog, but your dog is backhome with their sitter(a stranger, basically!), sobbing into their dinner bowl and wondering how you could possibly have abandoned them after they’ve beenso good. Anangel, really.\nAt least that’s the dramatic scenario that plays out in your head — and, let’s face it, the one that most pet parents probably imagine. (Although, let’s be clear, we know our audience is full of the kind of pet parents whocarefully vet their pet sitters.) But the real question is: Do our dogs actually miss us, or is it all a human construct, and we should calm down?\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nHow do dogs experience time?\nFirst, it’s important to note that dogs don’t experience time like people do, and this affects whether they know how long we’ve been gone. Obviously, they can’t tap their iPhone to see how long it’s been since you left, so they have to do the next best thing. “They have a very good sense of smell,” says dog trainerTerry Lynn Cuyler. “Your scent fades over time, and this is how they can sense how long you have been away.” In other words, theycan smell time.\nSo, your pup can tell that your scent has started to dissipate, and that will give them a sense of whether you’ve been away 20 minutes or 20 hours. Our pups can also respond to other clues that time has passed, such as sunlight and noises outside, like people driving home from work or birds chirping in the morning.\n“Dogs are excellent at understanding contextual cues and joining the dots of what is happening in their environment,” trainerPetrina Firthchimes in. “This is why typically people tend to think their dog knows they are coming before someone actually arrives home or when dinnertime is.”\nDo dogs miss us?\nBecause our dogs have a sense of how long we’ve been gone, logic would suggest that they are sad that we are away for long periods of time.\n“If we allow for the fact that they’re sentient beings and that they have complex emotional lives, there will obviously be some similarities on how a dog might experience the person that they’re bonded to being absent,” trainerMatt Beisnersays. But, he notes, it’s not quite so simple.\nAsdog-cognition expert Alexandra Horowitztoldthis TikToker, we tend to anthropomorphize our dogs’ behavior, or in other words, attribute human characteristics to our pets.\n“The anthropomorphization and concept of ‘missing us’ may be more of a humanization of how we think dogs feel when separated from us,” Firth says. “Missing someone suggests a contemplative state and is perhaps an oversimplification when talking aboutseparation-related behavior.”\nThat kind of thinking doesn’t help us to necessarily understand our dogs and their needs better either.\n“Humans brood over memories, count the hours, and grow lonely from time to time. Dogs live in the moment,” Cuyler says. “They don’t sit and reflect on that great walk last Sunday. But that is not to say they don’t miss us. They do notice changes in routine, surroundings, and most of all, the feeling of security.”\nThat’s why it’s so important to make sure you trust the person who’s watching your dog while you’re away (or, if you’re gone only a few hours, to make sure your dog has everything they need while you’re out).\nAs dog behavior consultant Daniel Nealetold Kinshiplast year: “Don’t worry about them missing you too much, as long as they are having their needs met and they’re comfortable.” He added that dogs’ needs are much more immediate and that “it’s less likely that your dog is going to miss you [in the way you miss them].”\nYou can help your pup feel safe when you’re gone.\nThat’s not to say your dog won’t notice your absence (as anyone whose dog has experiencedseparation anxietycan attest). “Dogs can feel huge emotional pain when separated. Some dogs feel intense panic or anxiety and others a huge amount of frustration and anger,” Firth says, noting that these separation problems are typically due to unmet psychological needs or a lack of human interaction.\nBeisner makes sure that he lets his Blue Nose Pit Bull know she’s safe before he leaves. “Deja Blue is what we would call ananxious dog,” he says. “She’s really sensitive, so I go spend time with her, and at this point, it’s probably not more than 20 to 30 seconds, but she likes abelly rub. I just look for opportunities to connect with her. I look for changes in her body language that tell me that her heart rate is slowing down, her breathing is slowing down, and she’s in a better frame of mind when I leave.”\nFirth stresses that keeping your dog’s routine as normal as possible can help them feel comfortable while you’re away. “However, for many dogs, extended absences can often equal a larger disruption in routines and understanding of predictable schedules, which can make the dog more anxious as their world keeps changing,” she adds.\nIf your pup is having trouble with separation anxiety — or with handling your absence during vacations, for example — it’s smart to work with your veterinarian or apositive-reinforcement traineror behaviorist. These people can help your dog live their best life, even on the days when you’re not right there with them.\nEvery dog is different.\nThe extent to which your dog “misses” you might also depend on the individual animal. “I’ve encountered dogs that don’t bat an eye when their owner leaves and others that howl at the door the second they’re alone,” Cuyler notes.\n“They’ll have their own unique emotional experience,” Beisner says. “For a Pit Bull family, when we come home, we get the wiggles, you know? My Terrier used to give me the hops; my Husky wouldhowl at me.”\nAnd the more secure a dog is in their environment, the less they might be bummed in your absence (and that’s a good thing). Beisner points out that it could be a positive sign if your pup doesn’t run to the door when you arrive home; it suggests that they were comfortable enough without you there.\n“Dogs that are used to structure and confidence-building exercises handle separation so much better than dogs that are unsure of their surroundings,” Cuyler adds. “This is why training is not just about teaching ‘sit’ and ‘stay.’ It’s about building trust, comfort, and astrong bond, so even when you're not there, your dog will know everything is OK.”\nBeisner echoes that.\n“We’re starting to talk more and more about a dog being resilient [in the behavior world], and that’s not because we’re trying to make life hard on them, but we want them to be able to feel more resilient in this modern world, which is so challenging,” he says.\nSo, what’s the final verdict?\nDo our dogs really miss us? “Not necessarily in the same way that we do,” Cuyler says. “But when they see us walk through that door, their joy is 100 percent real. And that’s even better.”\nWhat’s more, it’s essential to always be sensitive to their needs and find ways to make sure they feel safe, even when we’re not there to keep an eye on them.\n“It’s worth remembering that from an evolutionary perspective, we designed dogs to want to hang out with us, and be with us,” Firth says. “For some breeds, we explicitly designed them as companion dogs, so their neediness and ‘missing us’ is an adaptation we selected for.”",

    "title": "5 Reasons Why Dogs Yawn",

  },
  "page_content": "Have you ever noticed your dog letting out a long, exaggerated yawn and wondered if they’re tired or if something else is happening? While humans primarily yawn because they’re bored or sleepy, dogs yawn for various reasons, most of which have nothing to do with fatigue. Some dogs may yawn as a form of communication or stress relief, while others yawn as a quirky way to mimic and bond with their humans.\nLet’s break down the five reasons dogs yawn and what those yawns may mean.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nReasons aside, it’s pretty darn cute.\nDo dogs yawn for the same reason as humans?\nNot exactly. While humans yawn mainly due to exhaustion or boredom (or sometimes lack of oxygen flow to the brain),dogs yawnfor a broader range of reasons, including as a subtle way of expressing their feelings. Whether it’s a calming gesture, a sign of excitement, or a response to your yawning, a dog’s yawn carries more meaning than sleepiness.\nWhy do dogs yawn?\nYawning is a form of nonverbal communication in dogs that can indicate stress, social engagement, or relaxation. Dogs use this behavior to interact with humans and other animals. While a tired dog might yawn before curling up for a nap, anervous dogmay yawn to calm themselves in overwhelming situations. Some dogs yawn in response to their pet parents, showing they are tuned into human emotions.\nUnderstanding why your dog yawns requires looking at context, body language, and what’s happening around them.\n5 reasons why dogs yawn\nYawning is a commonstress signal in dogs, often seen when they feel uneasy or overstimulated. If your dog yawns repeatedly at the veterinarian, during thunderstorms, or when meeting new people, they may be trying to self-soothe. Dogs use yawning to release tension, like how humans take deep breaths when anxious.\nTurid Rugaas, a renowned dog trainer and canine behaviorist from Norway, says, “Dogs often yawn as a calming signal to communicate peaceful intentions or diffuse potential conflicts.” If your dog yawns frequently in a high-stress environment, they may need reassurance or space to escape a stressful situation.\nA yawn can also be your dog’s way of showing disinterest or boredom. If your dog yawns while you’re talking to them, during an uneventful car ride, or when they’re being ignored, it could be their way of disengaging from the moment.\nThistype of yawningis accompanied by a relaxed posture or slow, drawn-out movements, like stretching, signaling disinterest rather than distress. If your pup seems bored often, try increasing their physical and mental stimulation with playtime and interactive toys or puzzles.\nYes, sometimes a yawn means your dog is sleepy. If they yawn before settling down for a nap or after a long walk, it’s likely their way of winding down. Yawning increases oxygen intake and may help dogs regulate their energy levels.\nPuppies, particularly, yawn frequently before sleep, just like human babies. If your dog’s yawns are tied to their regular rest patterns, there’s no need for concern — it’s simply part of their natural rhythm.\nHave you ever yawned in front of your dog and caught them yawning back? That’s no coincidence. Dogs experience contagious yawning (just like humans) and are more likely to “catch” a yawn from someone they are bonded with. Research has shown that dogs yawn more when they see their pet parent yawn because of an empathetic connection. So, if your dog mimics your yawns, it’s a sign of affection and bonding, signaling that they’re attuned to you and your emotions.\nExcessive yawningcan sometimes indicate an underlying health problem, particularly if other unusual behaviors accompany it. Dogs experiencing discomfort from nausea, ear infections, or dental pain may frequently yawn in response to discomfort.\nIf your dog suddenly starts yawning excessively, drooling, acting lethargic, or having difficulty eating, a vet visit is recommended to rule out potential medical concerns.\nHow to interpret your dog’s yawning\nThe meaning behind your dog’s yawn depends on when and where it happens. Here’s how to decode their yawns based on context:\nYawning before sleep or after exercise means they’re likely tired or winding down.\nYawning before sleep or after exercise means they’re likely tired or winding down.\nYawning in a stressful setting (vet visits, car rides, new environments) is likely a sign of anxiety or unease.\nYawning in a stressful setting (vet visits, car rides, new environments) is likely a sign of anxiety or unease.\nYawning while interacting with you could indicate mild boredom, disengagement, or even a calming signal.\nYawning while interacting with you could indicate mild boredom, disengagement, or even a calming signal.\nYawning right after you yawn could be a sign of social mirroring and bonding.\nYawning right after you yawn could be a sign of social mirroring and bonding.\nFrequent yawningwith other signs of distress (drooling, panting, excessive licking) could indicate a potential health issue.

  "page_content": "As pet parents, we want to do everything in our power to ensure that our little familiars are happy and healthy. We agonize over which food to buy, take them on as many outdoor adventures as possible, and squeak every toy at the pet store to see which one our babies might like best. But how do we know if our dogs are happy — you know, like,reallyhappy?\nIt’s easy to tell with humans. Are we smiling? Jumping up and down? Do we have a nice, big ice cream cone in our hands? All signs point to elation. With dogs, however, it’s a little more complicated. We all know to look for a wagging tail, but in reality, canine communication is a lot more sophisticated than that. (And actually, depending onhowyour dog is wagging their tail, that, too, could indicate a problem.)\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nTo know if your dog is truly satisfied with their life, or even just this afternoon, you need a more nuanced frame of reference.\nAccording to Dr. Alison Gerken,veterinary behavioristat theSan Francisco SPCA, dogs mainly use their bodies to communicate and sometimes add in vocalizations when their emotional state gets heightened. (For example: When your dog is alreadyexcited for playtime, and youtease them with a toy, they might begin to bark.)\n“When dog parents understand their dog’s communication cues,” Gerken says, “they can better determine whether the dog is content in the long term.” It doesn’t take a mind reader to know how our pets are feeling. Here are some of the clearest signals that your dog is living their best life.\nHow to know if your dog is happy\nDogs express their emotions in a variety of ways — including through their posture, facial expressions, body movements, and vocalizations like barking or chirping. Put the entire package together, and you’ll start to get a clear idea of how your best bud is feeling.\n“Interpreting a dog’s body language involves looking at each body part individually, but also considering how these parts work together in the context of the dog’s environment and past experiences,” Gerken says. To get started, check out what their whole body looks like.\nIf your dog is really chilled out, their body should look relaxed and loose, Gerken says — “much like a perfectly cooked spaghetti noodle.”Che carino!\nNext, move on tothe ears. If your dog is feeling blissful, they should be nice and floppy. On the other hand, if your dog is feelingfrightened or stressed, you might notice themtucking their earstightly against their skull. A vigilant dog might prick their ears up to better hear their surroundings and perhaps even move them around like periscopes.\nApparently, atail wagdoes not always indicate a good time. “While it can signify that a dog is happy,” Gerken says, “dogs can also wag their tails when they are stressed or about to become aggressive.” As for how to tell which is which? It’s all in the movement.\nIf your dog’s tail wag is slow and sweeping, you’re in the clear. Ditto for dogs who wag their whole rump along with their tail. That’s the kind of joy we all hope to achieve. Sometimes, perfectly satisfied dogs don’t wag their tails at all. If your dog is calm, their tail might either hang behind them or run parallel to their back.\nOn the other hand, Gerken cautions, a “stiff or quick wag, or a wag at just the tip of the tail,can indicate fear.”\nYou know those goofy,squinty eyesdogs sometimes make — the kind that inspire memes like “stoner dog?” Those are a very good sign that much like, well, a stereotypical stoner, your dog has reached a very chill plane of existence. Bonus points if your dog’s mouth is open with the corners gently lifted. Rest assured, they’re having a good time,maaan.But if your pup isn’t feeling all the peace and love and is stressed, their eyes may be rounder with dilated pupils. This look may be accompanied by a furrowed brow.\nFor clarity, this is less of a willful Gene Simmons tongue and more of a cartoon-dog tongue.\nAccording to Gerken, happy dogs might let their tongues hang loose, “giving theappearance of a smile.” By contrast, an uncomfortable dog might show you “a stiff, tightly closed mouth, possibly with the corners pulled tightly to the sides like a clown-face.”\nBarkingdoes not always signal cheerfulness, but in some situations, that’s exactly what it means. Much like the tail wagging, it depends on context and execution.\n“When dogs are happy or excited they may make high-pitched,quick barksor joyful yelps,” says Gerken. At the same time, she adds, “it’s important to remember that barking can have various meanings and express many emotions.”\nTo figure out whatkind of barkyou’re hearing, check back in with your dog’s body language and use context clues to get a better sense of what stimulus might have prompted the barking. If you see that your pup is exuberant, and you’re doing something they like, chances are they are excitedly sharing their happiness with you.\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer here. Depending on your dog’s age, breed, and temperament, their usual energy level will vary. Once you know their general baseline, you can begin to gauge whether their energy and engagement seems normal.\nA happy dog will respond to your environment in the usual ways — joining in onactivities like walks, playtime, andsocializing consistentwith their past behavior. If your dog suddenly seems more energetic than usual, frantic, or agitated, Gerken says, “this may be a sign of anxiety, while a lack of energy or a reluctance to engage in activities could suggest emotional stress or illness.”\nIf your dog seemswithdrawn or lethargicfor an extended period of time, it might be time to schedule a vet visit to make suresomething deeperisn’t going on.\nWe’ve all probably seen this at some point. From prancing before dinnertime to the hippity-hoppity greetings we sometimes get after a long day of work, this is the cutest way our dogs communicate that they are pleased. Per Gerken, “Aplay bow, where a dog lowers their chest to the ground and lifts their rear, is another classic sign of joy.”\nPut together, all of these signs can give us a good idea of how content our dogs are in the short-term. But this doesn’t necessarily answer the broader question that keepsmeup at night: Are my dogs truly happy with their lives? Gerken offers an answer that, frankly, got me feeling a little existential: “Happiness is not about always being joyful but about experiencing a healthy balance of positive emotions with fewer moments and intensity of stress or anxiety.” Ain’tthatthe truth?\nNo dog’s life is perfect, but a happy dog will engage in their day-to-day lives with enthusiasm — seizing the day (and every ball they can get their teeth on, if they’re into that sort of thing) with gusto. As should we all.",

Even the chillest person becomes someone who suddenly cares about things like dust on their baseboards or whether the throw pillows on the couch are fluffed enough.

They, too, have to make a good impression on these friends. They need attention! Love!Belly rubs! And what’s the best way to gain immediate approval from a stranger (or a friend you only see occasionally)? Give them a gift, duh.\nAs thiscute videoillustrates, some dogs love to carefully select a random household item to bring to any guests who step into the house.

She says that part of the reason for the behavior is that dogs all have different, built-in instincts.\n“They want to pick up and parade items around as a natural expression of behavior they are genetically coded for, so this is really common in dogs like Golden Retrievers,” Hewitt says.Wolves would bring foodback to their dens after hunting, and this has been passed down to many dogs, but especially Cocker Spaniels, Labradors, and other Retriever dogs.\nThey want to make you (and your friends) happy.\nIn addition to genetics, how youreactwhen your dog brings you items may encourage them to keep doing it. “Dogs that have picked up items and thenreceived positive feedback, like happiness or praise, might also repeat the behavior until it becomes a habit,” Hewitt says. She adds that if you praise your dog when they bring you different items or often playgames like fetchtogether, it’s no surprise that they want to share the magic with your guests. You’re always saying “good girl” or “good boy” when they bring you something, so when they hear the doorbell or a knock at the door, they just want to impress somebody new with their great fetching skills.\nAll dogs are different, and if you have a Chihuahua who likes to bring slippers to your visitors, that doesn’t necessarily mean they have Retriever energy. For some dogs, Hewitt says, this behavior could mean that the scent of the owner’s items acts as a “comfort blanket,” and it simply makes them feel good to carry these things around.\n“For dogs who love to play fetch, it could be a way of enticing the person to throw the item so they can play the game. This is more likely if the dog is dropping the item at your feet, as dogs who love to parade often want to show off rather than chase after,” Hewitt adds. Some dogs might have learned that when they take your belongings, they get your attention. Even negative attention is still pretty exciting for a dog who just wants you tonoticethem.\nTake heart: This habit really isn’t a problem.\nIt’s natural to wonder why your dog does basically anything. They’ve all got their own little personalities, quirks, and reasons, and we all want to get to know our sweet pals better. However, if your dog always insists on bringing your guests a gift at the door, you might be questioning whether there’s any need to worry.\nLuckily, Hewitt says there’s not really any need to panic. “I actually really like this behavior,” she says. “It channels the dog’s excitement at visitors into something much calmer, and I actively try and teach dogs who get extremely boisterous to ‘get a toy’to carry, because they are less likely to jump and bark.”\nSo, if your dog brings a present to visitors, they’re actually already doing something that professional dog trainers might encourage them to do. All that without you even trying! However, Hewitt notes, you should be a little more vigilant with dogs who areprone to resource guardingor who get aggressive when you take something away from them. Additionally, if your dog ever tries tochew up or swallow items, you should pay attention to this behavior and consider consulting an appropriatelyqualified and regulated behaviorist.\nHewitt says that instead of trying to deter this behavior, you should redirect your dog to something that they’re allowed to have, rather than your belongings. For example, you could consider having a toy that you save for this circumstance. Hewitt says that you can then teach them a leave or “drop it” cue while still allowing your dog to express the behavior with something more appropriate. “Then, you can ask them to drop your expensive designer shoes and swap for their favorite toy instead,” she adds.\nOverall, your dog being an obsessive gift-giver is really not a bad thing. They are just trying to help, in their own way, to create a welcoming and friendly environment for your guests. As long as they’re not chewing up your expensive belongings or picking up anything dangerous, it’s likely just them showing off. Who can blame them for that?",

    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/pet-behavior/can-pets-get-ptsd"
  },
  "page_content": "Thewildfires that ravagedLos Angeles in January brought out the best in the pet community. Animal lovers eagerlystepped up to helpbyadopting and fostering pets affected by the fires. One local veterinarianopened an empty hospitalto care for dozens of pets, while a Los Angeles shelterrescued more than 800 displaced animals.\nThese acts of kindness are a wonderful reminder of how communities can work together, but the road ahead is a long one. The people who went through these horrifying events will no doubt be processing them emotionally for a long time to come. But what happens to our pets’ little nervous systems after they go through something scary?\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nTraumatic events canaffect animals in the same way as they do humans; most mammals share the same basic brain structure. “The triggers can be different for different species due to many years of evolution and the need to avoid different dangers, says Dr. Ori Stollar, a veterinarian and behavior specialist withMassachusetts Veterinary Behavior Service. “But any trigger that causes severe fear or any emotional or physical stress has the potential to cause trauma.”\nSo, if pets react like we do to upsetting events, can they experience trauma or even get post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), too? And if so, how can we help them heal?\nPets respond to trauma like we do.\nJust like with humans, science has found that companion animals sometimes respond fearfully to triggers after experiencing extreme physical injury, disease, loud noises, and traumatic eventslike natural disasters. But veterinarians might hesitate before labeling these responses “PTSD.”\nAlthough we know that pets can internalize trauma, the term “PTSD” is generally a human term. Veterinary medicine does not have its ownDSM-5(mental-healthdiagnostic manual), Stollar points out, so veterinarians might hesitate to label a pet with any kind of condition or disorder. Still, he says, several studies have revealed behavioral changes in pets that mirror those seen in human PTSD —like anxiety, hypervigilance, andincreased aggression.\n“Not every pet with these behaviors has PTSD,” Stollar says. “But they might help us diagnose this condition if a comprehensive history is available and might also indicate the triggers that might lead to it.”\nHow can you tell if your pet is traumatized?\nSometimes, it’s hard to know how to care for an animal who’s struggling emotionally — we can’t exactly ask a dog or cat for alist of triggers. Still, veterinarians do have a few tools to help them better understand what’s going on with fearful pets.\n“There is progress being made with using techniques,such as fMRI, to monitor the brains of living animals without causing physical trauma to them,” Stollar says. And outside of that, monitoring dogs’ and cats’ behavior can also reveal a lot about their state of mind.\nFor instance, experts might ask pet parents to fill out questionnaires to explore how their dogs and cats interact with their environments — effectively mapping out how theyrespond to stress. (A distressed dog maylick their lips, while an anxious cat may make their ears low and flat.) In some studies, Stollar adds, scholars have observed animals trying to perform a task or solve a problem to find out if they are moreoptimistic or pessimistic.\nIf you believe that your pet is dealing with trauma, the best thing you can do is watch for any differences in how they act. This applies to dogs, cats, horses, and all other animals.\n“It might be something very easy to notice,” Stollar says — like a dog or cat becoming more aggressive to humans or other animals. They might become less sociable or begin avoiding specific people, locations, or situations. They might become hypervigilant or more reactive to their surroundings than they have been in the past.\nIn other cases, Stollar says, the signs are more subtle. Your pet might change their eating habits, either byeating lessor at a different pace than usual. Pets who used to graze throughout the day might startwolfing down their food all at once, and those who used to chow down immediately might begin taking their time. Their sleep patterns might change as well.\nMore often than not, Stollar says, cats are a little harder to read than dogs, “unless the change is presented as increased aggression.”\n“Many cats tend to avoid people and hide more when traumatized,” Stollar says. “And many cat owners might regard it as normal cat behavior. So, my advice would be that any behavior change, especially a sudden one or one that follows a traumatic event, should be addressed by going to the primary care veterinarian to rule out a medical issue, and then to areward-based trainerwith experience in this type of issues or a veterinary behaviorist.”\nWhat should you do if your pet exhibits signs of trauma?\nIf you know your pet’s triggers, avoid them as much as possible. For instance: If your dog can’tstand loud noises, don’t take them to loud venues and celebrations. If your cat suffered anextreme illnessthat required a specific diet, avoid reminding them of that experience by steering clear of foods that might taste or smell similar.\n“Because every pet is different, there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution,” Stollar says. “So knowing what the triggers are and avoiding them is a great first step.”\nIn some cases, pet parents can create positive experiences around old triggers to make them less stressful. In those cases, however, it’s best to move slowly and, when appropriate,work with a trainerto avoid scaring your pet even more. “Sometimes, the pet will be able to bounce back without us having to actively do anything,” Stollar says. “But if the behavior persists, then you should try to address it and prevent it from worsening.”\nWhen should you see a vet?\nEarly treatment is always better than waiting, Stollar says. In some cases,anti-anxiety medicationsmight be necessary to help your pet live peacefully and without fear.\nIf you’re familiar with gentle,rewards-based training methods, counterconditioning, desensitization, and environmental enrichment, you can try some work at home to see if your pet becomes more at ease. At the same time, Stollar cautions, “behavior issues can get worse fast — especially if they lead to physical danger to the pet or others around. If the pet parent is not skilled, then he or she should seek help as soon as possible.”\nThe sooner a qualified professional intervenes, the better off everyone involved will be.",

  "page_content": "We like to think we reallygetour pets. After all, they seem to read us pretty well; studies find that dogsrespond to human tears, try tomake us laugh,and cansmell when we’re stressed.But as much as we love our pups, when it comes to understanding their emotional states, we may not be as perceptive as we think we are.A new studypublished inAnthrozoösfound that humans rely on the outside environment to guess what a dog is feeling, instead of actually reading their behavior.\nTo test how well people read pups’ emotions, researchers recorded videos of dogs reacting to both positive and negative situations. Positive situations included being offered a toy or praise; negative situations included being reprimanded or seeing a vacuum.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nIn one experiment, researchers showed humans two versions of the videos: One with full context, and one with without a visual background. In another experiment, they showed humans edited versions of the videos with the context and reactionsswitched.For example, a participant might see a dog offered a toy paired with the dog’s reaction to being offered a vacuum. Over 850 participants rated how happy they thought dogs were in each situation.\nThe results were striking. Participants barely comprehended the dogs’ behavior — they focused solely on context. When people saw a dog react to a vacuum, they assumed the pup felt agitation. If they saw the same reaction paired with a dog receiving a leash, they assumed the dog felt joy. “There’s no evidence at all that people actually see the dog,”Clive Wynne,a co-author of the study, toldThe New York Times. “They seem to have a sort of a big blind spot around the dog himself.”\nHolly Molinaro, the study’s lead author, believes that humans anthropomorphize dogs and may project their own emotions onto their pups. “These assumptions of how you think the dog is feeling have nothing to do with the dog’s behavior or emotional cues, which is very striking,”Molinaro toldPhys.org.\nResearchers hope that the study will help pet parents be more aware of their own biases. Understanding dogs through their own behaviors, rather than a human lens, may help improve their welfare. “The first step is just to be aware that we are not that good at reading dogs’ emotions,”Molinaro toldEarth.com. “We need to be humbler in our understanding of our dogs.”",

    "title": "Dogs Actually Like It When You Talk to Them in a Baby Voice, Study Says",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/do-dogs-like-baby-voice"
  },
  "page_content": "I am one of those people who has no idea how to interact with a baby. They’re lovely, but I just don’t possess the innate ability to hold them without it being horribly awkward for both of us — and most importantly, I have zero clue what to say to them or how to say it.\nWhy, then, have I always known how to greet a dog? With zero self-consciousness, I have always approached dogs and said hello with what can only be described as unbridled enthusiasm and a singsong voice. I use the same baby talk that Ishouldfeel comfortable using with an actual human infant but don’t.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nDo dogs enjoy baby talk?\nAs it turns out, dogs not only enjoy the voice I use to talk to them, but science has shown their brains respond positively to it. Astudy from 2018found that dogs preferred “dog-directed speech” (basically, a fancy way of saying “baby talk for dogs”) when it’s paired with “dog-related content.” In other words, they like when we coo at them while we give them treats, walks, or thosegood belly rubs.\nA2023 study using MRIsalso found that the voices we use really do have an effect on how pups respond to us. In the study, dogs’ brains responded more to “infant-directed speech” or “dog-directed speech” — again, just fancy words for baby talk. This was especially true when the person doing the voice sounded female (suggesting that a high pitch is important).\nThis makes perfect sense to veterinarian Dr. Krista Williams at theBay Cities VCA Animal Hospital, in Burlington, Ontario, Canada who notes that dogs respond to certain tones and the intonation of our voice. “When it comes to communicating with our dogs, it’s more abouthowthings are said, versus the words we actually say,” Williams says. “Dogs often interpret a singsong tone as an invitation to play and may respond by wagging their tail or doing a play bow.”\nAre there any benefits to using baby talk?\nObviously, there are pet parents out there who don’t use baby talk — and their dogs are probably perfectly happy creatures. But baby talk does have its benefits (apparently,cats love it, too), and it could actually signal to a dog that you’re on their side. “It comes off to them as cheerful or that you approve of their actions,” Williams says.\nVeterinarian Dr. Bethany Hsia, founder ofCodaPet, uses baby talk with her own two pups, and the enthusiastic tail wags and very intentional listening don’t go unnoticed. “Baby talk can capture a dog’s attention because it mimics the sounds associated with positive social interactions, signaling affection and engagement,” Dr. Hsia says.\nIn other words, it suggests to your dog that you think they’re doing a great job — and that you’re encouraging them to keep doing what they’re doing. What’s more, it strengthens your relationship with your canine bestie. “The main benefit is that when we speak to our dogs, it helps build our bond with them and improves our ability to communicate with each other,” Williams says.\nSo, if your dog was uncertain if it was OK to jump up on the sofa, and you responded in a singsong voice as you were telling them to get off, they’d feel reassured that what they just did was kosher with you (even if it wasn’t). “When we use a lower pitch or volume, for example, dogs may interpret this as us expressing disappointment in their behavior,” Williams adds. So, in the case of a couch-jump, you’d want to keep your voice in the baritone range, or you know, something adjacent to that.\nBut if you’re having a particularly lengthy conversation with your dog (as weall do from time to time), baby talk is the way to go if you want to keep them engaged. “Studies have shown that dogs spend more time looking at and interacting with the speaker using baby talk, especially when the content is relevant to them, such as [when you are] discussing treats or walks,” Hsia says.\nIs baby talk ever harmful?\nCooing to your canine kiddo is generally harmless, but there are a couple of instances where you should avoid it. Obviously, if your dog is doing something they shouldn’t be — likegnawing on a bar of toxic chocolate— you’ll want to put the brakes on the baby talk.\n“If you need your dog to stop a behavior that would be dangerous for them, such as crossing a busy road or eating something that could be poisonous, using a strong, lower-pitched voice is recommended in those instances, as they will be more likely to stop the behavior,” Williams says.\nYou should also be careful with baby talk during training. Training should always usepositive reinforcement, and baby talk (along with a special treat) could be a positive means of telling your dog what they’re doing right. But veterinarianDr. Mariam Ferrernotes that using baby talk thewrong wayduring training could send your dog the wrong message. Overusing a high-pitched voice without consistency “might lead to confusion,” Ferrer says, particularly when you’re trying to teach your dog cues.\nFor example, using the“sit” cuein a singsong voice might be a bit confusing for your pup. But using clear cues andthenoffering positive reinforcement in a singsong voice could encourage their smart behavior.\nHow else can you communicate with your pup?\nIt’s important to note that speaking in a singsong voice isn’t the only way to keep the lines of communication open with your dog. Williams notes that one of the best ways to connect with them is to understand their body language. “This will allow you to be your dog’s best advocate,” she says.\nCharts that explaindog body language and behaviorcan be helpful, especially for pet parents who aren’t familiar with some essential signs. You might not realize, for example, that yawningcan mean anxietyand panting can mean your dog’sin pain. Knowing a bit about the science of why your pup is acting a certain way helps the two of you bond even more.\nInterestingly, there’s one big difference between the way we speak to dogs and babies: While we use the same voice pitch with both, this2024 studysays we don’t make the same overly expressive faces with dogs that we do when we speak gibberish to babies.\nHonestly, that’s probably for the best; our patient pups put up with enough.",

    "title": "These Dogs Take a Couple Days to Adjust to Daylight Saving Time, New Study Says",

  "page_content": "Get ready to reset your watches and microwaves (your iPhone’s got itself covered), because this Sunday is daylight saving time. Most humans aren’t super fond of the concept — in fact, oneBusiness Insiderpoll foundthat three out of five Americans would prefer to do away with it altogether. It’s especially easy to complain about in springtime, when we lose an hour of sleep — though we do gain some precious evening sunlight. And because our routines are inevitably our dogs’ routines, many pet parents wonder if our beloved pups hate the change, too.\nMyriad studies have questioned the effect of daylight saving time on people’s overall health and safety, includingone that foundcar crashes increase after daylight saving, and another that associated daylight saving with anincreased risk of stroke. But when it comes to our dogs, anew studypublished inPLOS Onefound that not all companion dogs need time to adjust to the new schedule — butworking dogs do.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhen it comes to our pups, “there is a dearth of understanding of how this sudden, human-mitigated change affects the routines of companion animals,” Lavania Nagendran, the study’s lead author, wrote. To investigate the under-researched topic, scientists observed 25 sled dogs and 29 companion dogs in Ontario during a “fall back” daylight saving time period. To control for any breed-level differences, all recruited companion dogs and sled dogs were either Huskies or Malamutes. Researchers used accelerometers, devices that measures an object’s acceleration, to record the activity of the dogs and humans around sunrise and when their handlers or guardians arrived.\nThey then compared the average activity measures from the week prior to daylight saving time to activity measures from the three days following the switch. For working dogs, they noticed a significant difference in activity on the morning of daylight saving time; these pups were “significantly more active” before their handlers arrived on the day of the switch. In the two days after, they returned to their pre-daylight-saving levels.\nWhen it came to companion dogs, the findings were different. Non-worker dogs showed no difference in activity levels before and after the transition. Older dogs were an exception;senior pupswere less active the morning after daylight saving time. “We recommend caregivers of older dogs to be especially mindful in implementing sudden changes to daily routines,” Nagendran wrote.\nResearchers conclude that a more gradual change in a routine, especially for older dogs and working dogs, may be helpful as they adjust to the time change. While thePLOS Onestudy took place during the fall, it’s likely that the same principle applies this spring. If you have a senior or working pup on your hands, it might be worth incrementally adjusting their feeding schedulenow, rather than waiting until Sunday.Overall, though, dogs — regardless of age or responsibilities — adjust pretty quickly to the switch-up in schedule… unlike us humans, who already plan to complain all the way through next week.",

    "title": "Why Does Your Dog Pace at Night?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/why-does-my-dog-pace-at-night"
  },
  "page_content": "We’ve all had restless nights, whether from too much caffeine, worrying about the next day, or just thinking about that weird thing you said three years ago. But what do you do when your dog is the one pacing the floor — and keeping you up as a result? Can dogs have a bad night’s sleep?\nDog’s sleep patterns are notablydifferent than those of humans, but they can still experience restlessness — and it can turn into a long night. Why do dogs pace? There area lotof potential reasons, some more serious than others.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n“If your dog is pacing every night, there’s a reason,” dog trainer and behavior consultantDaniel Nealesays. “Finding the root cause is key to helping them relax.”\nIt’s a personal preference, but here are the pros and cons.\nOne of the most common reasons for restlessness and dogs pacing at night is anxiety or stress. These feelings can be the result of environmental changes, new situations, orloud noises, like storms or fireworks. “Dogs struggling with separation anxiety or general nervousness often pace at night because they can’t relax,” Neale says. “This is especially true for dogs used to sleeping near their people.”\nSome dogs may pace if they’re hungry or thirsty, so it’s important to ensure they’re getting a nutritious diet during regular mealtimes. If your dog is hungry during the night, it may be time to do your research and make sure your pup is getting everything they need in their meals.\nYounger and older dogs may wake up in the night needing to go outside, especially if they’re new to your family and not yet used to your routine. Most dogs will give signs that they need to go out, such as whimpering or scratching at the door, but some may pace as well.\nIf your dog doesn’t get an appropriateamount of exercise, they could become restless and reluctant to settle down at bedtime. This is especially true of puppies and younger dogs who tend tosleep more in the dayand may be ready to play at night. “A dog that isn’t physically and mentally satisfied during the day isn’t going to be magically tired at night,” Neale notes. “If your dog has excess energy, pacing is one way it’s going to show up.”\nAs dogs grow older, they may experience more joint pain, which can cause restless pacing. They may also deal with changes in cognitive function or disorientation, which can lead to pacing and other unusual behaviors.\nIf your dogfeels pain, especially suddenly, they may start pacing restlessly. Milder pain or discomfort can also cause this behavior. “Dogs dealing with arthritis, digestive issues, or even something as simple as an uncomfortable sleeping surface might pace instead of lying down,” Neale says. “If your dog shifts positions frequently but never seems settled, pain is a real possibility.”\nMedical reasons for nighttime pacing\nWhile a pacing dog isn’t usually a reason to worry, it’s important to monitor the behavior and look for any additional symptoms that could indicate a medical issue. Look out for signs like limping, scratching, or whimpering that could indicate your dog is in pain or suffering from something else.\nAging dogs can experience changes in brain function, comparable to dementia in people.Cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS)is a common concern for senior dogs and can cause unusual behaviors like restlessness and pacing.\n“Older dogs are prone to night pacing because their internal body clock gets thrown off,” Neale says. “They lose track of time, feel disoriented, and may start pacing aimlessly.”\nPain can be a major cause of pacing or other restless behaviors and is usually accompanied bypanting or whining.If your dog is in pain, they may have trouble settling down or getting comfortable. Contact your vet if you suspect your dog is in any kind of pain.\nGastrointestinal discomfortcan make your dog restless at night and lead to pacing. Keep an eye out for other related symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in appetite.\nSome medical conditions or diseases can cause changes in brain function, which can cause your dog to engage in unusual behaviors like pacing or walking sideways. Issues like seizure disorders, brain tumors, toxin exposure, or some liver diseases can all result in changes in brain function. Contact your vet immediately if your dog shows any other symptoms of unusual behavior.\nEmotional and behavioral triggers\nAnxiety and stress are often the most common reasons for behavioral changes in dogs, but they aren’t the only emotions that can impact the way your dog acts.\nIf your dog paces at night when you’re not home, the root cause could beseparation anxiety. Dogs may engage in a number of unusual behaviors when they’re upset about being separated from you, so work with your vet or a behaviorist to help your dog feel more comfortable on their own.\nMany dogs havestrong fearsaround loud noises, particularly thunder and fireworks. If these noises are happening at night, your dog may be too afraid to fall asleep. Look for ways to reduce their anxiety around these triggers.\nSometimes dogs do things like pace just because they’re bored or want to get your attention. Invest in interactive toys or training classes to keep your dog entertained and mentally engaged.\nEnvironmental factors\nChanges to your dog’s environment can cause stress and anxiety, leading to restless nighttime behaviors like pacing. If you’ve recently moved to a new home or introduced a new pet or family member, your dog may react to this change with unusual behaviors. Similarly, any changes in their daily routine orsleeping locationcan trigger behaviors like pacing as well.\n“Dogs experience the world differently than we do,” Neale says. “What seems like a peaceful night to us might be full of noises and scents that they find unsettling. Wildlife outside, a neighbor’s TV, or even a change in room temperature could be triggering restlessness.”\nOr is this something you only think is happening?\nHow to help your dog stop pacing at night\nWhen your dog is restless, you’re likely not sleeping all that well either, especiallyif they sleep with you. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to help your dog settle down so you can both enjoy a good night’s sleep.\n“Dogs don’t pace just because they feel like it,” Neale says. “It’s always a message. Whether it’s pain, stress, or something more serious, it’s our job to figure it out. And if you’re unsure, get your vet involved. You’d rather catch an issue early than wait until it gets worse.”\nDogs are creatures of habit, which means they thrive on consistent routines. Make an effort to feed, walk, and play with your dog at the same time each day to help reduce potential restlessness andanxiety at night.\nWhether your dog gets enough exercise during the day can have a huge impact on their nighttime behavior. Consider scheduling time for an evening walk or play session, which not only burns off energy, but can also help keep your dog healthy and strengthen your bond.\nWatch your dog for additional symptoms beyond pacing, which may besigns of an underlying medical issue. If your dog suddenly starts pacing frequently, take them to the vet for an exam as soon as possible.\nIf your dog has trouble settling down for sleep, try comforting tactics like playing soft music, using pheromone diffusers, or offering verbal comfort and petting. You can also see ifCBD treatswork for your dog to help them feel more relaxed and soothed.\nWe all like to be comfy when we settle down to sleep, and dogs are no different. Make a space in your home designated just for their bedtime, away from busier areas where people may move around. Choose a bed that’s large enough for your dog and consider adding some cozy bedding or favorite toys they can snuggle.\nA large meal before bedtime can give your dog an upset stomach, just like you, resulting in restlessness or even pacing. Try to schedule your dog’s dinner time earlier in the evening and consider giving them a small snack closer to bedtime.\nJust as your dogneeds physical exercise, they also need mental exercise to stay healthy. Invest in interactive toys, puzzle feeders, and other games and activities that engage your dog’s mind. Training and regular playtime can also help keep your dog mentally stimulated and ensure they’re ready for bed.\nTry to limit anything that could keep your dog awake, like noises or lights. Consider moving your dog’s bed to a quieter location if they’re near anything that could prevent them from resting.\nFAQs\nMedical issues usually have multiple symptoms, so look out for other signs your dog is suffering from an underlying medical condition, likechanges in appetite, signs of pain, or unusual behavior.\nThe right diet is essential for your dog’s health and wellbeing, including their sleep patterns. Things like overeating, eating too close to bedtime, or an improper diet can cause discomfort and disrupt your dog’s sleep.\nSenior dogs tend to experience more changes in their sleep because of age. Things like joint pain or cognitive dysfunction can impact an older dog’s sleep. Always make sure to discuss any major behavioral changes with your dog’s vet, as well ashow much sleep is healthy.\nReferences\nAdams, G.J., and K.G.

  "page_content": "Puppies make a lot of things look easy, including their ability to completely nod off in the time it takes to set down your car keys and groceries. How does sleep come so naturally to those who are so active? Well, the truth is, sleep is a necessity for puppies, and the more is usually the better. Here’s why.\nWhy do puppies sleep so much?\nThere’s a lot going on in a puppy’s body. Everything is new and exciting and comes with a bit of a learning curve. Sleep is a puppy’s way of recovering physically and mentally from the normal stresses of the day. Puppies tend to sleep more than adults because they need to recover from their high energy outbursts and training sessions. They also need to provide their body with a little downtime so it can go about growing and developing in a healthy way.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nDepending on your puppy’s age, it may seem like they’re sleeping through the entire day. While the total hours of sleep may come close to the total hours in a day, puppies generally don’t sleep straight through. Instead, they’ll takeshort napsevery couple of hours.\nSix reasons why puppies need so much sleep\nWe all know you have to put something in to get something out. That’s the way vending machines, exercise, and even puppies work. To get a healthy, active puppy, you need to put in a little rest and recuperation. Here’s why puppies need to sleep so much.\nThe body is an amazing thing, especially when it’s in its growth phase. All cell types are in near constant activity, dividing and growing so that a pup can increase in size as well as maturity. It takes a lot to fuel a phenomenon like this, which is why your puppy may go through hunger phases, where they constantly want more no matter how much food you give them. Sleep is also important as this is a time when growth hormones are released, the brain gets achance to restructure, and everything rests up for the next go-around.\nIt’s no secret that the more active you are, the more sleep you need. You can hear your bed calling after a day of fresh air and activity, but maybe not so much after a day of couch surfing. Well, your puppy definitely spends more days in activity than they do couch surfing, so sleep is an important part of recovering from that activity. Muscles and brain cells all need rest to build back the strength and stamina required of them.\nThere’s a huge size difference between a teacup Poodle and a Great Dane; anyone can see that. But size isn’t the only thing different among dog breeds. The time spent sleeping can also vary. Large-breed puppies tend to sleep longer than smaller breeds. Though small-breed dogs are little balls of energy, larger breeds actually expend more energy. So, if you have a large or giant breed puppy, they may sleep more than their smaller cohorts.\nYou may also think your puppy is sleeping a lot because of the time of the day. Sleeping after meals is a normal behavior, not because your puppy is in a food coma, but because the body naturally diverts blood flow to the digestive tract after eating, making a puppy sleepy. Puppies are usually fed several small meals throughout the day, which makes for several after-meal naps.\nThe dog days of summer can really zap your energy. Though this time of year is named forcelestial patterns rather than a dog’s ability to laze around, it holds true that the hotter it is outside, the more a dog will likely sleep. If your puppy is sleeping more than normal, it could be that the higher temps are getting to them.\nOn the flip side, if it’s too cold, your puppy may not be sleeping enough simply because they can’t get comfortable. Try to maintain a constant, comfortable temperature in your puppy’s sleep space for the best results.\nWe all remember as kids how we got to spend sick days sleeping on the couch. Well, sleeping more could be your puppy’s way of dealing with an illness. Look for other signs, such as not eating, vomiting, diarrhea, or a fever, and talk to your vet if you think your puppy is sick.\nFour signs your puppy is ready for a nap.\nWhen to be concerned about your puppy’s sleeping habits\nYour puppy will literally change by the day, so their habits and schedule may too. However, you’ll still be able to pick up major differences just by knowing what’s normal for your pup.\nYour puppy is going to take a lot of naps throughout the day, but that’s much different than sleeping too much. If you start to notice that they’d rather nap than play, greet you at the door, or do any of the other things they used to live for, they may be sleeping too much. If they’d rather play all night and sleep during the day, you may need to shift their sleeping schedule to include more awake time during daylight hours and more sleep at night. Sleeping too much could mean there’s something going on with their health that is concerning.\nNot sleeping enough can take its toll on your puppy as well. Of course, tiredness is a sign that they’re not sleeping enough, and a tired puppy will be lethargic and uninterested in their normal things. They may attempt to go with you on a walk but then tire easily. They may alsobecome clingieror want to hide out most of the time. Overly tired puppies may also be more aggressive, bark more, orget into trouble.\nHow to make sure your puppy is getting enough sleep\nPuppies may seem like they can sleep just about anywhere, but the better you set up their sleep environment, the better sleep they will get. Start by giving them aquiet spacewhere they feel safe and out of the way. Regulate the temperature so that it’s not too hot or too cold. Give them a comfy bed that’s big enough for them tostretch out on their backor curl up in however they want to sleep. Some puppies will play until they drop, so don’t give them a chance to. Cut play time and training sessions short so that there’s time for a nap.\nYour puppy will likelysleep better at nightwhile you’re sleeping, so try to shift their schedule so that they have more awake and active time during the day and more time to sleep at night.\nThere are pros and cons of sleeping with your dog — for both of you.\nCan I let my puppy sleep as much as they want?\nA healthy puppy will regulate their sleep accordingly, meaning you shouldn’t have to do much to ensure they’re getting what they need. But if your puppy is struggling to find a quiet space, it’s up to you to make better arrangements for them. Also, if your puppy is sleeping more than their normal amount, especially if they’re showing other concerning signs, speak to your veterinarian.\nBottom line\nPuppies require a lot of sleep to allow their body the rest it needs to grow and develop properly. You can help make sure your puppy is getting enough sleep by providing them with a quiet, comfortable space and allowing them time to nap whenneeded.vIfyour puppy is sleeping more than their normal amount, speak to your veterinarian to rule out health issues.\nFAQs\nIt may seem like some puppiessleep throughout the dayand that could be normal, especially for really young puppies or those who aren’t sleeping as much at night. If your puppy just started to sleep more during the day, this could be a sign that something is wrong, so speak to your vet.\nMost three-month-old puppies will sleep around 16 hours per day and maybe more if they’re a large breed. Puppies may also sleep more if there have been a lot of changes in their life, such as a new home, vaccinations, or settling into a new schedule. It could be perfectly normal for your puppy to sleep a lot, but monitor them for other signs and speak to a vet if you notice anything else out of the ordinary.\nMost puppies who are three months old will sleep around 16 hours per day. This can vary based on breed, size, and activity level.\nBy six months of age, most puppies will have settled into their adult sleep patterns and will sleep around 12 to 14 hours per day. This can vary if you have a large or very active breed.\nHow much sleep is normal for puppies?\nIt depends on your puppy’s age. Dogs who are zero to eight weeks need 15 to 22 hours of sleep, so it’s normal for your young pup to snooze all day. After six months, dogs will need 12 to 14 hours a day. In short, they need their naps!\nReferences\nDillon, McKenzie. “How Much Should Dogs Sleep?

  "page_content": "Squeaky toys are incredibly popular among dogs — and significantly less so among pet parents. Yes, those squeaking sounds are annoying, especially when your dogjust won’t stopdoing it. What’s so great about a squeaky plush squirrel, anyway?\n“Squeaky toys are like the dog version of a great thriller — exciting, unpredictable, and totally engaging,” dog behavior expert and trainerShelby Semelsays. “The sound taps into their natural instincts, triggering that chase-and-capture drive.”\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nDog toys that squeak offer instant feedback for pups, Semel says, which makes them more interesting and stimulating than a toy that doesn’t make any noise or move. Below, we explore what dogs love about squeaky toys and how to choose the best options for your canine friend.\nAnd why are specific ones (looking at you, Lamb Chop) such popular favorites?\nWhy do dogs like squeaky toys?\nPlaytime is quite a bit more than entertainment — it’s a way for your dog to healthily engage in their natural instincts and to get the physical and mental stimulation they need. Your dog could easily grow bored without plenty of fun and interactive toys available, and squeaky toys especially provide a number of benefits to curious pups.\n“Studies show that dogs naturally prefer toys that make noise and have a chewable texture, which suggests it’s not just about play — it’s about sensory satisfaction,” Semel says. “Some dogs will even adjust how they bite a squeaky toy to control the sound, showing just how engaged they are. Whether they’re gently squeaking it or going full destruction mode, it’s keeping them busy, happy, and mentally engaged.”\nMany dogs like playing with toys that simulate prey animals, and squeaky toys fall squarely in that category. A dog squeaky toy sounds like — and sometimes evenlookslike — small animals, aka prey for wild dogs. With a squeaky toy, your dog gets to enact their natural hunting instincts and pretend they’re a big bad wolf, safelygetting out any aggression.\n“Squeaky toys tap into a dog’s natural predatory instincts,” dog trainer and behavior consultantAlexandra Bassettsays. “The high-pitched squeak mimics the sound of small prey animals, making the toy seem ‘alive’ and more engaging.”\nFor some dogs, a squeaky toy’s high-pitched noise can be very satisfying. So can ripping the toy apart. Thanks to their sound and texture, squeaky toys provide sensory stimulation, and with plenty of variety in toys, your dog can enjoy mental enrichment that keeps them brain-healthy and happy.\nFavorite toys can be surprisingly effective training aids, especially if your dog isn’t supermotivated by food. Squeaky animal dog toys can quickly get your dog’s attention, and the sound can establish positive reinforcement for good behaviors.\nSqueaky toys for dogs — and other kinds of toys — can helpprevent boredomby giving your dog a healthy outlet to chew, play, and bite. Set aside regular time to play to help encourage your dog’s natural instincts in an appropriate way.\nThe science behind dogs’ love for squeaky toys\nDogs’ instinctual love for squeaky toys goes all the way back to their ancient roots. Squeaky toys mimic thesound of prey, which triggers a dog’s predatory instincts and their most primal hunting behaviors. It’s a little disturbing when you think about it, but playing with a squeaky toy allows your dog to tap into their natural urge to hunt and capture. Those squeaky noises, for dogs, are just like the sounds a small animal makes when a predator (aka your pup) pounces.\nThe high-pitched sound of a squeaky toy also triggers the release of dopamine, the “feel good” neurotransmitter in the brain. Other pleasurable activities for dogs, like receiving a treat or petting, also release dopamine, establishing a positive association with these activities.\nBenefits of squeaky toys for dogs\nPlaytime with squeaky toys is more than just a game — providing toys for your dog and setting aside time to play can have actual benefits on your dog’s health and well-being.\nA variety of toys, including squeaky ones, can provide your dog with much-needed mental stimulation, keeping them entertained — and away from things they shouldn’t chew, like your shoes.\n“[Squeaky toys] help prevent boredom,” Semel says. “Studies show that dogs who have access to engaging toys are less likely to develop destructive behaviors. A squeaky toy provides constant feedback, keeping their brains busy.”\nRegular playtime gives your dog the physical exercise they need to stay healthy. Plus, a chewy toy can provide a safe outlet for chewing behavior that could easily be destructive otherwise.\nA squeaky toy is a quick way for your dog to get your attention and invite you to play with them. Sharing playtime with your pup can createpositive bonding experiencesfor both of you, offering a shared source of enjoyment thatbrings you closer. “Play is one of the best ways to strengthen the human-dog relationship,” Semel notes. “Engaging in a game of tug or fetch with a squeaky toy creates positive associations and helps build trust.”\nHaving a toy to focus their attention can help reduce feelings ofanxiety and stressin your dog. A favorite toy often provides a sense of comfort and security that can help with issues like separation anxiety.\nDepending on what material a toy is made of, it may be able to help improve your dog’sdental health. Toys made of rubber with small nubs can help massage your dog’s gums and even scrape away any tartar buildup on their teeth.\nHow to choose safe squeaky toys\nWhen you give your dog a new toy, it’s always a good idea to supervise them until you know how they play with it — andhow destructivethey’ll be. Make sure not toleave your dog alonewith any toys that they may easily destroy or take apart, and check toys regularly for any damage that could lead to ingestion tokeep your dog safe.\n“When in doubt, look for toys labeled for tough chewers or ask your vet for recommendations,” Semel says. “Safety first — fun second!”\nChoose dog toys made fromnon-toxic materialsthat are less likely to present a hazard to your pet. You can also alter any toys that aren’t dog-safe by removing dangerous items like strings or eyes that your dog could take off and eat.\nWhen selecting toys for your dog, choose toys that are the right size for your pet. If a toy is too small, it could be achoking hazard. On the other hand, if a toy is too large, it may be difficult for your dog to play with.\nLimit your dog’s playtime, especially with their favorite toys, to help toys last longer and prevent overuse. Make sure to throw away any toys that are severely damaged from chewing and play.\nIf your dog has a tendency to destroy soft toys, always supervise their playtime. Swallowing a squeaker or toy can lead to serious medical issues and often requires surgery. Once playtime is done, put the toy away where your dog can’t reach it, which will also help toys last longer.\n“Always monitor your dog, especially if they tend to tear toys apart,” Bassett says. “Be ready and willing to stop a dog from destroying toys to get the squeaker out. It's advisable to play with a dog with a squeaky toy rather than just let them ‘have at it’ if they tend to destroy them.”\nTips for pet parents who want their pups to have safe fun.\nFAQs\nSqueaky toys activate a dog’s natural hunting and chewing instincts by mimicking the sound and feel of prey animals.\nLook for squeaky toys made of non-toxic materials that don’t have pieces your dog could easily swallow. Always supervise your dog’s playtime with new toys and make sure to dispose of any damaged toys.\nYou can use a favorite toy to help with training your dog. The toy can serve as a reward andpositive reinforcement for good behavior.\nEvery dog has their own preferences for food, playtime, and toys. Some dogs, likehunting breeds, may especially enjoy squeaky toys, while others may prefer a quieter chewing experience.\nReferences\n“Behavior Problems of the Dog and Cat - E-Book.”Google Books,books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=_IOxEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA345&dq=dogs+squeaky+toys&ots=m7f–we0e1&sig=jkL7eiIKsuxGGVO2zhUPqDH1mHY#v=onepage&q=squeaky&f=false.\n“Behavior Problems of the Dog and Cat - E-Book.”Google Books,books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=_IOxEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA345&dq=dogs+squeaky+toys&ots=m7f–we0e1&sig=jkL7eiIKsuxGGVO2zhUPqDH1mHY#v=onepage&q=squeaky&f=false.\nBradshaw, John W.S., et al. “Why Do Adult Dogs ‘Play’?”Behavioural Processes, vol. 110, Jan. 2015, pp. 82-87.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2014.09.023.\nBradshaw, John W.S., et al. “Why Do Adult Dogs ‘Play’?”Behavioural Processes, vol. 110, Jan. 2015, pp. 82-87.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2014.09.023.\nMehrkam, Lindsay R., et al. “The Influence of Breed and Environmental Factors on SOcial and Solitary Play in Dogs (Canis Lupus Familiaris).”Learning & Behavior, vol. 45, no. 4, July 2017, pp. 367-77.https://doi.org/10.3758/s13420-017-0283-0.\nMehrkam, Lindsay R., et al. “The Influence of Breed and Environmental Factors on SOcial and Solitary Play in Dogs (Canis Lupus Familiaris).”Learning & Behavior, vol. 45, no. 4, July 2017, pp. 367-77.https://doi.org/10.3758/s13420-017-0283-0.\nPullen, Anne Jennifer, et al. “Preferences for Toy Types and Presentations in Kennel Housed Dogs.”Applied Animal Behaviour Science, vol. 125, no. 3-4, July 2010, pp. 151-156.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2010.04.004.\nPullen, Anne Jennifer, et al. “Preferences for Toy Types and Presentations in Kennel Housed Dogs.”Applied Animal Behaviour Science, vol. 125, no. 3-4, July 2010, pp. 151-156.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2010.04.004.",

  },
  "page_content": "My dog, Willy, hides under the bathroom sink during thunderstorms. Sometimes my family finds him in an upstairs closet, and once I found him wedged behind the toilet. If he could hide under the bed, I’m sure he would — but it’s a platform bed, so there’s no room.\nLoud noises such as thunder, fireworks, or a car alarm are scary for dogs. They may whine, pace, pant, or bark. Often, they’ll hide, and the space under beds seems to be a common place for dogs to cower. That’s especially true if they already associate the bedroom with comfort and security.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhy do dogs hide under the bed?\nAlicia Collins, professional trainer, is the founder and CEO atK9 Activity Club & Lodge. She says sometimes dogs choose to hide under the bed because it’s cozy and den-like. “If they are hidingbecause of fearor anxiety,” she says, “you might want to take some steps to help them overcome the desire to hide.”\nUsing these tips, your skittish dog will warm up to you.\n8 reasons why your dog is hiding under the bed\n“Hiding under the bed is a reasonable response to something scary, since being out in the open could leave them open to harm,” Collins says. “It’s smart to seek shelter, assess the danger, and come out when it’s safe.”\nIf the fear isn’t addressed, the behavior can escalate. The next time your dog is scared of a loud noise you can’t avoid, try speaking calmly to them, patting them gently (they might be trembling), and creating some positive association with the event by giving them treats or a toy.\nLike Willy’s urge to hide when thunder rumbles, Collins said hiding is a normal response to fear of loud noises. “Big scary noises warrant a quick place to hide and under the bed is the perfect place to wait it out,” she says. “The next question is, ‘How quickly do they recover from that scary loud noise?’” You can help your dog recover by speaking calmly to them and creating some positive association with the event by giving them treats or a play session.\nWhen he was a puppy, Willy stole my kids’ socks and hid them under the porch. If I could squeeze under there, I’m certain I’d find a pile of long-lost socks. Your dog might be saying, “‘Can’t get me under here!’” Collins says. “Finding a place to hide with high-value items is smart, even if it’s frustrating.”\nWe’ve all heard that sick or injured wild animals will go alone into the forest to die. Hiding can be your dog’s evolutionary response to illness. “Natural instincts can kick in, and dogs who are sick or injured will seek a safe place to protect themselves from predators, even if there’s no real threat around,” Collins says.\nLook for other out-of-the-ordinary behaviors such as loss of appetite, lethargy, paw-licking, and refusing to go outside. Did they eat something that made them sick, like chocolate? More obvious signs of illness include vomiting, diarrhea, runny eyes and nose, stiffness, and difficulty pooping. If your dog is older, it’s also possible that they can become more anxious as their hearing and vision change, which may lead them to feel unsettled.\nUnless you’re in the habit of stashing bones under your bed, Collin says this is not a likely reason for a dog to hide under a bed. They may, however, hide under the kitchen table if food is what they’re after.\nThe arrival of a new baby, persistent loud noises from the renovation next door, or a houseguest who’s not a dog person can scatter a dog. “Any type of worry would drive them to seek a quiet place to wait out the potential threat,” Collins says.\n“Dogs don’t necessarily want privacy in the same way people do,” Collins says. “But they could be looking for a quiet place to retreat to.”\nDogs don’t tend to make themselves scarce as much as cats when visitors arrive, but if they don’t like someone (or sense someone doesn’t like them) they might hide from that person. “Hiding under the bed from a person they perceive as a threat, or maybe a kid that is just too much, seems like a reasonable reason to hide,” Collins says.\nHow to keep your dog mentally and physically safe this New Year.\nShould you stop your dog from hiding under the bed?\nSome dogs will hide under the bed to feel safe in uncertain situations. “Hiding from an annoying child or just resting under the bed because it’s comfortable is fine if you're OK with it,” Collins says. She recommends stopping the behavior if it stems from fear, anxiety, or illness. “If they are sick or injured, you will need to access the injury/illness and monitor them where you can easily see them.”\nHow to get your dog to stop hiding under the bed\nIf the behavior has been going on awhile, Collins says it’s tricky to address. “The best course of action is to anticipate when it’s likely to happen, and set up an alternative option to prevent it,” she says. “Blocking the bed or shutting the door to the bedroom is an easy first step.”\nRemember Snoopy’s dog house? Set up a safe, cozy space for your dog, and reward them when they use it. “Setting up a cozy crate that mimics a hiding place is easier for you to control and might be a good alternative,” Collins says.\n“Getting a dog out from hiding under the bed can take skill, patience, and maybe a little of both,” Collins says. “Use a sweet voice and bribe them with treats if necessary, or simply wait them out. Use that time to formulate your action plan for next time.”\nIf a dog is frequently hiding under the bed and shaking or trembling, they mightsuffer from anxiety. Consult a trainer or vet to determine the source of the anxiety and consider ananxiety-relief product.“No person or dog enjoys being scared or anxious,” Collins says. “We always want to help guide our dogs out of fear or anxiety.”\nWhat’s the difference between sleeping vs. hiding under the bed?\nYour pup’s body language will tell you if they’re napping comfortably under the bed or hiding from a perceived threat. Some dogs like toburrow under blanketsthat might have fallen from the bed to the floor.\nWhen is hiding under the bed a cause for concern?\n“Hiding under the bed is concerning if it becomes the dog’s main way to deal with a problem. If that is the case, or they are trying to bite you, it’s time to get the help of a professional,” Collins says.\nBottom line\nDogs hide under the bed for several reasons, the most common being fear of something in their environment.\nDogs hide under the bed for several reasons, the most common being fear of something in their environment.\nOther reasons include protecting something they’ve found, a change in their environment, a guest they don’t like, or a simple desire to retreat to a quiet place.\nOther reasons include protecting something they’ve found, a change in their environment, a guest they don’t like, or a simple desire to retreat to a quiet place.\nIf the behavior is accompanied by signs of sickness or injury, consult a veterinarian.\nIf the behavior is accompanied by signs of sickness or injury, consult a veterinarian.\nFAQs\nA dog’s sudden instinct to hide under the couch is connected to their evolution in den-like environments. If they do this, try to figure out if something in their environment is scaring them.\nA lot of times it means a dog is trying to get away from a perceived threat such as a loud noise.\nLook for a change in your environment. Is there new construction noise? A prolonged windstorm? A change in schedule or a loud house guest? All of these factors can lead a dog to hide.\nMany dogs do hide when they’re sick, because hiding can be an evolutionary response to illness.",

    "title": "Dogs Clearly Have a Favorite Color, New Study Finds",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/news/dogs-favorite-color-study"
  },
  "page_content": "By now, most pet parents know that the old idea that dogs see in black and white is a myth. It’s true that dogs have a much more limited color spectrum than most humans, but they can see arange of blue and yellow shades,similarly to humans with red-green color blindness. And just as they have strong opinions on theirfavorite toysandsnacks,dogs have a fondness for one color more than the other.A new studyfound that street dogs in India show a strong preference for yellow.\nScientists at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research carried out tests on 134 adult street dogs in urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. An experimenter set out three bowls near a dog before vocalizing to get the pup’s attention; the bowls were yellow, blue, and gray. The bowls were placed in a random order each time.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nIn some of the tests, each bowl had a biscuit. In others, there was no food in the bowls. In each version of the test, yellow emerged as the most chosen bowl by far.\nThey then studied the preference between just blue and gray bowls. There was no significant preference between these colors.\nIn the final experiment, researchers offered the dogs a choice between a gray bowlwithfood and a yellow bowlwithoutfood. Amazingly, the dogs still approached the yellow bowl; the yellow bowl was chosen 41 times, while the gray bowl with food was only chosen 11 times. When they used chicken instead of a biscuit in the gray bowl, the results held; the empty yellow bowl was chosen 47 times, and the gray bowl with food was chosen 14 times.\n“Our experiments demonstrate a clear preference for the color yellow over blue and gray in FRDs of India, at least in the context of foraging,”Anamitra Roy, the study’s lead author, wrote. “This preference is so strong that it supersedes their attraction towards food, whether biscuit or chicken.”\nExperimenters aren’t sure exactly why dogs love yellow so much. One guess is that for dogs who scavenge, raw meat and blood appear yellow, and so do many foods available to them of human origin which use turmeric and dried chili. It may be that yellow bowls had a higher contrast to the other bowls. They also note that color preference can be innate or learned, so it’s possible that their results are localized. For example,a separate studyfound that street dogs in Morocco had no color preference. Regardless of the reason, yellow was the clear favorite for these pups. Loving a color more than a treat? That’s a whole lot of love.",

    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/why-does-my-dog-sleep-against-me"
  },
  "page_content": "My dog, Willy, usually hits the pillow before I do and moves reluctantly to a spot beside me when I go to bed. At some point in the night, he relocates to sleep at the foot of the bed. Willy is a shaggy black-and-white Collie rescue who, fortunately, doesn’t shed. In the winter, all of this is cute and cozy; in the summer, it’s a little stifling. Plus, in warmer weather, I worry he’ll comeinside with ticks. More than once, I’ve had to change the sheets because he climbed into bed with muddy paws.\nMichelle Baker, a dog behavior specialist and owner ofFurkids Inc., a dog daycare and enrichment center, says your dog’s preference for sleeping against you is a natural and affectionate behavior. “Whether you allow it depends on your comfort level and lifestyle,” she says. “As long as it’s not causing sleep disruptions or signaling distress, it can be a heartwarming way to bond. But if it becomes excessive or problematic, a little training — or a vet visit — may be the best solution.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nUnderstanding dog sleeping behavior\nDogs’ choice of where to sleep tells us what makes them feel secure. Brett Reynolds, director of dog care forThe Dog Stopand a certified fear-free animal trainer, says comfort and security are the likeliest reasons your dog may want to steal your pillow.\nBaker says canine instincts and pack mentality drive a dog’s desire for closeness. For as many as 12 weeks, your dog slept with their littermates beside their mother. “If you’ve ever woken up completely pinned in place by a furry, snoring lump, you’ve probably asked yourself: ‘Why does my dog insist on sleeping against me?’ Whether they’re curled up at your feet, pressed \tagainst your back, or wedged under your arm like a four-legged teddy bear, this behavior is common — and it’s deeply rooted in a dog’s instincts and emotions.”\nCats might have a reputation for seeking a silk pillow, but dogs crave comfort and security, too. “Unsurprisingly, many dogs prioritize physical comfort in a soft bed with a warm, trusted human next to them,” Reynolds says.\nBonding happens over time with accumulated trust and positive reactions. Colby Julien, a dog behaviorist and dog trainer atGeo-Sniffing, an innovative scent pod discovery game for dogs, provides an example of the bonding that evolved between her husband and her nine-year-old Aussie, Loki. “Loki sleeps with my husband every night even though he’s bonded to me,” Julien says. “Why? Because my husband has severe sleep apnea and snores. Thanks to Loki, he doesn’t need a sleep apnea machine.\nThe moment snoring starts, Loki instinctively gets off his own bed, jumps up, and nudges [my husband] into a side position, preventing him from sleeping on his back. This helps my husband breathe better, get more oxygen to his brain, and improve his sleep quality. It’s like clockwork — Loki recognizes something is wrong and knows exactly how to fix it.”\nIt’s a personal preference, but here are the pros and cons.\nReasons why your dog sleeps against you\nUnderstandingthe effects of sleeping with your dog in bedis important. Reynolds says dogs seek warmth and comfort and demonstrate trust and affection when they sleep against us. However, if signs of anxiety accompany the behavior, it may indicate an underlying health concern.\n“Dogs are naturally drawn to warmth, and your body is the coziest heat source around,” Baker says. “They spent their first eight to 12 weeks with their puppy siblings in a puppy pile, snoozing the day away. This instinct goes back to their wild ancestors, who slept in packs to conserve heat and stay safe from predators.”\nBaker says it’s not just about warmth — dogs areincredibly social creatures. “Sleeping close to their humans is a sign of deep trust and attachment, just like the safety of a puppy pile,” she says. “By pressing against you, they’re reinforcing the bond you share — just like they would with other dogs in a pack. It’s their way of saying, ‘You’re my person, and I feel safe with you.’”\nBaker says for some dogs, snuggling up at night is simply a preference. For others, it may signal something more. “A sudden change in sleeping habits such as increased clinginess or restlessness could indicate an underlying health issue,” she says. “Dogs experiencing pain, anxiety, or discomfort may seek extra reassurance and warmth\" from their pet parents. “If your pup has recently started sleeping against you more than usual, a vet check-up might be in order.”\nBenefits of your dog sleeping against you\nMost pet parents find their dog sleeping against them comforting. “Allowing your dog to sleep in bed with you has its benefits,” says Baker. “It can enhance your emotional connection, provide comfort for anxious dogs, and even help regulate body temperature on chilly nights.”\nDrawbacks of your dog sleeping against you\nAccording to Reynolds, there are potential drawbacks to your dog sleeping against you. Dogs may become possessive and guard their sleeping space. “It is important to note that correlation is not causation,” he says. “It is unlikely that allowing your dog to sleep in your bed would be the sole reason for a behavior problem.”\nBaker agrees there are drawbacks for different reasons. “Some dogs are restless sleepers, meaning you might wake up to kicking paws or loud snores,” she says. “Dirt, allergens, and shedding fur can make their way into your bed, and in rare cases, dogs who become too attached to co-sleeping may struggle with independent rest.”\nJulien says that “experts often discourage allowing dogs to sleep with humans” because “unlike people, dogs don't sleep for eight hours straight. Instead, they cycle through wake and sleep periods.\" While some dogs can sleep soundly through the night, many \"are simply too restless to share the bed.”\nItisso sweet...\nHow to encourage or discourage this behavior\nReynolds advises creating a space where your dog won't be bumped or jostled if you want them to sleep in your bed. \"Portable steps allow dogs to come and go without waking humans,\" he says.\n\"If you want to encourage your pup to snuggle through the night, invite them onto the bed, praise them, and assure them this is a safe space where they belong,\" Baker says.\nOn the other hand, if you don't want your dog in your bed, Reynolds says you can close your bedroom door, train your dog to feel comfortable sleeping in a crate, or provide soft bedding on the floor near where you sleep.\nBaker says positive reinforcement can help guide your dog to their own sleeping area. \"High-reward treats, cozy dog beds, and clear bedtime routines help them understand where they're expected to sleep,\" she says. \"If they persist in climbing into your bed, consistency is key — redirect them each time without giving in, and always keep the process positive. If necessary, bedtime crate training can create a sense of security, turning their crate into their personal 'bedroom.'\"\nSome dogs actually prefer their own space. \"My husky, Gary, never slept with us,\" Baker says. \"No matter how much I begged, he preferred sprawling under the bed on the cool wood floor, living his best independent life.\"\nWhen you should consult a veterinarian\nIf your dog doesn't typically sleep against you but has started, you'll likely want to consult a veterinarian.  \"Always consult a veterinarian if you suspect your dog has a health concern,\" Reynolds says\nReferences\n“Sleeping with Dogs | Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine.”Tufts.edu, 19 Aug. 2021,vet.tufts.edu/news-events/news/sleeping-dogs.‌\n“Sleeping with Dogs | Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine.”Tufts.edu, 19 Aug. 2021,vet.tufts.edu/news-events/news/sleeping-dogs.\n‌",

  },
  "page_content": "Dogs are known to lick a lot of things:the floor, theirlips,themselves. But have you ever caught your dog licking the air like they’re tasting an invisible treat? One second, they’re lounging peacefully; the next, their tongue flickers away at…well, nothing. While an occasional lick is no big deal, excessive air licking can leave many pet parents scratching their heads.\nIs your dog trying to tell you something? Are they channeling their inner lizard? Is this another one of those odd canine quirks?\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nAccording to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), repetitive dog behaviors like air licking can be linked to medical, neurological, or behavioral issues. While some dogs do it harmlessly, others may signal an underlying health concern.\nBefore you chalk it up to another weird dog habit, check out the most common reasons why dogs lick the air and when you should be concerned.\nThe sentiment is nice, but...\nWhy do dogs lick the air?\nDogs don’t lick the air for no reason — there’s a method to their madness. Licking is a natural behavior that helps dogs explore their environment, communicate with humans, and self-soothe. But when licking the air becomes excessive or obsessive, it’s usually a sign something is amiss.\nIf your dog has dental pain, they may lick the air to cope. Gum disease, tooth decay, oral infections, or something as simple as a piece of food stuck between their teeth can make licking feel like temporary relief. Other signs of dental disease or distress include bad breath, excessive drooling, or pawing at their mouth.\nWhat to do:Check your dog’s teeth and gums for redness, swelling, or tartar buildup. If you notice anything unusual (or if your dog's breath smells like a garbage truck), schedule a vet appointment for a professional dental cleaning session.\nStrange as it may sound, air licking can be a mild form of seizure activity, especially in dogs with focal seizures. Unlike full-body seizures, focal seizures affect only certain parts of the brain. They may cause unusual, repetitive behaviors like excessive licking, “fly-biting” (snapping at the air), or sudden, unexplainable staring.\nWhat to do:If your dog frequently licks the air and exhibits other neurological symptoms (twitching, disorientation, or uncontrolled movements), consult a veterinarian. They may recommend tests to rule out epilepsy or other neurological conditions.\nSometimes, a dog licking the air is a sign of gastrointestinal discomfort. Acid reflux, nausea, or an upset stomach can trigger excessive licking as dogs try to cope with the pain. Dogs experiencing digestive problems may lick floors, carpets, or their lips excessively.\nWhat to do:If your dog is licking the air after eating, consider switching to a more digestible diet or feeding them smaller, more frequent meals. A vet appointment is recommended if air licking is paired with loss of appetite, changes in poop texture or color, or vomiting.\nHumans may fidget, bite their nails, or tap their feet when anxious, but dogs can develop nervous habits like licking the air. Separation anxiety, environmental changes, or exposure to loud noises (thunderstorms, fireworks, etc.) can trigger this behavior.\nWhat to do:Try to identify and eliminate stressors. Providing a consistent routine, using calming supplements, or introducing pheromone diffusers can help anxious dogs feel more secure. If anxiety persists, consult a dog behaviorist.\nIn some cases, excessive air licking is compulsive behavior, not just a random quirk. Dogs with compulsive disorders may lick the air obsessively, and others may chase their tails or repeatedly spin in circles. This behavior stems from prolonged stress, boredom, or genetic predisposition.\nWhat to do:Increasing mental and physical stimulation can help. Daily walks, challenging puzzle toys, and interactive play sessions can redirect their focus. A veterinarian or animal behaviorist may suggest behavioral therapy or medication if compulsive licking continues.\nSenior dogs may lick the air due to canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD), the dog equivalent of dementia. As dogs age, their brain function declines, leading to confusion, disorientation, and repetitive behaviors like pacing, staring at walls, or licking the air.\nWhat to do:While CCD can’t be cured, it can be managed. Brain-boosting diets, mental enrichment activities, and medications can help slow cognitive decline. A vet can assess if your dog shows cognitive dysfunction and recommend a treatment plan.\nDogs with allergies or skin irritation sometimes lick the air to relieve itching indirectly. Environmental allergens, food sensitivities, or flea bites can cause excessive licking of paws, the body, or the air. If their skin is itchy or inflamed, air licking may be an attempt to soothe discomfort.\nWhat to do:Check for signs of allergies, such as excessive scratching, red skin, or ear infections. A vet may recommend allergy testing, dietary changes, or antihistamines to help control the itching.\nDogs experience the world through scent, and licking the air can sometimes enhance their ability to process smells. The Jacobson’s organ in a dog’s mouth helps them analyze pheromones and other scent particles. You may notice your dog licking the air after sniffing something intensely — this is their way of getting an even better whiff.\nWhat to do:If the licking happens occasionally when your dog investigates something interesting, there’s nothing to worry about. This behavior is normal.\nA dog licking the air persistently may have something stuck in their mouth, like a piece of toy, splinter, or stray blade of grass. Dogs will flick their tongues repeatedly to dislodge whatever’s causing discomfort.\nWhat to do:Check inside your dog’s mouth for visible foreign objects. If you notice excessive drooling, pawing at their mouth, or difficulty eating, a vet visit may be necessary to remove the obstruction safely.\nWhen should you worry about your dog licking the air and see a vet?\nWhile occasional air licking is typical, you should see a vet or dog behaviorist if:\nBehavior becomes compulsive or excessive.\nBehavior becomes compulsive or excessive.\nAir licking is accompanied by vomiting, weight loss, or lethargy.\nAir licking is accompanied by vomiting, weight loss, or lethargy.\nYour dog shows signs of pain, confusion, or seizures.\nYour dog shows signs of pain, confusion, or seizures.\nThey start licking obsessively after eating, which could indicate acid reflux.\nThey start licking obsessively after eating, which could indicate acid reflux.\nEarly intervention can help address underlying health conditions before they worsen.

Does it occur after meals, during moments of stress, or at random? Keeping a log of their behavior can help your vet pinpoint potential triggers and rule out serious conditions.\nTheir toes might smell like Fritos, but there’s no way they tastethatgood.\nHow to stop your dog from licking the air\nAccording to Dr. Mary Burch, a certified applied animal behaviorist, “Some dogs lick the air when they are happy or excited.” However, if your dog’s behavior becomes problematic, the first thing to do is identify the cause. Whether it’s anxiety, allergies, or dental pain, addressing the root issue is essential.\nProvide mental and physical stimulation.Bored dogs may lick excessively, so ensure they get enough exercise and interactive enrichment.\nProvide mental and physical stimulation.Bored dogs may lick excessively, so ensure they get enough exercise and interactive enrichment.\nKeep your dog’s environment calm.Reduce stress triggers, use calming products, and create a consistent, peaceful routine.\nKeep your dog’s environment calm.Reduce stress triggers, use calming products, and create a consistent, peaceful routine.\nCheck for medical concerns.If the licking is persistent, get a vet’s opinion to address underlying medical problems.\nCheck for medical concerns.If the licking is persistent, get a vet’s opinion to address underlying medical problems.\nDogs lick the air for various reasons, ranging from curiosity to medical conditions. While occasional air licking is harmless, frequent or obsessive licking may signal something more serious. By paying close attention to when and why your dog is licking the air, you can determine whether it’s a quirky habit or if you should contact a vet or dog behaviorist.\nYour dog’s weird quirks make them interesting and unique. However, if their tongue works overtime on invisible peanut butter in the air, it may be time to dig deeper for a reason.\nReferences\n\"Excessive Licking, Chewing, and Grooming in Dogs.\" PetMD, 2021,https://www.petmd.com/dog/general-health/excessive-licking-chewing-and-grooming-dogs\n\"Excessive Licking, Chewing, and Grooming in Dogs.\" PetMD, 2021,https://www.petmd.com/dog/general-health/excessive-licking-chewing-and-grooming-dogs\n\"Why Does My Dog Lick the Air?\" American Kennel Club, 2022,https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/why-does-my-dog-lick-the-air/\n\"Why Does My Dog Lick the Air?\" American Kennel Club, 2022,https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/why-does-my-dog-lick-the-air/",

  },
  "page_content": "We’ve all been there: You walk into a room and find your dog looking adorable, peacefully napping under a sunbeam, and let out a sigh.How are we lucky enough to exist in the same universe?you might wonder. And then, you take a closure look and notice the bizarre position your dog is in — on his back, perhaps, with a paw stuck in the air — and you wonder,How the hell is that comfortable?\nDogs sleep in all kinds of positions, some more logical than others. But what do any of them mean? It turns out, you can learn a lot from how your dog sleeps. Mike Armstrong CPDT-KA, owner and the lead trainer forWoof Works Training, gave us a few tips to better understand our dogs’ favorite naptime formations.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhat does dog's sleeping position tell us?\nUsually, your dog’s favorite snoozing stance can speak to one of three things: their physical comfort, their emotional comfort, or their temperature. You might need context clues to decide which one it is.\nIf your dog likes to rest flopped out on his back, tummy in the air, Armstrong offers two possible scenarios. “My two big interpretations of that are, they’re completely trusting of their surroundings — they are totally fine with everything — [or] … they could be hot and they're trying to cool themselves off,” he says.\nDogs that expose their bellies while at rest are showing vulnerability by leaving their vital organs unprotected. More cautious dogs will shield their abdomens from harm. Then again, if your home is getting a little stuffy in the summertime, you might also find your dog splayed out to cool off.\nYounger dogs, in particular, can be more prone to sleeping on their backs. As they get older, they might switch to a different position that’s easier on their backs and hips.\nThis one’s another classic for dogs who feel at home. If your dog often sleeps on their side, legs outstretched or folded up like little chicken wings, “It generally means they feel pretty relaxed and trusting, comfortable in their surroundings, not threatened, all of that,” Armstrong says.\nNo, your dog is not sleeping on his stomach with his front legs outstretched because he’s developed a newfound interest in Ancient Egypt (although, if you happen to leave the Discovery Channel on a lot, I suppose we’ll never know for sure). Instead, Armstrong says, “That usually means that they feel more alert.”\nThe “Sphinx” pose, also known as the “Lion” pose, could mean that your dog wants to be able to stand up at a moment’s notice. At the same time, Armstrong cautions against reading too much into the position as a surefire sign that your dog feels on edge. “It could certainly mean that,” he says. “But again, some dogs will lay in those positions because it's the most comfortable at that moment.”\nIf you ask me (and sadly, no one has), this one’s actually the cutest pose in the book. Really, how could anything be more adorable than a dog curled up into the tiniest, tightest little ball, tail tucked beneath their chinny-chin-chin?\nDepending on context, Armstrong says, donut-prone doggies could be experiencing a couple different things: They’re either feeling a little self-protective (again, hiding those precious internal organs), or they’re feeling a little chilly. Understandably, this position is particularly popular amongnewly adopted dogswho are still adjusting to their new home.\n“We see that a lot with, especially, dogs who come to do board-and-trains if we haven't done a lot of work with them prior,” Armstrong says. “Our kennel room is different from our training room, and so if they haven't spent a lot of time in there, for example, you'll see them, especially the first few days, in that position.”\nAll dogs are different, so don’t freak out if your dog occasionally likes to transform into a coil. They could be cold or simply comfortable in that position. That said, Armstrong notes, “If your dog is persistently in the donut, I would keep an eye on that.”If you’ve recently adopted a dog who still only sleeps in the “donut” position after a few weeks, it could be a sign that they’re not quite settled in. “If that persisted, then there could be an issue and how they perceive you,” Armstrong says. “They may not feel safe around you because you may not be a calming influence on them.”\nBut this doesn’t mean your relationship has to stay that way. Work onyour bondthrough play,positive reinforcement training(treats always help!), and reading their body language. If you understand their boundaries —like whenthey may not want hugs, snuggles, etc. — they will learn to relax with with you. As cute as the donut may be, if you do these things, and you may just see them uncoil.\nYes, we could also call this the “Superman Pose,” but honestly, where’s the fun in that? For the uninitiated,splootingis when a dog (or other animal — I’ve seen squirrels do it) splays itself on the ground stomach-down with legs extended.\nThis position is popular among younger and older dogs. Puppies sometimes fall asleep in this position, and seniors might favor it because it’s easy on their hips. If it’s hot outside, your dog might also be using the cool floor to cool off his tummy.\nGenerally, Armstrong says, he’d infer that dogs in this position are feeling relaxed. Puppies might also try to use this position to initiate play while awake.\nWhy do some dogs burrow under blankets?\nIf it’s cold outside, there’s always a possibility that your dog just wants to be warm. They could also simply want the comfort and security that comes from sleeping under a big, cozy blanket. As Armstrong puts it, “Some dogs do not want to be under anything, and some will insist on it, even when it’s hot.”\nAs with many other sleep preferences, Armstrong says most pet parents shouldn’t read too much into burrowing behavior. But if your dog refuses to come out or ducks under the covers in response to certain noises, then you might want to explore the behavior further. If it’s fear-based, some gentle training can help your dog overcome it.\nWhen to see a vet\nFor the most part, sleeping positions and behaviors are benign. As strangely as dogs might seem to behavewhen they’re dreaming,all that twitching and light barking is normal and healthy. Armstrong notes that some clients have asked about dogs that like to sleep with their heads propped up on a pillow or surface. This is usually not a cause for alarm, but if you notice labored breathing, it might be worth running by your vet. That way, you and your pet can both rest easy.",

  },
  "page_content": "Often in the morning I hear the bedroom door fling open and see a feathery tail cruise past the foot of the bed like a shark fin. Next thing I know, my Collie mix, Willy, has jumped on the bed and is standing on my body, wagging his tail. He feels like a weighted blanket. His littermate, Lilac, doesn’t do this, so why does he? I take it as a cue to give him attention then get up to let him out.\nSusan Nilson, an accredited behavioral specialist, says my response reinforces Willy’s behavior. Nilson foundedThe Cat and Dog Houseto help pet parents understand their pets’ behavior. She says dogs learn quickly that they’ll get attention if they stand on you. That can be a pat on the head, a laugh or even verbal redirection. “Regardless of what the response is (i.e., positive or negative), it can reinforce the behavior,” she says. “Understanding why your dog stands on you involves considering his unique personality, early learning and life experiences and overall emotional needs.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nIf they’repanting in your faceor their sharp nails are digging into you, it can be annoying when your dog stands on you. Discourage your dog from standing on you by redirecting them to sit next to you or lie on the floor. Give them a reward when they do. Engage in training and obedience to learn cues like “off” or “down” and “leave it” that can accompany redirection. Create inviting spaces for them to relax so they're less likely to stand on you.\nThere are plenty of benefits to teaching your dog this cute trick.\nEight reasons why your dog is standing on you\nDogs often learn that standing on their owner gets a reliable reaction (Willy, we’re looking at you). For example, if a dog receives a scratch behind the ears every time they stand on their owner, Nilson says they’re likely to keep repeating the behavior to get that same reward.\n“Even if you push your dog away, or ask them to get off, in your dog’s eyes that’s still attention so you’re reinforcing the behavior even if you don’t intend to do so,” she says.\nThunderstorms, fireworks, unfamiliar house guests or sudden changes in a dog’s environment will trigger anxiety. “Some dogs stand on their owners as a way of seeking comfort when they feel anxious or scared,” Nilson says. “Studies show that dogs, just like children with their parents, use their owners as a secure base. By maintaining close physical contact it can provide them with a sense of security and safety.”\nPay attention to your dog’s body language; if their ears are down and their tail is tucked, they’re anxious or afraid of something.\nDogs are highly social animals and oftenexpress their affection physically, Nilson says. “Standing on you could simply be a way for your dog to show his affection and maintain that close bond,” she says.\nThat physical connection can also prompt the release of oxytocin in both of you.Oxytocin is sometimes calledthe “cuddle hormone” or “love hormone” because it promotes feelings of happiness, love and connectedness. “So when your dog stands on you, he most likely experiences a boost in those feel-good hormones,” Nilson says. “This positively reinforces his desire to be physically close to you and, again, he's likely to keep repeating the behavior.”\nSome dogs are genetically more protective than others. Some have also been trained to be protective. They instinctively guard precious resources, like food, toys, bones, their bed, and even their pet parents, Nilson says.\n“Certain breeds like German Shepherds and Dobermanns for example, were bred specifically for guarding so may have a natural predisposition to stay close to their owners and protect them,” she says.\nWhat if your dog is snapping and growling at someone else while standing on you? That means your dog is being over-protective. If unchecked, this behavior can escalate and should be addressed by a vet or behaviorist.\nSeparation anxiety is commonin dogs, withstudies reportingthat up to 75 percent of dogs in the United States experience it to some extent, Nilson says. “Dogs with separation anxiety often cling to their owners physically, even when they’re present,” she says. “Standing on you might be part of a wider pattern of behavior that includes following you around or becoming distressed when you’re out of sight, even for just a few seconds.”\nNilson like other vets and behaviorists, says dominance is a debunked myth. “The outdated (and inaccurate) notion of ‘dominance’ in dogs was based on a study of unrelated captive wolves and then erroneously applied to pet dogs. It has since been widely debunked by modern behavioral science, although the myth persists,” she says.  “Your dog standing on you is not a sign he’s trying to ‘dominate’ you or be the ‘alpha’ dog or ‘pack leader.’ Rather, it’s simply rooted in his need for comfort, attention, or connection.”\nDogs will use physical contact to invite play with other dogs. In the “play bow” position, a dog’s butt is in the air, its tail is wagging and its mouth is open. “If your dog is feeling playful or excited, he may jump up, put his front paws on you or even stand in your lap to get your attention and try to initiate a play session,” Nilson says.\nDogs are highly perceptive creatures adept at reading human body language and sensing something is wrong before we know it ourselves. That’s why dogs, with their superior sense of smell, are trained to detect cancer. Cancer cells, even those that have not spread from their initial site, produce a specific odor dogs identify on human breath.\nNilson says dogs sense changes in the people around them. “This includes picking up on cues (via changes in demeanor and behavior) when their owners are unwell,” she says. “If you’re feeling under the weather, your dog might stand on you or lean against you to offer comfort or stay close as a protective gesture.”\nWe’ve heard wild animals retreat if they’re sick or injured. If your dog is sick or in pain, they’re likely to do the same. They might exhibit behaviors like hiding, decreased activity, lethargy, lack of appetite or withdrawal. Others however, Nilson says, may become unusually clingy or irritable (andeven aggressive). “Having said that, some dogs may still seek comfort by staying close or leaning against their owners for reassurance,” she says.\nPro tips for boosting the confidence of a scaredy-cat dog.\nWhat should you do about your dog standing on you?\nGently push them off you with a firm “no” if you don’t want them standing on you. But if your dog is standing on you for attention, and you think it’s cute and give them a scratch, you’ll teach them standing on you yields rewards (like Willy when he wants to go out in the morning).\nLearn your dog’s body language. If their front paws are on your legs, and they’re wagging their tail, they probably want to play. If your dog is persistently standing on you and exhibiting signs of anxiety (tucked tail, furrowed brow,lowered ears) they’re communicating fear or anxiety.\nBottom line\nDogs stand on people to get attention and communicate affection and playfulness.\nDogs stand on people to get attention and communicate affection and playfulness.\nThey also stand on people to seek reassurance when they’re scared, anxious, sick, or injured.\nThey also stand on people to seek reassurance when they’re scared, anxious, sick, or injured.\nGiving your dog attention when they stand on you will reinforce the behavior.\nGiving your dog attention when they stand on you will reinforce the behavior.\nFAQs\nIn general, it’s a good idea to discourage your dog from standing on you. Redirect them withpositive reinforcement,train them to lie or sit next to you instead or ignore them. Turn your body away, don’t make eye contact or reward them with physical interaction.\nIf your dog has learned to stand on you, they may also try to stand on other family members and guests. Not everyone likes this. It can also be dangerous or frightening. If you can’t prevent your dog from standing on guests, you may need to remove them (your dog, not your guests)to a crateor another room.\nIf your dog is standing on you and growling, snapping or exhibiting other hostile behavior, seek advice from a vet or behaviorist. Your dog might be protecting you but aggressive behavior and over-protectiveness can lead to bigger issues and even injury. It can also be a sign of underlying issues such as fear or illness.\nYour dog stands on you because they want attention, they’re anxious, they’re demonstrating affection or they’re feeling playful. They can also stand on you if they’re feeling protective or sense you’re sick.\nA lot of people think it’s cute when their dog stands on them and will reinforce the behavior with exclamations of delight (this might be especially true of people with small dogs). If the behavior is annoying to your or other people in your house, you can train your dog not to stand on you.\nDon’t overreact. Gently and firmly discourage your dog from standing on you by redirecting them to sit next to you or lie on the floor. Offer a favorite treat or reward when they obey.\nReferences\nMary Robins, et al. “Dogs Detecting Disease: Meet America’s Cancer-Sniffing Canines.”American Kennel Club, 25 Mar. 2020,www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/meet-americas-cancer-sniffing-canines/.\nMary Robins, et al. “Dogs Detecting Disease: Meet America’s Cancer-Sniffing Canines.”American Kennel Club, 25 Mar. 2020,www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/meet-americas-cancer-sniffing-canines/.",

  "page_content": "So, you’ve written the perfect song to honor your pet. You’ve found every word that rhymes with “Fluffy,” workshopped the bridge, and sounded out a catchy tune to tie it all together. But do our pets really appreciate when we sing to them, or do these little songs we make up fall into the “more for us than for them” column of pet care?\nIt’s worth asking. After all,TikTok is full of videosof people serenading their dogs.Remember the trending“Good Morning to the Cutie Pie” song? It had commenters wondering if their pups and cats would actually like to hear a daily morning song (or a song about anything). Well, this adorable Maltipooseems pretty intoher mom’s cover of “I Will Always Love You.” Andthis catseems interested, but maybe it’s because her mom is singing Billie Eilish’sBarbieballad in meows, in lieu of English.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nIf you’re convinced your dog pricks their ears up in excited anticipation when you sing or that your cat seems calmer when they hear that special tune, you might be right. Although the research on pets and singing is spotty, the information we do have indicates that our familiars do, at least, seem to appreciate a certain kind of music. If anything, we might want to tweak our original songs (or covers) to better suit their tastes. Here’s what science says (and what it doesn’t) about how pets process our personalized power ballads.\nDo dogs like it when you sing to them?\nLet’s start with pups. Do they actually like to hear our melodic voices, or do they just put up with it? There really is no way to tell definitively, unfortunately. When it comes to dogs, Zachary Silver, professor of psychology and director of theCanine Intelligence Labat Occidental College, says, “We’re not quite sure if they like the melodies or the harmonies that go into music.” That said, he points out, we know that dogs respond positively when weuse our special“pet voice.”\nWe all have it — that higher-pitched tone we use exclusively with our special animals. Singing shares a lot of properties with dog-directed speech, Silver says. “So, while we don’t know for sure if dogs like melodies and the [musical] properties that we think about, certainly they are more likely to pay attention to a human singing than they are to a human just speaking normally.” Do they care for it? Who knows? But they hear you, that’s for sure.\nDo cats like it when you sing to them?\nAlthough there isn’t much research examining how cats feel about their parents singing, there is reason to believe that they can recognize when their parents are speaking to them.\nA2022 studyfound thatcats responded distinctly to the sound of their parents using cat-directed speech. They did not respond when their parents used adult-directed speech (in other words, when they used the voice they normally use when speaking with fellow human adults) or to strangers, regardless of which voice they used. The study also found that catsrespond better to a baby voice, specifically. So, when you say, “Hey, buddy, come get your dinner” in your cutesy voice, they pay attention.\nThat said, Silver notes that evolutionarily, cats never had the same incentive to form working relationships with human communities the way that dogs did — so cats are generally thought to pay less attention to human activities than dogs do. “Dogs are significantly more likely to engage with human speech than cats,” Silver says. “So, I think it is plausible that dogs also are more likely to have a preference toward music than cats.”\nOnce again, however, Silver cautions that that idea is mere conjecture based on what we know about animals’ relationships with speech. “To really answer that question fully, we would need to do experiments that we deliberately look at dogs and cats responding to singing, in particular.” But for now, here’s the takeaway: If your furry mob boss responds to your singing, they may just be responding to a vocalization that sounds like the baby voice you do. In other words, they may tune in because they think you’re going to feed or do something else that will please them immeasurably.\nDo dogs like music?\nOK, so we’ve gone over whether your dog likes the music you make (still up for debate), but do they like music ingeneral? Silver notes that most rigorous, empirical research on canine cognition began only 25 to 30 years ago. Because of this, our science-based understanding of dogs’ inner workings is limited. But while the Beethovens of the dog world might be better known for their drool than for their dazzling compositions, studies do seem to indicate thatyour little geniuscan appreciate a good concerto.\nResearch suggeststhat dogs have a sense of pitch and may behave differently when listening to one genre of music versus another. One2012 study, for instance, found thatclassical music seemed to calm shelter dogsmore than pop or heavy metal based on physiological factors, like heart rate andcortisol levelsfound in saliva. Fascinatingly, however, audiobooks performed even better — so while your dog might prefer Chopin to Chappell Roan,War and Peacecould be an even better choice of background noise to play at home while you run errands. Even more interesting, amore recent studyfound that reggae and soft rock produced more profound effects than classical music and that rotating between genres helped boost results as well.\nSilver offers a couple possible reasons for dogs’ music appreciation. Dogs might be fascinated by music like any unfamiliar sound, and it’s also possible that they’ve grown more attuned to it across generations as away to bond with humans.\n“Anecdotally, I’ve had a lot of people tell me that their dogs really enjoy when they play music on an instrument,” Silver says. “I think that part of this could be a novelty effect. It’s just something that they’re not used to hearing.”\nOne could also argue that dogs have evolved over time to be more responsive to music based on its implications for their survival. Silver points out that historically, the dogs who socialized best with humans would have been the most likely to continue breeding over time. Perhaps, he suggests, some dogs realized that humans who were engaged in making or enjoying music were more likely to share food and form social bonds.\n“Unfortunately, we just don’t have great, concrete answers to that,” Silver says. “So, all we can rely on right now is the accumulation of individual anecdotes.”\nWe know thatdogs howl to communicate. Whether your dog likes to “sing” along to music orwail at passing ambulances, they are trying to tell someone… something. Some breeds howl more than others, and the motivation behind the moaning can vary from expressing pain or fear, to joining a chorus, to crying out for attention. Whatever your dog is howling at, the simplest answer behind the “why” is that they were simply programmed to do it.\nDo cats like music?\nIn news that will likely surprise exactly no one, research suggests that cats might be pickier than dogs. A2019 study publishedin the ​​Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgeryfound that while music composed specifically for cats successfully calmed subjects in a veterinary clinic setting, classical music failed to produce the same effect. In 2015, however, aseparate experimentpublished in the same journal found that classical music successfully calmed cats during surgery, outperforming both pop and heavy metal (surprise, surprise).\nTaken together, these studies suggest that music can positively impact cats’ moods. That said, both experiments were relatively small — the first examined 20 subjects, while the second included only 12 — so more robust research could scratch further below the surface.\nSo, what should you do? Keep singing to your pets? Definitely. Keep playing them music when you leave the house? If that’s your routine, why not? It’s not like they’re running away screaming (or maybe they are). But if they don’t like it, they can leave the room. After all,they are more like usthanwild animals these days.\nReferences\nCrawford, Amy. “Why Dogs Are More like Humans than Wolves.”Smithsonian Magazine,www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/why-dogs-are-more-like-humans-than-wolves-22095590/.\nCrawford, Amy. “Why Dogs Are More like Humans than Wolves.”Smithsonian Magazine,www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/why-dogs-are-more-like-humans-than-wolves-22095590/.\n“Do Dogs Have a Musical Sense?”Psychology Today,www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/canine-corner/201204/do-dogs-have-musical-sense.\n“Do Dogs Have a Musical Sense?”Psychology Today,www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/canine-corner/201204/do-dogs-have-musical-sense.\nLewis, Tanya. “Your Cats Can Tell When You’re Speaking to Them.”Scientific American,www.scientificamerican.com/article/your-cats-can-tell-when-youre-speaking-to-them/.\nLewis, Tanya. “Your Cats Can Tell When You’re Speaking to Them.”Scientific American,www.scientificamerican.com/article/your-cats-can-tell-when-youre-speaking-to-them/.\nStout, David. “Science Has Found out What Music Your Cat Should Be Chilling to While Being Neutered.”TIME, Time, 31 Mar. 2015,time.com/3764866/cats-surgery-classical-music/.

  "page_content": "If you’ve ever noticed your dog’s teeth chattering, it may not be because they’re cold. This behavior is actually common not just in dogs but in cats and other animals as well. And while it can be a reaction to icy temperatures, chattering teeth can also be an expression of pain or even a response to a specific smell in the environment.\nPerhapseven stranger: Your dog’s teeth might be chattering because they’re… happy? Dogs tend to use body language to express emotion to their human caretakers, and sometimes they show excitement in rather strange ways.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\n“Excited dogs often show physical signs like jumping, spinning, tail wagging, or barking,” dog behavior expert and trainerShelby Semelsays. “Their eyes may appear bright, their ears perked, and their body might seem tense with energy. Teeth-chattering, though less common, is another behavior that can occur when a dog is highly stimulated, such as during play or when anticipating a treat.”\nRead on to learn about seven signs of excitement in dogs and how to teach your pup to chill.\nYou’re happy to see them, too. But you’d be even happier if they didn’t create a mess.\nSigns of excitement in dogs\nDogs tend to have the emotional capacity of human toddlers but far fewer ways of expressing their feelings, whether fear, excitement, or anger. Because your dog can’t verbally tell you how they’re feeling, it’s important to learn how your dog expresses emotion —and excitement— so you can better understand them.\nWhen your dog feels excited, adrenaline floods their body, which can result in behaviors like teeth chattering. If this happens during exciting situations, your dog is likely experiencing positive emotions — they just don’t know how to express it! For a dog, chattering teeth is usually a sign of strong feelings, such as happiness or fear. Pay attention to your pup’s body language to understand what this behavior means.\n“Teeth chattering during excitement is often a harmless expression of heightened emotion,” Semel says. “It can occur when dogs are thrilled to see their favorite person, smell something intriguing, or anticipate a fun activity. This behavior is linked to their sensory system, allowing them to better process scents and stimuli in their environment. If chattering happens frequently or outside of exciting moments, it’s worth discussing with your vet to rule out dental or neurological issues.”\nWhile we tend to associate coughing with illness, your dog’s cough isn’t always necessarily acause for concern. If your dog coughs when they are excited, but not at any other time, and they don’t seem to be in any pain or discomfort, you can probably skip a trip to the vet. Coughing in dogs can be a result of anxiety or excitement. If you’re concerned about this behavior, work on training your dog to remain calm or talk to a veterinary behaviorist about dealing with overexcitement.\nIf your dog gets excited and jumps on people who come into your home, this may simply be their way of expressing their joy at seeing a new or favorite person. A dog jumps when excited or bounces to express their happiness. They may even wag their tail or cheerfully bark as well. Cute as this behavior can be, it can also quickly turn overwhelming, especially for your guests. Fortunately, there are steps you can take, like teaching self-control, totrain your dog not to jump.\nDogs often seem to smile when they’re happy, softly opening and turning up the corners of their mouths. In some cases, they even show teeth (non-aggressively, of course) or let their tongue hang out. Many experts believe that dogs “smile” tomimic human behavior— and to appease their human parents.\nSome dogs, especially puppies,pee when they’re excitedor hyper. Many outgrow this behavior as they age out of the puppy stage and calm down. However, if your dog pees when excited, you may need to work on controlling this habit before it becomes a bigger problem. If you’re looking for how to stop a dog from peeing when excited, start with more frequent walks to help encourage them to go outside. You can also work on training your dog to relax and remain calm when exciting things happen.\nIf your dogsneezes when excited, it likely isn’t a cause for concern. Dogs may exhale forcefully in a shallow sneeze in the middle of playtime or just when they’re having fun. Think of this noise as your dog’s version of laughter. You only need to worry about your dog’s sneezing if it’s accompanied by other symptoms, such as shortness of breath or a bloody nose.\nSmall bites are more common in puppies than adult dogs, but it’s still a behavior you want to avoid, especially if your dog nips at guests or other animals. Because dogs don’t have hands, they often use their mouths to interact with others, which can include your dog nipping when excited. If your puppy doesn’t grow out of this behavior, consider enlisting the help of a certified dog behaviorist.\nExpert advice for people with dogs who jump, bark, and generally go nuts when people come over.\nHow to teach a dog not to get so excited\nManaging your reactions to yourdog’s overexcited behavioris the first step in helping them to stay calm. Ignore the unwanted behavior and don’t give your dog any attention when they jump, bark, and act too excited.\n“Consistency is key!” Semel emphasizes. “Ignoring unwanted behaviors, like jumping, and redirecting your dog’s energy toward more desirable actions — such as sitting or staying — can help. Reinforce calm behavior with praise or treats.\nProviding ample mental and physical exercise also reduces pent-up energy that can lead to overexcitement. In more challenging cases, working with a professional trainer can provide a structured approach to managing your dog’s excitement levels.”\nHave a plan forwhen someone arrivesat your home. Make sure to stay calm yourself and keep your dog on a leash until they’ve learned to stay calm when someone visits. Move slowly and calmly and set clear expectations for your dog’s behavior. Remember, patience and consistency arekey.\nObedience training is essential for every dog and can even help avoid overexcitement. Work with your dog to learn commands like “sit,” “stay,“ and “down“ and practice on a daily basis. Once your dog knows these basic commands in a calm environment, work on obedience in environments and situations that might excite them.\nWhenever your dog behaves calmly, make sure to reward them. While a high-value treat can work, the reward doesn’t have to be food. Praise, petting, playtime, or even a favorite toy can all serve as rewards for your dog when they’re on their best (and calmest) behavior.\nJust as certain aromas can be calming to humans,scents like vanillaand lavender can have apotentially soothing effecton your dog. Ask your veterinarian about what scents may work best for helping to calm your pup down.\nTake time to familiarize your dog with a variety of environments and people. Eventually, they’ll become accustomed to situations that would normally make them feel overexcited. Don’t forget to reward your dog for exhibiting calm behavior!\nReferences\nMulroy, Clare. “Can Dogs Smile?

  },
  "page_content": "Any dog parent can attest to their pup engaging in behavior that can best be described as…just plain weird. Whether it’s barking at nothing,fixating on another dog, or staring at the wall, dogs often exhibitbehaviors that seem oddto their human parents. Often, these behaviors are normal or have some clear reason behind them, if you can just sort it out. But in some cases, unusual behavior from your dog can be a sign of an underlying issue.\nIf your dog persists in staring at a blank wall, it could be a symptom of a medical issue, like confusion or senility in older dogs or a seizure disorder. Or your dog could have developed this behavior over time and just can’t seem to stop.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n“Dogs may stare at walls for several reasons,” dog behavior expert and trainerShelby Semelsays. “It could be a sign of cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS), particularly in senior dogs, as they may feel disoriented or confused. Alternatively, they might hear or smell something inside the wall—dogs’ senses are far more acute than ours. In some cases, wall-staring might indicate a neurological condition like a seizure or a compulsive behavior. If you notice this behavior frequently, it's worth documenting when it happens and consulting your veterinarian to rule out any serious underlying issues.”\nTurns out they’re not daydreaming after all.\nIs my dog bored?\nHow do I know if my dog is bored? It’s always a possibility that your dog is simply bored, especially if they don’t have much to do during the day. Make sure your dog has plenty of physical and mental stimulation, like interactive toys, to keep them busy when you’re away. Otherwise, they may resort to behavior like staring at the wall simply to pass the time.\n“Bored dogs often ‘make their own fun,’ which might look like chewing on furniture, excessive digging, or tipping over trash cans,” Semel says. “You might also notice behaviors like restlessness, excessive barking, or constantly seeking your attention. Sometimes, boredom is confused with separation anxiety, so it’s helpful to observe when the behavior occurs and under what circumstances. To combat boredom, consider mental enrichment activities like puzzle toys, scavenger hunts, or training sessions.”\nWhy does my dog stare at the wall?\nMy dog sits and stares at the wall. Are they OK?\nThere are a number of reasons why a dog may spend time staring at the wall, from behavior issues to medical concerns. And unfortunately, some of them are definitely cause for worry.\nCognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS)in dogs is similar to Alzheimer’s in humans. Just like us, when dogs grow older, they maygrow more senileand struggle to remember learned behaviors, like potty training. Dog dementia presents in different ways, so if you suspect your dog has declined cognitive function, visit your vet for a diagnosis. They can help manage symptoms by prescribing medications, as well as recommend strategies to help you deal with changes in your senior dog’s behavior.\nWe tend to think of seizures (in both dogs and humans) as dramatic, but often they present withquieter symptoms, like staring at a wall. This sort of behavior could be the result of a partial orfocal seizure, which are harder to diagnose. While seizures in dogs can be a result of cancer or epilepsy, in many cases, they can be managed with medication.\nOn the less frightening end of the spectrum, your dog could simply stare at a wall as an attention-seeking behavior. Think about whether you’ve regularly given your dog attention when they stare at a wall. For example, if you have a dog camera that dispenses treats mounted on the wall, your dog may simply be looking for a snack.\nStaring could also be acompulsive behavior. Just like compulsive disorders in humans, dogs can engage in behaviors that don’t result in attention or reward, like spinning, tail biting, chewing, or barking. Any compulsive behavior can grow worse over time, so make sure to mention it to your vet.\nDoes my dog hear or see something?\nIt’s no secret that dogs havewaybetter hearingthan humans, and someaspects of their sightare better too, althoughnot color vision. Dogs seelimited colorsand most easily perceiveyellow and blue, which lessens the chances that they’ll notice something out of the ordinary by sight.\nYour dog may be picking up on a noise that you simply can’t hear, like insects or other critters scurrying inside the walls of your house. Pay attention to your dog’s body language and look for signs of anxiety, likeholding their ears back, as well astheir facial expressions.\nInstead of lamenting to yourself,Well, my dog just stares at the wall, sit down next to your dog and listen quietly. You may even want to press your own ear against the wall and see if you can detect any noise. If you suspect there may be some sort of infestation, contact an exterminator to investigate.\nWhatabout ghosts? Can dogs perceive the paranormal? While some pet parents believe that animals are more sensitive to unseen spirits, there’s no evidence to back this idea up. So, instead of worrying about hauntings, contact your vet if you’re concerned about your dog’s unusual staring behavior.\nBeyond the fact that they’re your biggest admirer.\nIf you catch your dog staring at the wall, don’t panic! This behavior doesn’t necessarily mean that your dog has a severe condition like a seizure disorder or cancer. Monitor the behavior, and if you notice your dog staring at walls more often or other changes in behavior, contact your vet to get their opinion. In most cases, this behavior is the result of a treatable health condition, but it’s still important to take the symptom seriously, for your pet’s sake and your own peace of mind.\n“While an occasional glance at the wall might be harmless curiosity, consistent or prolonged wall-staring should prompt closer observation,” Semel says. “It can sometimes indicate serious medical issues, including seizures or cognitive decline. If your dog seems otherwise healthy, you might first investigate potential environmental triggers like pests in the walls. However, if the behavior persists or is accompanied by other signs, consulting your vet is the safest course of action.”\nReferences\n“Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (CDS) | Indoor Pet Initiative.” 2019,indoorpet.osu.edu/dogs/aging_pets/cds.\n“Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (CDS) | Indoor Pet Initiative.” 2019,indoorpet.osu.edu/dogs/aging_pets/cds.\n“Dr. P’s Dog Training: Canine Vision.”www4.uwsp.edu/psych/dog/LA/DrP4.htm.

  "page_content": "We dog parents can be forgiven foranthropomorphizing our beloved pets—that is, ascribing emotions to them that might not be entirely accurate. Those woeful looks tug at our heartstrings and lead to concern.  Dogs have strong eyebrow muscles that make them expressive but if your dog is truly sad, look beyond those puppy dog eyes for lethargy, a change in appetite and other behavioral shifts.\n“Since dogs can’t voice discomfort, it often shows in their behavior,” says Steve Scott, a certified dog trainer, behaviorist and owner ofScott’s K9. Scott pursued a career in law enforcement after his service in the Army and earned honors as the head trainer of his police department’s K9 Unit. He now provides family protection dogs for clients nationwide.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nSome dogs simply look more sad than others, says Colby Julien, a dog behaviorist and dog trainer atGeo-Sniffing, an outdoor scent pod discovery game for dogs. Sad-looking eyes can be genetic in some dogs and can even be advantageous. “This is because sad-looking dogs get the most treats and attention,” Julien says. “Wolves evolved to be more appealing to humans, which is why puppies have big eyes like babies. Their large, round eyes and ability to raise their inner eyebrows mimic human babies’ expressions of sadness, triggering our instinct to care for them.”\nOr are they just peacefully resting? Behaviorist Karen London explains how to tell the difference.\nCommon reasons your dog may look sad\nHealth issues like physical discomfort,pain and chronic illnesscan be underlying issues of a sad expression. Scott says an ongoing health issue such as arthritis will affect mood. He says if you notice your dog is withdrawn, sluggish or avoiding activities they used to enjoy, this might be a sign they’re dealing with physical discomfort or injury.\nOther signs are accidents in the house, destructive behavior, excessive clinginess or nighttime restlessness. Dental issues are another underlying cause of depression. Dogs are stoic creatures. Older dogs who are more prone to health issues should be examined if the concerning behavior persists. If you suspect a health problem, consult your veterinarian.\nDogs are creatures of habit. Scott says for some dogs, changes in routine can lead to anxiety and stress. “This can include small changes like noise, or large changes such as loss of another pet or family member. Behaviors like pacing or whining, as well as a lack of appetite can be a sign your dog is feeling unsettled,” he says.\nIt’s a testament to the growing awareness of human mental health that we now considerdogs may get depressed, too. First, rule out underlying health issues with your veterinarian. Then, if you think there’s another reason your dog is acting withdrawn, experiment with caring gestures to boost your dog’s mood. Engage in an extra grooming session, go for a long walk and let them sniff all they want, or get them a new toy. Remember, dogs feel grief, too.\nSometimes it’syoursadness that triggers your dog’s sad expression. Dogs are sensitive, highly intuitive creatures whopick up on your sadness. They may sit beside you, try to lick you, nudge you or give you uncanny looks of understanding. Thank them when they do. And never direct your strong emotions at them. That makes your dog look sad because they’re trying to appease you and avoid conflict.\n“Many people mistakenly believe that this ‘sad’ look means the dog feels guilty for doing something wrong but in reality, it is a learned response trying to prevent conflict, not an expression of guilt,” Julien says. “This is usually triggered by a human facial expression, yelling or anger. The best way to avoid this behavior is to check your own behavior that’s causing this appeasement behavior.”\nChange is a big destabilizer for all of us. Moving to a new home, introducing a new family member or a new pet affects your dog’s emotional state, Scott says. “Proper training and structure can help alleviate behavior issues associated with environmental changes,” he says.\nOther changes might include the death of a family member or another pet, a child going to college and divorce. Just like us, dogs experience emotion surrounding change. If the change in environment is something you can plan for, try to be extra disciplined about feeding, exercise and training or bonding time before and after the change so your dog can rely on that routine amid the upheaval.\nChanges in the natural environment, especially thunderstorms, are another cause of stress and sadness in dogs. My dog Lilac seems to become more sad and anxious during high wind events while her littermate, Willy, hides under the bathroom sink during thunderstorms. In both cases, I try to soothe them and offer them treats and distraction.\nWilly reminds me with a sad expression that he’s disappointed if I postpone his morning walk. He’ll follow me around with a dejected look until I tell him it’s time to go out, then he’s exuberant. Scott says dogsneedphysical activity and mental engagement. “If your dog isn’t getting enough exercise, they may feel restless or bored, which can come across as sadness,” he says.\nDogs also thrive on companionship. If they’re left for long periods of time without company or an activity like a puzzle feeder, they’ll become despondent. “Being left alone for long hours without interaction can lead to emotional withdrawal,” Scott says.\nWilly’s fortunate to have Lilac for company and me working at home but when no one’s home for most of the day, I’ll hire a dog sitter or ask a friend to let them out.\nHow to help your dog when they’re sad\nEnsure physical health:The first stop in troubleshooting your dog’s sad expression is checking their physical health. Scott says rule out health problems and consult your vet if you think something is physically wrong. Health issues are often the cause of persistent sad behavior.\nEnsure physical health:The first stop in troubleshooting your dog’s sad expression is checking their physical health.

It might mean your dog is angling for a treat. Maybe they heard the crinkle of a bag that sounded like it should contain treats but didn’t. Or maybe it’s something more serious like a health issue, which is usually accompanied by changes in appetite and activity.\nA big change in a dog’s home environment like the death of another pet or a family member brings down the mood of the everyone in the household. A growing body of research shows dogs are very responsive to the sadness and tears of people around them (as if we dog parents didn’t already know that).\nFAQs\nDogs can look sad for a number of reasons including health issues, a change in their environment, a lack of exercise and socialization or even because they’re picking up on your sadness.\nTry distracting them with a walk, a treat, or something they enjoy like a trip to the dog park.\nIf your pup normally bounces to the door at the suggestion of a walk but now remains on the floor with their nose between their paws or turns away from a treat with a doleful expression, it’s wise to consult your veterinarian.\nGenerally, no. Dogs look sad because, like us, they experience a range of emotions. Your dog may be ready for attention or a walk. If that doesn’t change their mood though, look for other behavioral changes that indicate a health issue, stress, or anxiety.\nChanges in a dog’s environment (think moving or the arrival of a squalling new family member) will confuse them and make them appear sad. The same change may also mean they’re getting less attention. Try sticking to a predictable routine and getting them out more or enlist someone to help you. Maybe your dog is picking up onyoursadness. In that case, building in time for extra walks and bonding will help you both.\nYes, dogs can experience depression. A change in routine, the loss of another pet and the departure or death of a close family member can all make a dog withdrawn. Like us, they need to grieve and adjust. Try perking them up with novel treats, activities and exercise.\nReferences\n“Anxious Behavior: How to Help Your Dog Cope with Unsettling Situations.”Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, 3 Aug. 2022,www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/riney-canine-health-center/canine-health-information/anxious-behavior-how-help-your-dog-cope-unsettling-situations.\n“Anxious Behavior: How to Help Your Dog Cope with Unsettling Situations.”Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, 3 Aug. 2022,www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/riney-canine-health-center/canine-health-information/anxious-behavior-how-help-your-dog-cope-unsettling-situations.",

  "page_content": "Certain dog breeds — the German Shepherd, for example — have a reputation for excelling at working tasks. On the other hand, the Pomeranians and Chihuahuas of the world seem built for lives of lazy luxury. For decades, many people have held the belief that dogs can be breed to inherit certain genetic skills, like the advanced scent detection that crime-busting German Shepherds are famous for. As it turns out, that’s a bit of a myth — or maybe just a classic case of human hubris.\nAnew studypublished inScience Advancesfound that, when it comes to skull shape, dog breeds don’t have significant physical differences that give them ability advantages. In other words, we didn’t successfully breed dogs to physically excel at scent or biting tasks.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nThe study\nUsing 3D reconstruction techniques, researchers analyzed the skull shapes of 117 dogs. Forty domestic dog breeds were represented.\nWhile skull shapes varied in some ways across different breeds, the components of the nose and skull related to scent and biting functions were remarkably similar. There was no evidence that skull shape contributed to a dog’s ability to perform functional tasks; for example, dogs specifically bred to have stronger bites did not show different bite-force measurements.\n“In the past 200 years, humans have created hundreds of dog breeds that look really different and are pretty specialized at some tasks like herding, protecting, and detecting odors,” Lindsay Waldrop, a co-author of the study,told Phys.org.“We have assumed that these dogs look different because they are ‘structurally’ specialized at these tasks, but our study shows that, at least for their skulls, they ‘are not’ specialized for tasks that involve the skull, such as biting tasks and scent work.\nBrachycephalic breedssuch as Bulldogs and Pugs were an exception. Humans did breed brachycephalic pups to have shortened snouts. Notably, these breeds weren’t specially bred for any task specialization, but simply due to aesthetic preferences.\nDebunking stereotypes\nThe new research finds that dogs’ personalities and behavioral training are the keys to their advanced skills — not their breed. Physical traits alone can’t predict how well a dog will excel at a task. Humans bred dogs tolookvery different, but those changes didn’t translate to functional advantages.\nThe study also debunks the idea that certain breeds, such asthe much maligned Pit Bull,are more dangerous due to their bite strength. “There are many news stories about dogs attacking people badly and often there are specific breeds that are targets of this reporting (such as Pit Bulls),” Waldrop toldPhys.org. “Some people claim that these dogs will bite harder than other dogs of the same size, or they have special features like ‘locking jaws’ that make them especially dangerous to people. Our study shows that this is simply not true; dogs bred to bite things aren’t structurally different than dogs that have bred to do other things.”",

  },
  "page_content": "Dogs stretch for many reasons, most of which are completely normal. They might wag, stretch, and look up at you expectantly, meaning they want to play. They’ll yawn and stretch to release muscle tension first thing in the morning and when they get up from a nap. Dogs also yawn and stretch after eating, exercising, and performing other activities throughout the day. If the stretch is accompanied by a butt wiggle, all the better.\nQiai Chong foundedPet Coach Singaporeand is the country’s first dog behaviorist with a master’s degree in applied animal behavior and animal welfare. Chong points to several reasons a dog may stretch: self-soothing, releasing muscle tension or discomfort, and oftentimes pandiculation — a fancy word for stretching and yawning at the same.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n“Similar to humans, dogs engage in pandiculation, which combines stretching and yawning, especially after periods of rest,”Webster Cheong, head coach at Pet Coach Singapore, says. “This instinctive behavior helps reset their muscular and nervous systems, preparing them for activity. Pandiculation is an essential part of a dog’s natural routine, particularly after sleeping or prolonged inactivity. The stretch itself may not necessarily feel good. What feels good is after the stretch, like with humans.”\nNo, it’s not always about getting in a good stretch.\nReasons why dogs stretch\nThere are six main reasons — ranging from perfectly normal to those requiring a vet visit — why your dog may be stretching.\nDr. Gabre Denton, pet trainer and veterinary care expert, says if your dog stretches into a play bow — front legs down, butt up — they’re probably inviting you to play. “They might do this as soon as you come in the door. “It’s their way of saying, ‘Let’s go!’” Denton says.\nThisplay signalcan be directed at you or another dog. It’s a non-threatening gesture that conveys peaceful intentions. You might notice it when dogs meet each other for the first time. Usually, it’s accompanied by an open mouth, wagging tail, and comical butt dance. When you see this type of stretch, jump into a play session if you can, because your dog’s in the mood for fun. They’ll bounce around like maniacs, resuming the play bow at intervals to let you know they’re ecstatic.\nIf your dog keeps stretching and yawning, they may need to release some energy. Like humans, all dogs need daily exercise. Some need more than others depending on their breed and age, but consider it necessary for both of you to walk at least once a day. Denton says dogs stretch to loosen up, especially if they’ve been lying around too much. “If yours is stretching a lot, they might need more walks or playtime,” he says.\nCheong, who specializes in canine fitness, says dogs stretch instinctively to relieve muscle tension or discomfort, much like humans stretch to ease tightness. “This is particularly noticeable after vigorous exercise or prolonged inactivity, helping dogs regain comfort and mobility,” he says. “Stretching in this context serves as a functional way to prepare their muscles for movement or relaxation after physical strain.”\nExercise prompts instinctive stretching that supports muscle flexibility and enhances blood circulation. “This helps maintain a healthy range of motion and prevents stiffness,” he says.\nIf your dog goes long periods of time between walks and bouts of activity, set up an indoor environment with distractions, such as a puzzle feeder at the top of the stairs, a doggie door to an enclosed outdoor yard, a stuffed Kong, or a long-lasting chew toy. Some dog parents swear by TV for dogs with outdoor scenes and relaxing music.\nJoint pain and arthritisbecome common as dogs age, and occur even sooner in dogs who are overweight or have orthopedic conditions. If you suspect your dog is stretching more due tojoint pain, look for accompanying behavior such as decreased energy levels, stiffness and difficulty climbing stairs, jumping on furniture and getting in the car, increased panting, and limping. “Frequent stretching, especially with stiffness or hesitation to move, can mean achy joints. Arthritis or early joint issues could be at play,” Denton says.\nYour vet can check for pain and swelling, assess mobility, and take X-rays to diagnose arthritis and joint disease. Fortunately, there are a lot of options fordog arthritis pain management. Your vet may prescribe medication to treat joint pain and recommend joint injections or supplements such as fish oilor glucosamine. At home, spend time outdoors in the sun to stimulate the production of Vitamin D. Go for more frequent, shorter walks and learn tostretch-massage your dogto keep muscles supple and boost circulation.\nA dog stretching into a prayer position (front down, bottom up) could be trying to ease belly discomfort, Denton says. Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), also known as bloat or twisted stomach, is a very serious condition in dogs that can result in death. It occurs primarily in large, deep-chested dogs. Look for stretching accompanied by gagging and retching, a visibly distended stomach that’s tender to the touch, shock, and difficulty breathing. Call your vet immediately if you see any of these signs. “If they seem restless, bloated, or in pain, it’s worth a vet visit,” Denton says.\nDogs vomit for all sorts of reasons that can be innocuous (like snacking on grass), but this can also mean something is seriously wrong. If your dog is stretching a lotandvomiting, refusing food, and looking really uncomfortable, Denton says theycould have pancreatitis. “That needs quick vet care,” he says.\nThe pancreas is a vital organ on the right side of the abdomen that produces enzymes to help digest food as well as hormones (such as insulin) to regulate blood sugar and glucose metabolism. Pancreatitis occurs when the pancreas becomes inflamed. It’s common in dogs and doesn’t account for age, sex, or breed. It can be acute or chronic, and it’s often — but not always — caused by a dog eating a lot of high-fat food at once (so don’t ever leave out that pan of Thanksgiving turkey drippings where your dog can reach it).\nDenton says sometimes a stretch is just a stretch — or a sign your dog needs something to do. “If they’re stretching a ton but seem fine, try adding more play or mental stimulation,” he says.\nBoredom creates stressbecause dogs lacking exercise and mental stimulation can become anxious. Look for stretching accompaniedby yawning, which is a subtle early sign of stress. Just like the dog who needs more exercise (see above), a bored dog needs distractions such asenrichment toys, a stuffed Kong, or long-lasting chew toys. Chong says dogs may stretch as a self-soothing behavior in response to stress or anxiety.\n“While less common than other stress-related signals like yawning, lip licking, or shaking off, stretching can still be an indicator of discomfort,” she says. “If your dog typically does not stretch often but begins doing so in response to a specific stimulus, it may be a subtle sign of stress. This change in behavior should not be overlooked, as it may provide valuable insight into your dog’s emotional state.”\nHelp your dog stay fit and flexible with these stretch techniques by a certified pet strength and conditioning specialist.\nWhen to seek expert help\nIf frequent stretching is accompanied by dramatic symptoms, call your vet immediately. These signs may include vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, abdominal tenderness, fever, and signs of shock.\nBottom line\nStretching is mostly an innocuous way for dogs to release muscle tension when they get up from a nap. Pandiculation, or stretching and yawning at the same time, helps them reset their nervous system.\nStretching is mostly an innocuous way for dogs to release muscle tension when they get up from a nap.

  "page_content": "From an early age, we’re given choices: Do we want the red toy or the blue one? Do we want apple juice or orange?BlueyorPaw Patrol? Even when this leads to toddler tantrums — especially when we want the pink toy, and that wasn’t one of the offerings — it teaches us that we have autonomy. We are our own people. Guess what? We can give that same sense of independence to our pups.\nBeing able to make choices can benefit dogs in so many ways. This can be as simple as presenting them options: you can hold up two toys and see which one they take, or put a treat in each hand and whichever hand they sniff opens up to give them what they selected. Another way to give them a choice is to follow their lead without interrupting them — follow the way they go on a walk without encouraging them to go in a particular direction or let them sniff for as long as they want without hurrying them along. Other opportunities for choices can be given by having multiple options available (beds, couches, rooms, and people) and simply letting them be when they make a choice about where to spend their time.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHaving agency gives them a sense of control over their environment. When dogs interact with their surroundings in their own way, they are gathering knowledge and improving skills to use in the future. They become better-behaved dogs simply by having the ability tochoose. Here’s how.\nThey are more actively engaged with what’s around them.\nIf animals are given agency, they tend to approach the world with the excitement of possibilities about what they can do in each new place they visit. They tend to act in an exploratory and flexible way. If they aren’t given agency, they tend to be concerned about what will happen to them and aremore likely to be reactive,withdraw, and act in an inflexible way. Dogs who have control over their lives (to a degree; let’s not get wild!) are more actively engaged in what’s around them.\nThey are less stressed out.\nA major factor that causesstress in pupsis a lack of control. Dogs who have choices feel more power over their environment. In some ways, that may be obvious. If they are able to choose where to go on a walk, they canavoid things that bother them, such as lawnmowers or another dog barking in a neighbor’s yard.\nIn other cases, the advantage may be more subtle. They are free toinvestigate smellsthat their humans are totally unaware of or explore something new. Uncertainty leads to stress; control alleviates it, and that is good for their health.\nThey have better lives overall (and so will you).\nA dog who gets to make choices will be able to enjoy life more, because they get to do more of what they want, when they want. Making choices also adds mental stimulation andenrichment to their livesbecause of the work involved in actively choosing. They learn from their choices, and that can add to their confidence.\nThey are less likely to experience frustration because they are not constantly being prevented from doing what they want to do. For example, if you give them the choice between astuffed Kongor apuzzle toy, they get what they want, and you won’t have to hear their exasperated whines or barks. (Although, when it comes to that example, they may want both!) These dogs alsowon’t be bored, because they have the freedom to engage in activities that they find interesting, not just what youthinkthey might like.\nThey’ll have better relationships with their pet parents.\nGiving our dogs options gives them a way to tell us what they prefer. Then, we can respond by offering them what they want in the future. With responsive communication, they’ll be less frustrated.\nA more collaborative approach to adventures, as well as in daily life,improves relationships. It’s easier on us, too, to know that we are doing what appeals to our dogs. Understanding each other is always good for our relationship, so honoring their choices improves our bond.\nIf they prefer one type oftraining treatover another, we can offer them the one they like best, and that makes them happier and makes training more effective. If we learn which way they would like to go on a walk, we know their preferred route and can act accordingly. When we know where they want to sleep or which type ofdog bedthey choose, we can offer them the best, most comfortable options. This makes it easier for us to be better parents to them.\nIt comes down to this: When dogs have the opportunity to make choices, that freedom doesso muchfor them. They are likely to be more confident and to feel closer to their pet parents as a result. Most of all, they are going to enjoy their lives more, which is all most of us really want for our kids, erm, dogs.\nReferences\nAgency and the Calibration of Motivated Behavior\nAgency and the Calibration of Motivated Behavior",

Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat does it mean when a dog imprints?\nImprinting, or bonding, occurs when a dog develops a trusting, dependent, and close attachment to a human or other animal. It often happens at a young age, but can occur at various stages in life. Rather than love at first sight, it’s a process that takes time. Imprinting can lead to a strong attachment, which may have both positive and potentially distressing aspects to it.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\n10 signs your dog has imprinted on you\nYou may have a feeling that your dog has put you on a pedestal.

That’s because precocial species, like many birds, cows, and horses, tend to imprint on the first thing they see after hatching or being born. They rely on this person or animal to keep them safe and teach them the ways of the world.\nDogs are a little bit different in that they are altricial, meaning that they are born needing a little time before they’re ready to get up and get going. Rather than imprint on the first thing they see, they tend to learn about their environment from their mother, littermates, and any humans or other animals that are around. As they continue to develop, they can form strong bonds with those closest to them, not just the ones they saw first after birth.\nEach dog is different, and so is the time that it takes them to imprint on a human. Some dogs are quick to trust and devote themselves to their one and only, while others take a little bit of time. The age of the dog as well as any negative past experiences can play large roles.\nDogs who are part of a family can form strong bonds with more than one person. However, they still tend to pick favorites, slightly preferring one person more than others.\nCan your dog be too attached to you?\nIt feels good to be your pup’s numero uno. But is there a potential downside to this attachment thing? There is such a thing as becoming too attached. The main concern about this isseparation anxiety. Some dogs can be so into their chosen humans that they actually become anxious when they’re not with them. Separation anxiety can become a serious issue with dogs becoming destructive to themselves or to your things.\nIf you have concerns about separation anxiety — or other signs that your dog struggles when you’re not around to show them the ropes — check in with your veterinarian or a veterinary behaviorist for advice on managing their behavior.\nAnother potential downside is poor behavior towards other family members. While you may be able to get your dog to go potty on a leash or use their manners at dinnertime, they may not be so helpful when another person asks the same thing of them. This can create negative experiences with other people who aren’t as closely attached to your dog as you are.\nThe three stages of puppy imprinting\nThis stage begins when a puppy first opens their eyes and can last until they are seven months old. The most critical period is from three to 12 weeks of age, when a puppy is learning and observing other dogs, especially their mother and litter mates. They start to understand dog-to-dog social skills such asbite inhibitionandcanine social signaling, with learning about their environment coming in the latter part of this stage.\nThis stage usually happens when puppies are between seven and 12 weeks old and is when puppies start to learn that there is a much bigger world beyond their littermates and mothers. Positive human interactions play a big role in how they will connect with people in the future. This is typically when we think of a puppy imprinting on a human.\nThis is when puppies are most likely to develop intense fears of even seemingly minor factors. Make sure youkeep trainingand the rest of their environment positive, because this is when your pup could become scared or anxious, caused by specific triggers. Fear periods usually happen between eight and 11 weeks, as well as six to 14 months of age.\nAt what age do dogs stop imprinting?\nThe early socialization periods when your puppy is ripe for imprinting typically wrap up by about four months of age. But what if you get your dog later in life, when they’re past this initial rapid learning phase? Not to worry: Dogs can be very forgiving, so strong social bonds and other learning can occur after theinitial socialization period. However, patience is key as it may take a little more time and encouragement for older dogs to imprint on humans.\nCommon dog imprinting behaviors explained\nIf your dog has imprinted on you, you will notice that they will act quite attached to you. You might not be able to go far without them following you (hello, bathroom trip for two?), and they might experience separation anxiety or other anxious behaviors when you are not with them.\nIf you have a little shadow, this likely means your dog trusts and loves you deeply. You make them feel safe and cared for. It might be annoying that they are trailing you just about everywhere you go — but you’re their person, and that has to feel good.\nA study published in2017 by researchers in Austriafound that dogs are sensitive to their parents’ emotional states. They can pick up those feelings over time and begin to mirror their humans’ behavior.\nIf you are the only one who has practiced training with your dog, you will likely be theonlyperson your dog listens to. This is why it’s important for all family members — if you do not live alone — to participate in training, so there is consistency in your dog’s behavior. Otherwise, your dog may learn to only respect your commands and not others’ commands.\nIf your dog is constantly checking in with you, they are probably emotionally attached to you. They feel safe and secure when they are near you and know where you are. Some dogs even like to stay in physical contact with you,leaning on youto show their support and admiration.\nYour dog wants to be near you because you provide comfort and safety to them. It could also be that they are trying tocommunicate something to you. They may be hungry or want to go for a walk.\nYour dog stares soulfully into your eyes because they love you. In fact, staring into each other’s eyes releases oxytocin (aka the love hormone) in both humans and dogs, making both of you feel good.\nThe number one reason is because your laundry and stuff smell like you. It’s comforting and makes them feel safe to be surrounded by your scent. This is another sign that they want to be close to you.\nDogs are pretty amazing creatures — they can use all of their senses to understand how we’re feeling.Research showsthey can recognize humans’ emotions in our facial expressions. Because your dog can sense your emotions, they can probably pick up on cues when you are craving their attention.\nDogs lick their humans for many different reasons. This is a way of grooming you and expressing their love, but it’s also how they might get your attention or soothe themselves if they are feeling stressed. Or maybe you just worked out, and your salty, sweaty skin tastes good to them (probably not the post-workout routine you were looking for). Your dog might also lick you to get you to stop doing something they are not enjoying. It’s always important to pay attention to their otherbody language, too.\nRemember that bit about how dogs feel safer with a certain person in their family? If your pup is snoozing at your feet, orsitting on you, this means they feel secure with you. You mean safety and comfort to them.\nYour dog is excited by your presence, and you make them happy. So, when you come home after being gone (even if you were just running to the grocery store for five minutes), they are overwhelmed by the fact that you’re back with them.\nWant a better relationship with your pup? Here’s how to bond with your dog\nBeing a dog parent means more than just providing your pup with food, water, and shelter. Bonding with your dog comes down to spending quality time with them. This means exercising, playing, and training them.\nTake them for walks where they feel safe and secure, and also have a little fun. Dogs need daily exercise for their physical and mental health. Keep it fun by switching up the route or routine.\nPlay games that stimulate their mind and associate you with good times. Interactive games like tug-of-war or fetch are great options because they require close interaction with you. Of course, playing can also mean a quiet petting session. It doesn’t always have to involve activity.\nMost dogs love to learn things, so teaching them obedience commands and tricks is a great way to help them see that you make a great companion. Always usepositive reinforcementwhen training, and never punish your dog. Punishing them can create fear and anxiety, which you don’t want associated with you.\nBottom line\nImprinting in dogs occurs when a pup forms a strong bond or attachment to a human.\nImprinting in dogs occurs when a pup forms a strong bond or attachment to a human.\nMost puppies will imprint on their chosen humans during their early developmental phases, between seven and 12 weeks of age, but older dogs can still form a strong bond with people.\nMost puppies will imprint on their chosen humans during their early developmental phases, between seven and 12 weeks of age, but older dogs can still form a strong bond with people.\nIf you want to strengthen your bond with your pup, make sure their needs are met and spend quality time with them.\nIf you want to strengthen your bond with your pup, make sure their needs are met and spend quality time with them.\nFAQs\nA puppy might imprint on the person who is providing them with the most care during their early development. That person offers them security and is someone they trust. Older dogs will often choose the person who spends the most time with them.\nDepending on life circumstances and how much time a person spends with a dog, a pup’s bond with them can strengthen. For example, your partner may be your dog’s go-to person because they worked from home and cared for the dog more. But if you now work from home, too, this extra time with your dog can help strengthen the relationship between the two of you.\nAlthough many trainers (and allergists) might not recommend that you let your dog sleep in your bed, experts now suggest that sleeping with your dog can increase the bond with your pup. “I love that we’re reversing the question,” Dr. Dana Varble, chief veterinary officer for the North American Veterinary Community,told CNN in 2021. “In general, it is a very good thing for animals to sleep with their people.” She added: “Dogs and cats who are more closely bonded with their humans get additional health benefits, including increases in beneficial neurotransmitters such as oxytocin and dopamine, the feel-good hormones.”\nThe term “velcro dog” is used to describe a dog who stays close to you and doesn’t want to leave your side. This behavior may also be described as clingy. But the latter has negative connotations — a dog who sticks to you like velcro is really just comforted by your presence.\nReferences\nReferences\nAlbuquerque, Natalia and Briseida Resende. “Dogs functionally respond to and use emotional information from human expressions.”Evolutionary Human Sciences.6 Dec 2022.https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10426098/.\nAlbuquerque, Natalia and Briseida Resende. “Dogs functionally respond to and use emotional information from human expressions.”Evolutionary Human Sciences.6 Dec 2022.https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10426098/.\n“Dogs Imprinting on Humans: What You Need to Know.”Ridgeside K9.https://ridgesidek9nc.com/dog-tips/dogs-imprinting-on-humans/.\n“Dogs Imprinting on Humans: What You Need to Know.”Ridgeside K9.https://ridgesidek9nc.com/dog-tips/dogs-imprinting-on-humans/.\n“Positive Reinforcement Training.”The Humane Society of the United States.https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/positive-reinforcement-training.\n“Positive Reinforcement Training.”The Humane Society of the United States.https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/positive-reinforcement-training.",

  "page_content": "My dog keeps whimpering, and I can’t figure out why. He doesn’t seem to be hurt, and I can’t think of anything that’s changed to make him distressed. So, why does my dog whimper all the time?\nThis is a common ask from pet parents that vets hear, and the quick answer is: This could be happening for a lot of reasons. Let’s break down what could cause whimpering in dogs.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat is whimpering in dogs?\nDog parents want to keep their buddies as happy as possible, so it’s upsetting when a normally quiet, happy pup starts whimpering. Whimpering can take many different forms but usually consists of repeated quiet sounds of discontent. This can take the form of high-pitched whining sounds or lower-pitched moans and groans.\nRegardless of how a dog’s whimpering sounds, its goal is to bring attention to a problem. Pet parents arevery keyed into the sounds of distress in their dogs, and they perceive the sound of a dog whimpering or whining as upsetting as that of a crying baby. While dogs may be great at getting our attention, they’re not always able to tell us exactly what the problem is. Some common causes of whimpering in dogs include:\nAnxiety or fear:Dogs can whimper to show that they’reanxious about something. Anxiety can be caused by many things, including changes in their environment, unexpected sounds or smells, separation from a family member, or problems with a housemate.\nAnxiety or fear:Dogs can whimper to show that they’reanxious about something. Anxiety can be caused by many things, including changes in their environment, unexpected sounds or smells, separation from a family member, or problems with a housemate.\nPain:Painful dogs will whine and whimper to let others know that they’re hurt. How severe an injury must be to trigger whining will vary from dog to dog. Some dogs need to let you know if they’re experiencing even the slightest discomfort. I’ve also seen others that couldn’t have cared less that their broken leg was flopping all over the place.\nPain:Painful dogs will whine and whimper to let others know that they’re hurt.

Dogs frustrated by a toy that slid under the couch or a snack that’s just out of reach may resort to whimpering to let you know that they find a situation unacceptable. Aging dogs may whine for this reason with increasing frequency as they’re not able to comfortably do the things they used to enjoy.\nFrustration:Dogs want stuff (often the things that we have and aren’t sharing) and aren’t too proud to beg.

Dogs want to protect painful areas from further injury, so they’ll withdraw to an area that they feel is safe to nurse their wounds. It’s important to approach a dog in pain slowly and carefully, even if they’re usually friendly.

This helps guide pain management decisions for clinicians to make sure that their patients stay as comfortable as possible. Many signs of pain on the scale can be easily watched for at home if you think your dog is whimpering due to discomfort.\nDecoding the many sounds your pup makes.\nWhy is my dog crying in pain randomly?\nRandom barks, yips, or whines during a dog’s routine activities could be an indication that something is causing them pain. If they’ll allow it, you can check their paws for any wounds or foreign objects. Watch for any evidence of a limp or a trigger for the episodes of pain. If there’s not an obvious, fixable cause, it’s always best to get your dog checked out by your veterinarian. They can do a more thorough exam and check for things like neck pain,back pain, joint problems, and abdominal discomfort that may cause intermittent pain.\nIt’s often hard to know what to do when your dog whimpers when sleeping. Arethey dreaming? Is itbest to wake them? If your dog was feeling fine before bed and has been sleeping comfortably, whimpering during sleep is likely REM activity. It can often be accompanied byslight muscle twitchesor even small barks.\nAlways contact your veterinarian if you feel your dog is in pain. They can diagnose the cause of pain andprescribe appropriate treatmentsto get them feeling better. See your veterinarian if dog experiences any major trauma (being hit by a car, having a scuffle with another animal, taking a bad fall) — even if they seem fine, some symptoms of trauma are not obvious from the outside. You don’t need to rush to your vet every time your dog limps for a few steps or holds their paw up briefly, but any persistent pain (even if mild) should be checked out.\nBottom line\nDogs whimper for many reasons, and it’s not always obvious what they’re trying to convey with these sounds. Anxiety, pain, frustration, and excitement are commoncauses of whimpering. Looking for obvious causes of pain or distress can help to figure out why your dog is whimpering. Have your vet assess any painful areas, persistent discomfort, or abnormal behavior.\nReferences\nParsons, Christine E et al. “Pawsitively sad: pet-owners are more sensitive to negative emotion in animal distress vocalizations.”Royal Society Open Sciencevol. 6,8 181555. 21 Aug. 2019,doi:10.1098/rsos.181555.\nParsons, Christine E et al. “Pawsitively sad: pet-owners are more sensitive to negative emotion in animal distress vocalizations.”Royal Society Open Sciencevol. 6,8 181555. 21 Aug. 2019,doi:10.1098/rsos.181555.\nKogan, Lori R et al. “Dog owners' perceptions and veterinary-related decisions pertaining to changes in their dog's behavior that could indicate pain.”Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Associationvol. 262,10 1370-1378. 19 Jul. 2024,doi:10.2460/javma.24.02.0120.\nKogan, Lori R et al. “Dog owners' perceptions and veterinary-related decisions pertaining to changes in their dog's behavior that could indicate pain.”Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Associationvol. 262,10 1370-1378. 19 Jul. 2024,doi:10.2460/javma.24.02.0120.\nMorton, Carolyn M et al. “Application of a scaling model to establish and validate an interval level pain scale for assessment of acute pain in dogs.”American Journal of Veterinary Researchvol. 66,12 (2005): 2154-66.doi:10.2460/ajvr.2005.66.2154.\nMorton, Carolyn M et al. “Application of a scaling model to establish and validate an interval level pain scale for assessment of acute pain in dogs.”American Journal of Veterinary Researchvol. 66,12 (2005): 2154-66.doi:10.2460/ajvr.2005.66.2154.",

  "page_content": "Do you ever catch your dog squinting at you and wonder why?\nAccording to veterinarianDr. Alisha Kidwell, “A dog’s eyes are like a roadmap to their health and emotions. Paying attention to changes, like squinting, can help you detect early health issues and keep your pup happy.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhat’s your dog trying to say by squinting at you? Read on for possible causes, from emotional cues to medical concerns, and learn how to read your dog’s body language and expressive behavior.\nWhy does squinting occur in dogs?\nDogs have mastered the art of nonverbal communication. They talk with their body language and expressive eyes, from subtle head tilts to tail wags. Squinting could be anything from admiration to asking for help; all it takes is understanding and empathy to figure out a meaning.\nYour dog may not speak your language, but their eyes can tell you a lot if you know how to listen. Squinting can be a sign of contentment, much like when your dog stretches out in their favorite sunny spot or wags their tail with gusto. For example, if a dog squints at you during a snuggle session or while you’re dishing out belly rubs, it’s their way of expressing happiness and affection.\nHowever, squinting isn’t always about the warm fuzzies. Sometimes, it’s a complex form of communication. For instance, a squint paired with lowered ears and a tucked tail may indicate anxiety, unease, or submission. Dogs are masters of reading the room, and their squint could be a subtle way of diffusing tension, such as humans giving a nervous smile during an awkward meeting.\nBefore you start overanalyzing your dog’s emotions, consider their environment. Dogs are curious creatures, sticking their noses (and faces) into everything from dusty corners to grassy fields. It’s no surprise that their eyes may get irritated sometimes.\nSquinting can often be a quick reaction to environmental irritants like pollen, dust, stray blades of grass, or dander. Check for visible irritants if your dog has been exploring the great outdoors and comes back squinting. It could be allergies.\nAs dogs age, their eyes become vulnerable tocanine eye disorders, such as corneal ulcers and glaucoma, which may cause significant discomfort or other health problems.\nCorneal ulcers, for instance, are like paper cuts on the eye — tiny but excruciating. These can happen after eye trauma, such as a playful romp in the backyard that ends with a tree branch to the face. You may notice redness, excessive blinking and squinting, and watery or yellowish discharge.\nA condition known as “dry eye” can also leave your dog’s eyes irritated and itchy, while glaucoma is a sneaky condition that increases pressure in the eyes, causing vision loss.\nIs your dog pawing their face? Do they act sensitive to sunshine or bright indoor lights? Are they persistently squinting? Consult a veterinarian. These are more than quirks — they’re cries for help.\nHow can you prevent and address squinting?\nMost of the time, squinting is a harmless, endearing canine quirk. Occasional squinting is no cause for alarm, whether expressing affection, focusing on you, or signaling relaxation. Like humans, dogs have unique mannerisms, and a gentle squint often falls into the adorable category.\nHowever, remain proactive about your dog’s eye health. Simple practices can help prevent issues before they arise. Combining preventative care with attentiveness will keep your pup happy, healthy, and expressive.\n1. Make eye care a routine.Just as you wouldn’t skip an eye exam, don’t overlook your dog’s. Regular vet checkups can catch conditions like “dry eye” and corneal ulcers early, treating minor problems before they become significant and painful.\n2. Control their environment.Limit irritant exposure by keeping your home clean and checking your dog’s eyes after outdoor time. Rinsing their eyes with a pet-safe saline solution can help wash away dust and debris.\n3. Teach safe play habits.Supervise playtime with new toys and other dogs to prevent eye trauma. Roughhousing is normal for dogs, but it's all fun and games until your pup develops a corneal ulcer.\n4. Consider protective gear.Protective goggles are practical ways to protect dogs prone to eye injuries. Yes, they make them for pups. Think of it as eye insurance for an adventurous canine.\nWhen should you consult a veterinarian?\nCall the professionals if your dog’s squinting seems pain-related or unusual and doesn’t resolve in a day or two. Persistent symptoms like redness, swelling, and discharge are reasons for an immediate vet appointment.\nSometimes, what seems like a minor irritation can indicate more serious conditions. Infections from minor scratches can escalate, while undiagnosed glaucoma can lead to irreversible damage. When in doubt, err on caution with a vet visit.\nFAQs\nAbsolutely. Dogs often squint during happy, relaxed moments as a way of bonding. It’s comparable to a gentle smile, symbolizing trust and adoration.\nOften, yes. A squint accompanied by relaxed body language, like soft ears and a wagging tail, is a sign of contentment.\nDogs are expert listeners, attuned to your moods, tone, and facial expressions. When they squint at you while you talk, they focus on you and try to interpret your mood even if they can’t understand your words.\nReferences\nIOSR Journals. “A Common Problems of Dog Eyes (a Review.”Academia.edu, 24 July 2021,www.academia.edu/50229225/A_Common_Problems_Of_Dog_Eyes_A_Review.\nIOSR Journals. “A Common Problems of Dog Eyes (a Review.”Academia.edu, 24 July 2021,www.academia.edu/50229225/A_Common_Problems_Of_Dog_Eyes_A_Review.",

Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhy do dogs get aggressive?\nDog aggression can stem from a variety of reasons. Some main reasons your dog may be showing aggressive behaviors are: fear; resource guarding or possessiveness; past dog attacks; protection; or pain or illness.\nLack of training:A dog who lacks proper training can be very impulsive, and this can cause your dog to act on instinct and without thinking during situations that are difficult for them, rather than looking to you for assistance. A dog who haspositive-reinforcement trainingis more likely to look to their guardians for help when a tricky situation arises.

Positive reinforcement creates a bond between you and your dog that fosters trust.\nLack of socialization:Dogs who have not been properly socialized may have a higher chance of displaying aggression. When dogs do not spend time around other dogs, they do not learn proper body language and cues, and so they have a hard time understanding dog communication. Unsocialized dogs will not be able to interpret the different signs and signals dogs use to communicate. This may confuse the other dogs interacting with the unsocialized dog, causing disagreements, which can then lead to aggression. An unsocialized dog may also be fearful of other dogs. Fear is a large cause of aggression in dogs.\nLack of socialization:Dogs who have not been properly socialized may have a higher chance of displaying aggression.

Fear is a large cause of aggression in dogs.\nReacting to fear:Fear can be a large piece of dog aggression. Just like humans, dogs can go into fight or flight mode when scared. A dog will typically react with aggression when scared if they have no way out. If there is nowhere for them to go, their instinct is to do whatever they can to get away from what is scaring them. Dogs will typically use body language and show signs that they are uncomfortable before resorting to aggression. Fear aggression is used by dogs as a last resort to get the distance they need from whatever it is that scares them.\nReacting to fear:Fear can be a large piece of dog aggression.

Dogs will typically use body language and show signs that they are uncomfortable before resorting to aggression. Fear aggression is used by dogs as a last resort to get the distance they need from whatever it is that scares them.\nFrom my experience, a friendly dog can become aggressive after they have been attacked by another dog. This can happen when you take your dog to a dog park or just a walk in your neighborhood.Dog parks are notfor you to take your unsocialized dog to socialize. Unfortunately, that is what many people use them for. When an unsocialized dog is taken to a dog park to make friends, disaster can happen.Dog parks can be overstimulatingto even the friendliest, most social dog. When you bring a dog who does not understand social cues to the park, it can cause a lot of miscommunication between dogs. As a result, this can cause fear and aggression to happen.\nIf you have a puppy, it is important to expose your puppy to stable, social adult dogs. By doing this, you will have a great chance of helping your puppy learn how to be a stable and social puppy and adult in the future.\nPuppies are very impressionable, and there are fear periods during puppyhood. Puppies can be overzealous, and not all adult dogs enjoy puppy energy. Stable social adult dogs can teach your puppy the ropes through appropriate behaviors and corrections. When you introduce your puppy to a dog whose temperament you do not know, you risk the chance of letting them interact with a dog who does not have appropriate manners.\nThis could lead to a dog fight, because your young puppy does not have an understanding of dog body language. Puppies are very impressionable. A dog fight may lead your puppy to become fearful of dogs. If your puppy or dog is attacked by another dog, it is a good idea to get them around other well-mannered dogs shortly after the incident.\nWhen your dog growls, they’re expressing their emotions. A study found that you’ll likely be able to understand what they’re feeling.\nTypes of aggression in dogs\nDog aggression can show up in many areas of daily life, but it can be preventable if you know the sights and sounds to look for. Dog aggression does not normally come out of nowhere. Usually, there are telltale warning signs that help you know it is coming.\nUnderstanding dog body language and knowing what to look for is the best way to have a better idea of what your dog is thinking. Some signs that aggression is looming include:ears pinned back; stiff body; harsh stare; growling; teeth baring; lip licking; snapping; or a tucked tail. Typically dogs follow a “dog-aggression ladder.” As they work their way up the ladder, they get closer and closer to possible aggression.\nResource guarding is a normal dog behavior. Dogs may guard the bed, food, toys or people. Resource guarding may look like one dog growling at another dog while they walk by as they are eating. When they do that, your dog is telling the other dog to stay back. Resource guarding becomes a problem when your dog does not listen to cues.\nWhen a dog is pushed to the limit and feels like the resource is going to be taken away from them, they may react with aggression. You can help your dog work through these emotions with specific training. You will first want to start with management techniques to prevent the behavior from happening while you contact your vet and a trainer. These management techniques may include: keeping dogs separate; baby gates; or muzzles. Positive reinforcement, as well as counter-conditioning and desensitization (see below for more information), can help a dog get more comfortable being around resources.\nFear aggression happens when a dog is at their wit’s end and may feel like there is nowhere for them to go to get away from what is scaring them. When this happens, they will resort to aggressive behaviors to get away.\nDogs are descendants of wolves, and even though they have been domesticated for many years, they still possess an innate interest in hunting. Typically, squirrels, rabbits, birds, or rodents will fall prey to this, but small dogs can also be at risk.\nIf you notice your dog stalking, intensely staring, pouncing, or chasing, it is time to intervene. Once they have gotten ahold of the animal, it may die. You can help prevent this from happening by fulfilling your dog’s predatory behaviors in appropriate ways. Usinga flirt poleis a great way to help your dog act out their predatory energy in a safe, constructive way.\nMarking territory is a way for dogs to communicate. When dogsmark something with their urine, they can communicate their gender, age, and health, and show that they have been there or that the space is theirs. You may notice your dog marking more if you bring home a new pet. Keep an eye on this behavior and observe if you notice any other signs that your dog is uncomfortable. These could be the beginning stages of aggression.\nUsing punishment to train your dog can cause your dog to become aggressive. When using punishment, you are training your dog to do a behavior (and if they don’t, the message is that something bad will happen). Depending on your dog’s temperament, they may become aggressive after a punishment has been used on them. When you use punishment, you may cause your dog to become fearful or develop anxiety, which can make them more aggressive. By using positive reinforcement and rewarding your dog for good behavior, you can avoid causing them anxiety or stress.\nWhen a dog is hurt, they may not act like themselves. I have seen this first-hand. My lovable dog Boss, who is a loyal, calm and collected cuddle bug, got injured and seemed to become a different dog. When running down the stairs after a squirrel, his toenail got caught and was ripped halfway off. He returned to the kitchen, and I noticed a large amount of blood. When we figured out what was wrong, we went to try to stop the bleeding and bandage him up before taking him to the vet.\nWhen we went to do this, he turned and snapped at my husband because of the amount of pain he was in and the fear he had that we might try to touch his paw. Luckily,he is muzzle-trained, and so we were able to muzzle him to get him bandaged up and safely to the vet.\nMuzzle-training your dog is a great way to prepare for the unknown and to make sure everyone is safe if there ever is an injury. You can always put a muzzle on a dog, but if you train your dog to wear it before the emergency, this is one less thing that will be stressing them out during an already stressful situation.\nHow to train an aggressive dog\nIt is important to seek the help of a veterinarian when you notice your dog’s aggressive behavior. Your vet may be able to point out a medical reason why your dog is acting aggressively. The vet can prescribe medication to help ease your dog’s anxiety or pain that may be causing the aggression. Your vet may also have recommendations for dog trainers that specialize in aggression.\nFind a trainer who specializes in aggression. Not every dog trainer works with aggressive dogs. It is important to work with a dog trainer who is familiar with aggressive dogs; their practices will keep everyone safe.\nTry to take notes when you notice your dog becoming aggressive. Be observant and think ABCs: antecedent (what happens first), behavior, and consequence (what happened next).\nThis information will help you, your vet, and your trainer gain a better understanding of why your dog is acting aggressively. Once you have a better understanding of the reason behind it, you will be able to figure out the best ways to help your dog.\nExercise and stimulation can help properly provide your dog with outlets to help curb their energy and give them appropriate ways to engage in natural dog behaviors. Allow yourdog to dig in the sandboxor dirt. Usea flirt poleto safely engage their prey drive. Hide toys or treats for them to find around the house sothey can scavenge. Give them bones or frozen chews to practice pulling apart and gnawing.\nAn important part of the dog aggression puzzle is what causes your dog to act out in aggressive behaviors. To help your dog overcome these behaviors, you have to know why they are happening. Keeping a log book of when the behaviors happen, as well as what happened before and after, will help you and your team figure out the best treatment plan for them.\nDesensitization means making your dog less sensitive to the trigger. With the help of a trainer, you can work on exposing your dog slowly in small increments to help your dog become more comfortable with the trigger.\nCounter-conditioning pairs with desensitization to help your dog become more comfortable around their triggers and feeling confident. Counter-conditioning pairs what your dog likes or enjoys with something they are not thrilled with. The slow exposure helps them pair something they love with something they don’t enjoy, which allows them to change their response over time growing more comfortable and confident around something that triggers them.\nFrom my experience, a combination of desensitization, counter-conditioning, and positive reinforcement can help dogs in many ways.\nWhen you have a fearful or aggressive dog, using punishment continues tomake things worse, the dog learns they should be scared of their parents. Dogs do not understand us when we speak; they instead heavily rely on body language. So, when we use punishment to try to teach them something, all we are teaching them is that a normal dog behavior caused their owner to hurt them or yell, and they do not know any better. All they are learning is that their owner is impulsive and scary. Most of the time, the dog will not understand that they are being punished for what they just did. Especially if your timing is off even by a few seconds.\nPositive reinforcement allows you to teach your dog the right thing from the start. This helps build the dog’s confidence and foster a good relationship with them. You’ll create a dog who willingly wants to do things with and for you, such as responding to their name, standing for brushing, listening to the command “leave it,” and more.\nWhile you are working with the assistance of a trainer and your vet, it is important to manage your dog’s aggression. But that can be a slow process. During that time, you want to prevent your dog from engaging in this behavior as much as possible. The more they realize reacting with aggression gets them what they want, the more the behavior becomes engrained and more difficult to work out. Managing aggression is the best way to keep everyone safe.\nUse indoor gates:Using gates to separate dogs who don’t get along, a dog from a new baby, or dogs during feeding time will keep everyone safe. Indoor gates can be used to give everyone the space they need to feel secure. Gates can also be used during training to give you a safety net in case of an accidental training fail.\nUse indoor gates:Using gates to separate dogs who don’t get along, a dog from a new baby, or dogs during feeding time will keep everyone safe.

Allowing dogs off-leash in areas with leash laws is a recipe for disaster. People with possibly aggressive or unfriendly dogs still have a right to go to areas with leash laws. If your friendly dog does not respond to your call and runs up to the leashed dog, that could be a disaster.Unfortunately, this is a great way to also turn friendly dogs into cautious or unfriendly dogs. Over the years, this has happened to my leashed dogs a number of times. Random dogs with no manners run up to my pups, with their owners either nowhere to be found or yelling, “Don’t worry, they are friendly!” I have noticed over the years that my dogs have become less and less tolerant of this. Leashes are a great way to keep your dog safe not only while out and about, but also in your house or in your yard to help give you distance while working on training.\nKeep your dog leashed:Leash lawsshould always be followed.

This will help them get exercise and stimulation safely.\nFind empty outdoor space:Your dog with difficulties still deserves to have a fulfilling life.

Muzzles may look a little scary, but they are a great tool with many uses. Muzzles can keep your dog from eating things they shouldn’t, keeping others safe if they are in pain or injured, and, most of all, keeping your dog from biting.This is a great thing to train when you first get your new puppy. Start by getting them comfortable with the muzzle, rewarding them for looking at it, and touching it with their nose or paw. Once they are willingly doing that, you can begin to introduce them to sticking their nose in the muzzle. Put some peanut butter on the muzzle and allow them lick it off, starting on the opening of the muzzle and working your way further in. Now that they are OK with sticking their nose in, have them stick their nose further inside and reward them with a treat through the holes of the muzzle.Continue to do this, each time waiting a few seconds before rewarding them and increasing the amount of time they wait before getting a treat. Then, you will need to work on your dog putting their nose inside the muzzle and having it buckled over their head. You may need to work on getting them used to the buckle sound on its own, depending on how sensitive your dog is. Once your dog is comfortable wearing the muzzle, do things they enjoy while they are wearing it. Starting with small increments, have them wear it for a few minutes while on a walk, and continue to work your way up to the entire duration.\nMuzzles:Muzzles are a great way to safely allow your dog to have a bit more freedom while making sure everyone is safe.

Other dogs, loud bangs, someone yelling or raising their arms or fists, or coming near them when they are eating are some of the reasons a dog may feel the need to become aggressive.\nAggression is a serious behavior in dogs that can cause harm or, at worse, death. It is best to seek the assistance of a veterinarian and dog trainer. Once your dog’s aggression is under control, you can begin to work on maintaining behaviors at home under the supervision of a trainer.\nSome causes of aggressive behavior in dogs include resource guarding, pain or illness, and fear — to name a few.\nGrowling is your dog’s way of telling you they do not like what is happening, and they want space. Growling is on the ladder of aggression and is a few steps away from biting. If your dog growls, it is best to understand why they are growling and listen to what they have to say. Give them some space and time.",

  },
  "page_content": "Dogs demonstrate many curious behaviors, such as shaking ortwitching during sleep. It can be challenging to decide if the behavior is just normal sleep behavior or if you should be concerned. This article will discuss why your dog may shake in their sleep and when you should see your veterinarian.\nBy understanding more about your dog’s sleep patterns and when there are signs of trouble, you can do your best to keep your pup happy and healthy.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nUnderstanding dog-sleep patterns\nIf you’ve ever read about human-sleep patterns, you’re a step ahead because dogs are similar. They have different stages of sleep, including light sleep, deep sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Each stage is integral to keeping your dog healthy and their mental acuity functioning correctly.\nYour dog appears very relaxed but is still a bit alert during light sleep, a phase during which the body transitions into deep sleep for better rest. Deep sleep, on the other hand, is the stage when the body repairs itself and consolidates memories. Finally, during REM sleep, the brain becomes highly active, which is when dreaming occurs. When dreaming, dogs may vocalize, shake,or twitch, and when they do that, they are processing memories or experiences.\nPuppies andsenior dogsoften show more pronounced movements during sleep because puppies are at a time in their lives when they are experiencing heightened neural development, making their sleep movements more active. On the other hand, senior dogs may have exaggerated movements due to age-related changes in their nervous system.\nIn addition to age, breed and daily activity levels can influence a dog’s sleep. For example, smaller high-energy breeds may be more active during their dream phase, while larger breeds may show less movement and sleep more deeply.\nReasons why your dog could be shaking in their sleep\nMost of the time, shaking is nothing to be concerned about. But because occasionally their movements can indicate a problem, it’s essential to understand the difference between normal sleep movements and signs of an underlying issue. Here are a few reasons why your dog could be shaking in their sleep.\nThe most common reason for a dog to shake during sleepis dreaming. What do they dream about? Just like people,are probably dreaming about their day’s activities. If their legs are moving, they could be dreaming about running. Soft whimpers or barks may accompany this. Puppies may dream more or with more energy because they have so many new things happening in their lives. If your dog’sshaking alignswith their dream-like movements, you can rest assured that this is a normal part of their sleep cycle.\nShaker syndrome, or generalized tremor syndrome (GTS), is a condition in which involuntary tremors occur.  Sometimes, the tremors, which are often rhythmic, occur both during the day when the dog is awake and at night.\nA large dog can get shaker syndrome, but we see it more in small breeds. It’s important to see a vet if this persists. Sometimes, medication is needed.\nSeizures can occur during the day or night. At night, they can sometimes resemble normal REM movements like regular twitching or dreaming. However, seizures are more intense and may include drooling, uncontrollable shaking, or rigid limbs.\nIf you think your dog is having seizures during the night, causes can include epilepsy, head trauma, or other underlying medical conditions. You may notice your dog being more tired during the day or having other behavioral changes. If you think your dog is having seizures, you should see a vet right away. As with most conditions, early diagnosis and treatment will improve outcomes.\nTremors or shaking during sleep can be a symptom of poisoning. It is not unusual for a dog to get into household products, certain human foods such as chocolate, or toxic plants. Symptoms of poisoning may include tremors, vomiting, diarrhea, or lethargy.\nQuick action is crucial if other poisoning symptoms accompany your dog’s shaking. Contact your veterinarian or an animal poison control center for immediate guidance. Provide as much information as possible about the substance your dog may have ingested to ensure they receive the appropriate treatment.\nShaking during sleep can be caused by pain. It can be accompanied by pacing or difficulty finding a comfortable position. The pain can be caused by arthritis, injury, or illness. It may be accompanied by limping, whining, lying still, and not moving.\nIf your dog is having these symptoms, a vet visit is essential. There are pain meds, physical therapy, or treatment for most illnesses.\nWhen should you be concerned about dog shaking patterns in sleep\nWhile occasional twitching or shaking during sleep is generally harmless, there are situations where you should be concerned. Recognizing the warning signs of abnormal sleep behaviors can help you address potential issues early.\nSigns that warrant concern include:\nShaking that is prolonged or unusually intense\nShaking that is prolonged or unusually intense\nOther accompanying symptoms such as vomiting, difficulty breathing, or lethargy\nOther accompanying symptoms such as vomiting, difficulty breathing, or lethargy\nSigns of pain or discomfort\nSigns of pain or discomfort\nA sudden change in your dog’s sleep patterns\nA sudden change in your dog’s sleep patterns\nShaking that occurs consistently and disrupts your dog’s rest\nShaking that occurs consistently and disrupts your dog’s rest\nIt’s always better to err on the side of caution. Consult your veterinarian if you’re unsure whether your dog’s shaking is normal. Provide detailed information about your dog’s behavior, including any other unusual symptoms or recent changes in their routine. Diagnostic tests such as blood work, imaging, or neurological evaluations may be recommended to rule out underlying conditions.\nTips to help your dog sleep better\nEnsuring your dog gets quality sleep can improve their overall health and well-being. Here are some tips to promote better sleep:\nYou probably know from personal experience that it is easier to sleep well if you find your bed comfortable. Your dog is no different. Orthopedic beds can be very helpful for dogs with arthritis. Be sure to provide a bed that fits your dog’s size and needs. Try to keep the sleeping area clean, quiet, and free from drafts.\nYou probably know from personal experience that it is easier to sleep well if you find your bed comfortable.

  "page_content": "For some dogs, scratching, itching, and biting goes from an occasional pastime activity to anear obsession. All waking moments are devoted to trying to calm an un-calmable itch. So, what’s the deal?\nWhat could possibly be causing your pup so much discomfort? As any veterinarian will tell you, the answer isn’t always so simple, but we’ll do our best to help you through this itchy process in order to get your dog the relief they deserve.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nBecause no one deserves to be uncomfy.\nCommon causes of scratching, itching, and biting in dogs\nThe causes of itching and scratching in dogs vary far and wide. Some causes you can see and some you can’t, so don’t be afraid to take a look yourself but then enlist the help of a veterinarian.\nIt should be no surprise that fleas and tickscreate an itchy and scratchy environment. They’re tiny bugs crawling around on your dog’s skin, after all. If the creeping and crawling weren’t enough, both bugs also bite, creating inflammation and irritation. Some dogs even have an allergic reaction to flea saliva, something known asflea-allergy dermatitis, which creates an even more aggressive itch and burn for dogs to deal with. Ticks also  transmit some nastydiseases to your dog, something you’re better off preventing than treating.\nFor most of us, fleas and ticks are a seasonal issue, rearing their ugly heads during the spring through fall. For other unfortunate areas of the country, fleas and ticks can be a year-round nuisance. Using a flea and tick preventative year-round for all of your pets is the best way to keep both critters from taking up residence on your dog and causing constant scratching or more.\nDogs can be plagued with allergies in a similar way to people. Seasonal triggers, such as grass and tree pollens or molds, can cause dogs itchy skin issues, but so can not-so-seasonal things, such as household cleaners and yard chemicals or even your dog’s diet.\nAllergies can behard to pin down, and finding out what your dog is allergic to usually requires some trial and error. Fortunately, there is such a thing asallergy testing in dogs, which can provide some insight into what’s behind their intense itchiness.\nAllergies are best treated by removing the allergen from your dog’s environment, but when that’s easier said than done, antihistamines and anti-inflammatories may help. Sometimes, dogs need something a little stronger, such as corticosteroids or immunotherapy, to find relief.\nThe skin is the body’s protective armor, built to keep bad things out. It does a pretty good job, but it’s not indestructible. While protecting the internal parts of the body, the skin can sometimes become overloaded with bacteria or fungi on the outside, potentially creating an infection on the skin. These things tend to be itchy, stinky, and angry-looking. Some skin infections will be moist and oozy, while others will be dry and flaky. It all depends on what’s causing the problem.\nMost of the time, skin infections will clear up with proper cleaning and medication. Keep in mind that healthy skin is less likely to have an infection. It’s the skin that’s damaged or the immune system that’s run down that allows the problem to get started. So, if your dog has a skin infection, it’s important to look into your dog’s overall health to make sure there isn’t something deeper lurking.\nYou’ve probably noticed an increase in itchiness with the change in the weather. As the winter air dries out, so doesyour skin, potentially causing some minor scratching that wasn’t there during the warmer months. Your dog’s skin is no different, so you may notice more itching and biting as the moisture content of the air drops. This is especially true if they’re hanging out inside your heated home.\nYou can help them out by using a humidifier to increase the air’s moisture and by using a vet-recommended moisturizing shampoo.\nWe’ve already hit on the main two parasites responsible for constant scratching and biting, but wait, there’s more. Though not as commonly seen,mites can be the sourceof some of your dog’s discomfort. Rather than crawl around on the skin’s surface, these tiny bugs burrow into the skin, where, as you can imagine, they create a lot of inflammation, showing itself as itching, scratching, and biting.\nYour vet will be able to diagnose mites by looking at a skin scraping under the microscope. Thankfully, most mite infestations are easily treated with anti-parasiticides.\nIt’s also entirely possible that your dog’s itching is all in their head. Many types of behavioral issues can manifest as constant itching and scratching in dogs. Things like stress, anxiety, boredom, orcompulsive disordersmay beto blame. Often, getting your pup on a routine schedule with plenty of exercise, mental stimulation, and one-on-one affection will help with these, but other times, it takes the care of a vet or professional trainer.\nThankfully, there are treatments. But first, you have to figure out why they have an itch to scratch.\nHow to identify the cause of scratching and biting in dogs\nJust a heads up, you’ll likely need to consult a vet if your dog’s life has been overtaken by scratching, itching and biting, but there are some great ways you can help.\nStart by observing your dog. Are they scratching more during certain times of the day or year? Has it gotten worse over time? Is there any redness, flakiness, or hair loss where they’re scratching? Are other pets in your home (oryou) doing the same thing? Answering as many of these as possible will really help a vet out.\nIf your dog’s scratching is creating sores of its own or just isn’t getting any better, it’s time to enlist the help of a professional.\nTreatment options for scratching and biting in dogs\nIn order to receive treatment, a vet will start with a good, thorough exam. This will likely include taking samples, such as skin scrapings, skin impressions, or biopsies, to look at under the microscope. Some samples may need to be sent off for further examination.\nWith any luck, treating your dog’s scratching and itching will be as simple as giving a flea and tick medication for parasites or bathing them in a moisturizing shampoo. Others may be a bit more involved and include allergy testing, an elimination diet for food allergies, or behavioral modifications.\nHow to prevent scratching and biting conditions in dogs\nThere’s no better way to keep your dog’s scratching and itching to a minimum than with regular veterinary care. Your vet is there to help guide you through things such as proper diets, exercise amounts, and stimulating ways for your dog to spend their day. They can prescribe parasite preventatives and keep an eye on your dog’s skin to make sure everything is balanced and healthy. They will also likely provide a shining light in your allergy journey, should your dog have to take one.\nReferences\n“Allergy Testing and Immunotherapy.”Cornell Richard P.

  "page_content": "Everyone has seen — or lives with — that one dog who’s obsessed with a particular toy. There’sthis dogwho’s eagerly waiting for his stuffed tiger to be washed,this dogwho can’t believe it’s taking so long for her carrot plushie to be fixed, andthis dogwho might actually believe Lamb Chop is his child.\nThankfully, a dog imprinting on a toy can be a “very healthy behavior,” saysDr. Adam Christman, chief veterinary officer for dvm360, who’s based in New Jersey. “It’s a lot of paternal and maternal response to something that they have a deep attachment to,” he says.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nDr. Christman is also avery devoted Dachshund dadwhose home is basically a sanctuary for dog toys. His four pups — Carl, Capone, Connor, and Clark W. Griswold — happen to live there, too.\n“I mean, it looks likeMTV Cribsfor Dachshunds,” he says.\nThe majority of his dogs love Lamb Chop, but Clark W. Griswold (named after Chevy Chase’s character inNational Lampoon’sVacationmovies) has his own favorite special toy that he carries everywhere. The toy is so mangled that it is, apparently, beyond description, and Clark’s attraction to it is a mystery.\n“It almost looks like a person, but we call it ‘his amoeba,’ and he has to take it to bed with him at night,” Dr. Christman says. “It has been washed. We have put it in the dryer, and, you know, Grandma has stitched it back together again. And there have been panic attacks [when we’ve lost it.]”\nDr. Christman likens it to the feeling that a kid might get when they bond with their toy. “It gives them that calm,” he says. “It helps minimize fear, anxiety, and stress.”\nHow do dogs choose “the one”?\nWhile it might be unclear exactly why Clark the Dachshund chose to bond with a “very weird-shaped toy,” as Dr. Christman puts it, it’s obvious that he finds something soothing in his selection.\nA toy might simply be a source of comfort and support because of positive associations, says Diane Kasperowicz, a dog trainer and canine behavior consultant atSuper Houndsin the U.K. “If a toy or blanket was introduced during asensitive developmental stage, that toy may become an emotional anchor for the dog,” because the pup formed a positive association when the toy came into the picture, Kasperowicz says. This can often happen when your dog’s a puppy, and they may find emotional comfort and support from the smell or texture.\nDr. Christman notes that a dog’s favorite “toy” might not even be a toy. “They have their own individual personalities,” he says, and that means for some of them, a traditional toy might not be their go-to. It could also be a blanket, a pillow, a dog bed, or something else. “There’s something that is just their own — like, ‘Listen, everything else is negotiable, but this is not.’”\nDogs have instinctual drives that can also influence which toys they prefer, Kasperowicz adds. For example, dogs with traditionally high prey drives might prefer squeaky, fluffy toys, while dogs whose ancestors were bred for herding might like toys they can chase or corral.\nSize or breed may also factor in. “Smaller breeds, like Chihuahuas, often choose smaller, soft toys to nestle with in their beds when they go to sleep,” Kasperowicz says. Choosing “the one” is all part of their enrichment, Dr. Christman explains: “We want to encourage them to experience and smell different toys and interactions and puzzle toys. But there is that ‘one’ that they have that deep connection to.”\nWhy do certain toys become trends?\nWhile many dogs have a unique pick for “the one,” sometimes it seems like everyone has the same favorite. Dr. Christman was in a Home Goods recently when he saw a woman stockingLamb Chops— the stuffed toys that dogs are absolutely obsessed with. He recounts their interaction: “She goes, ‘Oh my god, I can’t keep these in stock.’ And she’s like, ‘Look at all the other options that they have. Why is it the Lamb Chop?’ I said, ‘Because the dogs have spoken.’”\nHe thinks the attraction is a combination of texture, size, and sound. “The texture is very nurturing to them,” he explains. “It has a maternal feeling … Carlmakes biscuitsoff [of Lamb Chop], like he thinks he’s a cat. And it’s got that honking sound, so it gets the head tilts going.”\nIt’s also possible that a pet parent’s excitement about the toy could help their dog to love it more. Dr. Christman admits that in his house, Lamb Chops keep popping up “like Gremlins.” The little lamb stuffie, originally created as a puppet by children’s entertainer, puppeteer, and ventriloquistShari Lewisfor the TV showCaptain Kangarooin 1956, has spanned several generations with its popularity and notoriety.\n“I think [Lamb Chop] brings back nostalgia from all of us pet owners,” he says. “And although our dogs may not know it, we know it, and it makes us feel good that they love such a nostalgic toy .… I was at our local mall here, and they were doing pet photos with Santa, and I’m like, ‘Oh, look how they’re getting the head tilts!’ Guess [what toy] they were using?”\nIs having a favorite toy healthy for your dog?\nMostly, a dog’s obsession with a favorite toy — whether it’s an ‘amoeba,’ Lamb Chop, or anything in between — is all fine and good. “It’s normal for dogs to have a favorite toy,” Kasperowicz says, “but occasionally, it may be a signal that there is an underlying issue.”\nOne problem could be if they become fixated on the toy and refuse to engage in other activities. “Repetitive or compulsive behaviors related to the toy, such as obsessive licking, chewing, or carrying it around everywhere, could besigns of underlying stress, anxiety, or boredom,” she explains. “The toy may serve as a coping mechanism forseparation-related issues.”\nIn that case, you should have a conversation with your vet about how to handle it. “OCD is a thing, so if your dog cannot do his normal quality of life, the day-to-day activities without it, then it raises a little bit of an alarm,” Dr. Christman says, but he notes that this is rare.\nFor example, if your dog needs to take their toy on every single walk, it’s perfectly fine. “But if they are so obsessed with it [that] it’sinterfering with eatingor going to the bathroom and doing the things that they should do, then it can turn into an unwanted behavior where you might have to do a redirect,” he says.\nDr. Christman notes, though, that more often than not, an attachment to a toy can be a positive thing — and pet parents can use it as a reward in stressful situations. He says “great hack” is to secretly bring your dog’s favorite toy with them to vet appointments.\n“Pick out a toy that they love —aka, ‘a baby,’ you know— and don’t let them know you have it,” Dr. Christman says. “Put it in your purse, put it in a bag, bring it to the front desk. Like, we’ve done things where we go around to hide it so the dog doesn’t know we have it. And then after the exam, we reward them with it, and they give you this look like, ‘How did you know?!’”\nSome dogs arrive at the vet with their favorite toy in their mouth, and Dr. Christman will do the entire exam like that; the toy soothes them and helps them feel at ease, he says.\nToys can also help build your bond.\nAdorably, a toy doesn’t only calm your pup, but it can strengthen your bond too. Sure, your dog might not know that your favorite team is the Mets and that they’re currently holding a Mets plushie in their mouth, but you do—and like putting a baby in a onesie with your favorite band on it, there’s an emotional connection forming there.\n“Like, [our dogs] clearly don’t know the difference,” Dr. Christman says, “but it gives us joy and comfort that they pick something that we also like, and you share this common bond with them. My dogs loveStar Wars, and I lovedStar Warsas a kid growing up, so it brings back that joy.”\nAnd interestingly, the way you introduce or react to a toy could matter, too.\n“Some dogs will also form an attachment with a specific toy or item of clothing or human item because they are rewarded when they show any interest,” Kasperowicz says. “Engagement with their human can be intrinsically reinforcing for the dog.”\nWhat do you do if your dog’s favorite toy gets dirty or torn?\nBut what if your dog’s favorite toy gets damaged—or dirty—and they look absolutely wrecked while you have to make it better?\n“I’m telling you, dogs understand. They get it,” Dr. Christman says. His mom — aka Grandma to the Dachshunds— regularly comes over to sew their toys back up, and they sit patiently to wait until she’s done.\n“This is part of Grandma’s relationship with the kids,” he says. “This is why they’re so bonded to her; she gets her sewing kit, and they see it. They sit like little gentlemen, and they watch her, and then they wait, and she goes, ‘OK, all done.’ And then they take it and they go play. If you talk to them, they will understand that everything’s gonna be OK.”\nIt’s all the more reason to be proactive, too, and make sure you have a backup, just in case a toy is permanently lost or discontinued. (Not that there seems to be any danger of that with Lamb Chop, in particular.)\nHow do you pick the perfect toy for your pup?\nIf you’re trying to pick the perfect toy — in hopes that it might be “the one” — there are some things to consider. Don’t choose just any color, as dogs canmake out some colors more vividly, Kasperowicz says.\n“Toys in blue and yellow are easier for them to see, so choosing a toy with vibrant contrasting colors may be more fun for the dog,” she explains. “Also consider textures when selecting a toy — squeaky toys and crinkly, crackly toys may be preferable for some dogs, and toys with hidden treats or removable items may keep the dog engaged.”\nShe notes that puppies might like softer, plush toys, while adult pups could need something more durable; she recommends interactive toys to engage them mentally, too. Senior dogs may prefer plush, lightweight toys that they can easily carry around. At the end of the day, your dog’s bond with their favorite toy is an important one—and every dog deserves to have a favorite (or lots of favorites).\n“Their lives are too short, and you want to make every day their best day ever,” Dr. Christman says. “And if it’s a toy that’s a few bucks, and it puts a smile on everybody’s faces, I call it a home run.”",

  "page_content": "With just a tilt of the head or flick of an ear, dogs can display many faces that make us smile as well as expressions that we don’t understand. While it may seem like your dog’s different ear positions are there simply for your amusement, these are actually one waythat they communicate. Though not as easy to understand as plain English, ear position is a way most dogs come to understand each other.\nAre you and your dog having a hard time getting on the same communication wavelength? We’ll help you decipherwhat their ear positions mean. Not only will this help you better understand what they are trying to tell you, but it will also help you better respond to their needs.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHow dogs use their ears to communicate\nThere’s no universal language across all animal species, at least not a spoken one. A bark isn’t understood by animals who meow and a neigh isn’t understood by animals who moo, and so forth. In the place of spoken words, animals use body language to let others know they’re feeling friendly, or that they’d better watch their step.\nThe position of a dog’s ears is a big part of thatbody language. Alert ears mean something far different than pinned-back ears. But don’t worry, if your dog’s ears just aren’t speaking to you in terms you understand, other body parts also help communicate how they feel. So, looking at a dog’s ear position — alongside their tail position, stance, and whether their body is tense or relaxed — will also help convey a message.\nHere’s how your dog’s ears can clue you in to how they’re feeling.\nDog-ear position chart\nCommon dog ear positions, and what they mean\nFor most dogs, this will be their go-to ear position. It’s the default when they’re feeling at ease and comfortable in their surroundings. The neutral position of a dog’s ears will largely depend on their breed. As you can imagine, theerect triangles of a Basenjiwill have a very different relaxed position than the drape-like ears of aBasset Hound.\nTo determine if your pup is relaxed and content or not, check the rest of their body for signs of relaxation, including a wagging tail and an open mouth with a lolling tongue.\nWhen a pup perks their ears, it’s likely because they’re tuning into something. Sudden movements or noises can make a dog raise their ears to get a better listen.\nExcitement can also make your dog raise their ears, as they prepare for play or to give you a welcome-home smooch. Along with upright and forward ears, you may also see a wagging tail and an alert body that’s ready for action.\nNow, here’s a dog ear position that can convey a number of emotions, all of which you’ll want to watch out for. Flattened, pinned ears are typically a dog’s way of showingfear, aggression, or anxiety. Their body will likely be tense. Their tail may be tucked or held low, and they may crouch or hunch down. You may also see the hair along their back raise up, and they may even curl their lip (or growl and snarl) if the message just isn’t being received on the other end.Anxious dogsmay also pace and pant, not eat as much, and/or have difficulty sleeping.\nThere’s a lot more to your pup’s furry appendages than you might think.\nHolding their ears backdoesn’t always mean a dog is about to charge. Instead, it could mean the opposite: A dog is feeling submissive and would rather give in to the other’s actions. This is especially true in dogs who are lower on the totem pole orare a little skittish. It’s sort of their way of making themselves look smaller and less threatening. They may also tuck their tail and roll onto their back to further appease their would-be opponent.\nThe shape of a dog’s ears helps them funnel sound waves down their ear canals. The multitude and variation of the muscles in that area help move the ears so the dog can determine the direction and distance of the sound. When you see a dog’s ear rotated outwards, it’s probably because they are trying to hone in on a questionable noise. They may also turn or tilt their head towards the noise. This will likely take your dog’s undivided attention, so expect them to be quiet and still as well.\nSometimes your dog will put their ears through their paces, meaning they go up and down and sideways in a matter of seconds. These quick changes in ear positions usually mean that your dog is confused by their surroundings. Maybe they’re hearing multiple noises and trying to pinpoint them simultaneously. Or maybe they’re feeling a little out of place and uncomfortable in this new situation. They may also be trying to read the body language of their pet parent or another animal.\nAlongside alternating ear positions, they may also switch up the rest of their body language. Their body may be tense or relaxed, They may be wagging or holding their tail stiff. And they might growl or snarl, or pant and lick their lips.\nDo ear positions always mean something?\nAre your dog’s ears in constant messaging mode? No…and yes. No, because that would be a lot of work, and even a dog’s ears need a rest once in a while. But also yes, because your dog is always experiencing emotions, so they’ll even convey a state of contentment.\nNo matter your dog’s ear position, it’s important to pay attention. Not only will it better help you understand their emotions and how to address them, it can also help you recognize a health problem. When one or both ears are held down with a lot of head shaking and ear scratching, it could indicate an ear infection. (Other dogs maywant to lick your dog’s earas well.)\nIf your dog’s ears are trying to tell you something new, it may be time to see a veterinarian.\nFactors that influence ear movements\nLet’s revisit the Basenji versus the Basset Hound ear anatomy for a moment. Obviously, ears that look this different are going to act differently. It will be easy to tell when a Basenji has their ears pinned back, but may be more difficult when they are forward and up, since that’s their normal position.\nAs for a Basset Hound, there’s no way those ears will ever be fully upright or fully pinned back. This would defy the laws of physics. Given how each dog breed has some variation in the shape and size of their ears, you’re allowed a little grace and wiggle room in your interpretations. If a dog’s ear position alone isn’t conveying a crystal-clear message, look at the rest of their body language to sharpen the meaning.\nBottom line\nMany people talk to their dog, and it may be that your dogisanswering back, just with their ears instead of words. Dogs can convey many messages through their ears and other body language — we just need to be able to understand what those messages are. Hopefully, you now have a bit more insight into the world of dog-ear positions, so that you can better communicate with your best friend.\nFAQs\nWhen dogs hear a sound at the door or see a human in the distance, they often perk their ears to determine what’s going on. When they recognize that human or sound, they will often relax their ears as a way to convey comfort. However, if your dog’s ears are pinned down, this could be that they are scared or anxious, especially if you’re doingsomething they hate. This may warrant a consult with a vet or professional trainer.\nFloppy dog ears can be expressive, too. They just may not have the range of motion of smaller, more erect ears. When a floppy-eared dog raises or pins their ears, you’ll see the movement at the base near the head. These movements may be subtle, but they will be there. If you just can’t decipher your dog’s floppy ears, rely on other body language for clarification.\nReferences\n“Anxious behavior: How to help your dog cope with unsettling situations.”Cornell Richard P.

  },
  "page_content": "Just because people and dogs don’t speak the same language doesn’t mean dogs don’thavea language. They do — and it is most often expressed through their bodies.\nWe expect dogs to understand the words we teach them so they will know what we want. Similarly, dogs have the right to expect us to learn their language to understand their needs and desires. One interesting aspect of dog body language is the action of side-eyeing you. Also known as whale eye, this look can represent various emotions and intentions. A dog parent should try to understand this dog expression and learn how to react.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nIf you’ve never encountered or understood canine “side-eye” or “whale eye,” read on to learn all about them. Having a full understanding of these behaviors can help you ensure your dog is healthy and happy.\nWhat is dog side-eye?\nWhen dogs give you the side-eye, they are glancing sideways without turning their heads. When they do that, the sclera (the white part of the eye) appears crescent-shaped, which is why it’s also called a whale eye. Whales do that when they are stressed or alarmed. Likewise, dogs are feeling uneasy, stressed, or overly alert when they give you the side-eye.\nWhale eye is another name for a dog’s side-eye because whales also have more noticeable scleras when stressed or alarmed. This look is subtle but a very powerful part of dogs’ body language. It lets you know their feelings without barking or other more obvious behaviors. Depending on the situation, this look often serves as a warning sign.\nThe side-eye is just one element in a dog’s repertoire of body language signs. Others involving the eye, include:\nRelaxed gaze: indicating contentment or calmness\nRelaxed gaze: indicating contentment or calmness\nDirect stare: which can mean curiosity, attention, or assertiveness\nDirect stare: which can mean curiosity, attention, or assertiveness\nSquinting eyes: suggesting relaxation or submission, depending on the situation\nSquinting eyes: suggesting relaxation or submission, depending on the situation\nHow do you tell the difference between these eye appearances and their possible meanings? You need more information and can get it by observing your dog’s body posture, tail position, and overall demeanor. For example, a relaxed tail can signal playful intent when accompanying a side-eye, while a stiff tail and tense body suggest stress or discomfort.\nManaging expectations about your dog’s behavior makes for a good relationship\nMain reasons for dog side-eye\nA dog can give you the side-eye for various reasons. To understand why, consider other signs such as body posture, environmental context, and accompanying behaviors.\nThe side-eye is a fairly common element in canine body language. Dogs can experience many different feelings just like us, and they use their bodies to “speak” without vocalizing. Some of these feelings include stress, discomfort, or vigilance.\nWhen a dog is stressed by loud noises, unfamiliar people, or other dogs, the side-eye may be part of their nonverbal communication. Other signs, such as lowered body posture, tucked tail, or panting, may accompany it.\nFearful side-eye is often an early cue, giving a warning before progressing to more aggressive behavior. If a dog feels trapped, they may give the side-eye and retreat if they can, instead of attacking. This is an example of how side-eye behavior can help you determine what’s bothering your dog, so you can intervene before the situation escalates.\nUnderstanding fear-based behaviors also helps prevent accidental reinforcement of their anxiety. Instead of comforting your dog in a way that validates their fears, work on creating a calm environment that encourages confidence.\nThere are times when your dog will give you side-eye out of playfulness. This can happen during tug-of-war or when your dog is stealing your sock. In these cases, it is often paired with the body language of a wagging tail or playful posture. This can happen not just with young dogs but with seniors as well.\nDogs are inquisitive creatures. They want to know what you are doing most of the time. They will side-eye you just because they’re curious. Their body language will be different if it’s just curiosity. Ears will be perked, and they will have a relaxed stance. This occurs especially at mealtime or if you’re opening a package. This behavior illustrates their cognitive abilities and an interest in their surroundings. Encouraging their curiosity through games and puzzles will contribute to their mental abilities and overall happiness.\nDogs may communicate pain or discomfort by giving you the side-eye. This may be accompanied by whining, limping, or changes in sleeping habits or eating. In cases of pain or discomfort, side-eye may be a sign they don’t want you to touch a particular area of their body, or they don’t want any physical contact.\nA pet parent should also watch for subtle signs, such as excessive licking of a particular spot or changes in posture. These can be clues that something is bothering their dog.\nNaturally, side-eye could also indicate something is wrong with your dog’s vision, such as your dog’s peripheral vision being stronger. If your pup hesitates to look directly at you, and if other symptoms occur, you should have your veterinarian check their eyes.\nCataracts are common in dogs, who can also experience glaucoma and retinal disorders. They may suddenly start bumping into furniture, not see as well in low-light conditions, or show general disorientation when they walk around the house. Early diagnosis can prevent further complications.\nVision disorders may be more of a problem with certain breeds, such as Collies or Australian Shepherds. Knowing the types of ocular disorders that are more common in your dog can help alert you to the signs and symptoms of possible problems.\nIf your dog has excessive side-eye, you should see your vet because that can indicate a neurological condition. Other symptoms will usually accompany this, such as seizures, head tilting, or uncoordinated movements. If you have a senior in particular, watch for neurological problems, as they are more common in older dogs.\nDespite plenty of reasons to get mad, an animal behaviorist says dogs rarely expressrealanger.\nWhat to do when your dog shows you a side-eye\nWhen your dog gives you side-eye, the appropriate response will depend on the underlying cause. The rest of your dog’s body language will provide additional cues. Here are a few ways to help your pet.\nIf fear or anxiety is the reason for the side-eye, focus on:\nCreating a safe and supportive environment\nCreating a safe and supportive environment\nProviding reassurance through gentle petting, calm tones, and predictable routines\nProviding reassurance through gentle petting, calm tones, and predictable routines\nEngaging in activities your dog enjoys, such as walks or interactive play — positive experiences that strengthen your bond and help ease your dog’s anxiety over time\nEngaging in activities your dog enjoys, such as walks or interactive play — positive experiences that strengthen your bond and help ease your dog’s anxiety over time\nUsing tools like calming sprays or pheromone diffusers to create a stress-free environment, especially during loud events, such as fireworks\nUsing tools like calming sprays or pheromone diffusers to create a stress-free environment, especially during loud events, such as fireworks\nProper training and socialization can decrease bad behavior and make your dog feel more secure.

  },
  "page_content": "We can all agree that sometimes dogs do things that we find peculiar. One such behavior is following us to the bathroom. Do they go to the bathroom with us because we go with them? That sounds reasonable, but according to animal behaviorists, that is not the answer. They do, however, follow us to the bathroom due to everything from bonding to curiosity.\nBy the end of this article, you will have a clearer understanding of why your dog accompanies you to the bathroom. And if that bothers you, you’ll also learn some tips on how to change the behavior.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nTop reasons why your dog may be following you to the bathroom\nYou probably don’t wonder why your dog follows you anywhere else. But why the bathroom? Your dog has adopted this behavior for numerous reasons. Below are the most common ones.\nDogs are very social creatures and like to follow you just about everywhere you go. They see you as their pack leader and want to be close to you, even in your most private moments. They don’t know it’s a private moment. To them, it’s just another area of their home. If they tend to follow you everywhere else, why not the bathroom? They thrive on forming strong bonds with you.\nMany dogs also feel more secure when they’re near their pet parent. Following you into the bathroom adds to the security they feel when they’re near you anywhere. Over time, this bonding behavior becomes even more profound.\nWhen your dog sees you walking away into another room, they may feel anxious. And if they suffer from separation anxiety, following you into the bathroom is just an expression of what they feel when you leave home. The bathroom may seem like a short distance to you. But to your dog, it may feel like it’s an unbearable separation. Following you alleviates that anxiety.\nIn addition, some dogs are afraid of missing out. They want to be part of everything you experience, even if it seems boring to you. To them, what you’re doing is not the fun part — being with you is.\nDogs are pack animals and feel responsible for protecting the pack’s other members. Although the bathroom is not a hidden threat, it is a small, enclosed, vulnerable space. Dogs want to protect you and ensure your safety, so following you to the bathroom is an instinct for safety and protection.\nSome breeds, such as German Shepherds or Rottweilers, are especially geared toward guarding behavior. They feel they must protect you from hidden (or imaginary) dangers by following you to the bathroom.\nDogs really like attention. When you adopted your dog, you may have found it cute when they followed you into the bathroom. You may have pet your pup, cuddled with them, or even given them a treat. Dogs are smart, and it doesn’t take long for them to catch onto the fact that following you to the bathroom comes with rewards.\nDogs are naturally curious and thoroughly enjoy exploring their surroundings regardless of where they are. The bathroom has running water, a toilet flushing, and an array of exciting objects. As puppies, they are even more curious and can be thoroughly entertained while you’re in the bathroom.\nBathrooms have many scents, from pleasant soaps, shampoos, and perfumes to other less pleasant odors. Dogs are known for their keen senses of smell, and following you to the bathroom could offer them a very exciting experience. It could also give them information about their surroundings.\nFollowing you to the bathroom is a habit for your pup. If your dog has been with you a long time and accompanying you to the bathroom has been something they have always done, it’s probably become a habit. Dogs thrive on predictability.\nThey are thecutestlittle shadow.\nHow to manage or modify this behavior\nIf you find your dog’s bathroom behavior cute or affectionate, you may be perfectly happy leaving them alone.

  "page_content": "When you hear your dog barking in their sleep, you probably think it’s cute and endearing. But you’re probably also wondering why this is happening. Is the barking just a normal part of a dog’s sleep, or is it cause for concern? In this article, we dive deep into why your dog may bark in their sleep and offer guidance about what to do (or not do) when it happens.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nUnderstanding dog sleep behavior\nDogs have different stages of sleep, just like people. There’s deep sleep, light sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Vocalizing, twitching, and paddling their legs most commonly occur during a dog’s REM sleep.\nEach sleep stage has its purpose. Dogs stay semi-alert during light sleep and can be easily awakened. This stage is essential for transitioning into deeper-sleep phases. Deep sleep is when physical recovery occurs, allowing muscles and tissues to repair themselves. REM sleep, which includes rapid eye movements and dreaming, is when mental repair occurs.\nUnderstanding these stages, and how they impact your dog’s behaviors during them, will help you determine if there is a need for concern.\nYoucanlive in a quiet house again.\nWhy do dogs bark in their sleep?\nYour dog may bark in their sleep for a few different reasons.\nIt is in dogs’ nature to be vocal. They have an instinct to communicate, and that instinct doesn’t turn off just because they’re asleep. Their vocalizations are probably arising out of a need to warn others about potential threats or to interact with their environment. Ancestral wolves and wild dogs communicated with other pack members by vocalizing, which is still deeply embedded in modern domestic dogs.\nSurprisingly enough, dogs also dream. Dreaming occurs during REM sleep. Humans tend to dream about real-life experiences that happened during the day, and dogs do that, too. Dogs probably dream about chasing squirrels, playing fetch, or meeting other dogs at the park. They are barking while replaying their actions from an earlier time. This is generally harmless.\nIn people, REM sleep is believed to be a way of processing emotions and consolidating memories. This is thought to be the case for dogs as well. So barking during REM sleep is generally harmless and even helpful.\nDecoding the many sounds your pup makes.\nCommon triggers for sleep barking\nSo, what do dogs dream about? We mentioned chasing squirrels or meeting friends in the park. That may be true for happy dogs. But what about dogs who have been traumatized? A rescue dog may dream about bad times in their past, which may make them vocalize. This is an example of how understanding your dog’s past can help you interpret what your pup’s vocalizations mean. For the rescue dog, barking could indicate stress or fear. This discovery could lead you to provide even more of a nurturing environment to help reduce the episodes of fearful barking during sleep.\nIf a dog’s senses remain somewhat alert during sleep, external noises like a car horn or distant siren can trigger a dreaming dog to bark. Therefore, creating a calm and quiet sleeping environment to the best of your ability can help minimize these triggers. Turning on a white noise machine or placing your dog’s bed in a quiet room can decrease the chance of environmental stimuli affecting your pup’s dreams.\nWhat should you do if your dog barks in their sleep?\nDog barking during sleep is usually perfectly normal. It generally occurs during the REM sleep phase and reflects your dog reliving events from their day. However, surprisingly enough, dogs do get sleep disorders that require medical intervention.\nOccasional barking during sleep is perfectly normal for dogs. However, excessive or disruptive behaviors may indicate a sleep disorder. Yes, dogs get them, too. Dogs can have narcolepsy or REM behavior disorder that requires a veterinarian’s help.\nDog narcolepsy is a rare neurological disorder that causes a dog to be excessively sleepy during the day or have periods of muscle weakness. Certain factors, such as excitement, stress, or play, can trigger the episodes. The disorder in dogs is usually genetic. Affected breeds include Doberman Pinschers, Labrador Retrievers, and Dachshunds.\nMeanwhile, dogs with REM behavior disorder act out their dreams during the REM stage of sleep. They may move intensely while sleeping or even seem to be chasing something. If a vet suspects the pup could harm themself, the dog may be prescribed medication.\nThese conditions are rare but watch for unusual movements, frequent interruptions to your dog’s sleep, and prolonged barking or whining. Keep a sleep diary that records your dog’s behavior, noting the frequency and intensity of their sleep barking and other symptoms during the night. If your dog seems distressed or tired despite sleeping, it might be time to see the veterinarian.\nIf your dog has a sleep disorder, there will be other symptoms, such as:\nDifficulty waking\nDifficulty waking\nExcessive daytime lethargy\nExcessive daytime lethargy\nSigns of pain\nSigns of pain\nUnusual movement during sleep\nUnusual movement during sleep\nFrequent interruptions to their sleep\nFrequent interruptions to their sleep\nProlonged barking or whining\nProlonged barking or whining\nIf your dog has any of these symptoms, it’s time to consult a vet. A professional can look for signs of seizures, sleep apnea, or other health problems. They can also recommend tests such as a neurological exam or sleep study. Early detection is always best, so treatment can be started as early as possible for a better outcome.\nBottom line\nIf your dog barks occasionally during sleep, this is usually normal, harmless behavior. Your pup is probably enjoying a healthy dream cycle.\nIf your dog barks occasionally during sleep, this is usually normal, harmless behavior.

  "page_content": "“Finger-lickin’ good” might be KFC’s slogan, but it’s definitelynotthe best use of manners. When your dog licks their paws, though, the issue could be something more serious than bad manners. Although paw licking is a common behavior in pups and sometimes a basic part of grooming, a history of excessive licking could be a big red flag for their health. Plus, constant licking can also cause a secondary infection (bacterial or yeast) because of the extra paw moisture.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nSo, why do dogs lick in the first place?\nDogs are known tolick themselves; it’s no secret. Let’s start with the most basic behavior: self-grooming. You’ve probably noticed your dog licking their paws before a snooze on the sofa, and that’s completely normal. When this behavior intensifies, that’s a problem, and the cause is often environmental.\n“The most common cause of paw licking is generally environmental allergies, also called atopic dermatitis,” Dr. Flynn says. “Other causes of licking paws can include ectopicparasites such as fleasor mites, referred pain fromarthritis— licking the feet or limbs since they can’t reach the painful joint.”\nThe good news here is that many of the causes of a dog’s paw-licking can be resolved at home, and those that can’t often are treatable with the help ofallergy medicationsprescribed by your vet.\nHere’s what works (and what doesn’t).\nCommon causes for paw licking\nWhile cats hold the crown in the self-grooming kingdom, dogs typically aren’t far behind. Even though dogs are known to get muddy and roll in things that smell less than fresh, most of them do like to stay clean. Licking their paws may be their normal way of doing a little self-care and self-cleaning. You may notice they lick their paws when they first come inside or when they’re settling for a nap. Both could be ways of getting things in order, and since many people think thatdog feet smell like Fritos, who can blame them?\nFor environmental allergies, increased ear-scratching and foot-licking are common reactions to things like grass and plant pollens, mold spores, and dust mites. If you find your dog licking excessively and more frequently after trips to the park or a walk around the block, they may have an environmental allergy.\n“Fortunately, [there are] excellent treatment options for this, but an easy first step is to rinse the pollens and other allergens off the feet. This can also help remove bacteria and yeast, which can be involved in secondary infections,” Dr. Flynn notes. Symptoms of environmental allergies in dogs can includeitchy skinand ears, paw licking, rashes, and sometimes running eyes.\nWhen a dog’s immune system overreacts to flea saliva, it’s calledflea allergy dermatitis(FAD). This allergic reaction causes an irritation in the skin, which usually results in an extremely itchy sensation for the poor pup. Dogs will typically scratch and lick their paws and rump in an attempt to soothe the itch caused by flea allergies. Fur loss, thickened skin, redness, andhot spotsare common symptoms indicative of flea allergy dermatitis.\nFood allergiesoccur when your dog’s immune system overreacts to something (a protein or complex carbohydrate) in the ingested food. An important note is that a food allergy differs from a food sensitivity in that allergies will cause an immune reaction versus just digestive irritation.\n“Food allergies are rare in dogs and generally manifest as itching rather than facial swelling as we see in people,” Dr. Flynn adds. The most common foods that cause allergies in dogs include beef, dairy, wheat, egg, and chicken. Your vet can help you check your pup’s food and treats for ingredients that might be irritating them. Symptoms to watch out for include itchy skin, chewing,hot spots,diarrhea, andvomiting.\nDry skin can become irritated, cracked, and flaky (dandruff). Dry skin can be caused by many things, including excessive bathing, which removes a dog’s natural oils, dry humidity, or the allergies mentioned above. It’s important to follow a good grooming schedule to ensure your dog’s coat stays healthy. If your dog has dry skin, you may notice overall itchiness, redness, and dandruff.\nAnother potential cause for a dog’s excessive licking is an injury to the paw itself. In the summer, pet parents should watch out for more than just allergies as a potential culprit.\n“There are also seasonal causes of paw licking such as a blown pad — where the surface is blistered or abraded off — caused by a dog running on hot asphalt or a rough surface like a tennis court,” Dr. Flynn says. “Andin the winter, road salt can be very irritating and cause dogs to lick their paws.” While uncommon, Dr. Flynn notes there are more serious causes for concern when it comes to paw chewing, including deep soft tissue infections, toe fractures, nail bed disease, auto-immune disease and in rare cases even cancer.\nIt’s important to rule out any medical conditions before looking at behavioral issues, Dr. Flynn cautions. Dogs, like people, often seek ways to comfort themselves in times of stress.\n“This behavior can be a form of self-soothing for pain, or in some cases anxiety,” Dr. Flynn says. Is there a change in environment (noises, routine, new pets, or people) that might cause your dog to seek this form of stress relief? In addition to stress, some dogs havecanine compulsive disorder, which is a form of OCD. Common compulsive behaviors for dogs with CCD include paw licking, toy/blanket sucking, tail licking, and tail chasing. Try to identify the causes of your dog’s stressful and anxious behavior and use redirection and exercise to relieve it.\nWhile any breed can beovercome by boredom, it most typically affects working breeds, including but not limited to: German Shepherds, German Shorthaired Pointers, Golden Retrievers, Great Danes, Irish Setters, Labrador Retrievers, and Pointers. When boredom sets in, a dog may simply distract themself by licking when searching for something to do.\nWe mentioned fleas earlier, but they aren’t theonly creepy-crawliesthat can irritate your dog. Ticks, mites, or lice can also cause skin irritation that may lead to your dog licking their paws. Along with that, you may also notice your dog licking or scratching other parts of their body along with hair loss, redness, or sores on their skin.\nA dog’s paw pads are tough and thick, but they aren’t indestructible, and neither is the skin above the paw pads or between a dog’s toes. Tiny things like thistle stickers, thorns, and grass seeds can find their way into your dog’s feet, where they can become quite an irritation. Dogs may lick at their paws as a way to soothe or help remove the source of the irritation. You may notice red spots, swelling, or even wounds if there is a foreign object.\nDogs have nearly 20 bones in their front feet and around 15 in their hind feet. Couple that with even more teeny tiny bones in their wrists and ankles, and you’re left with a number of joints that could potentially become arthritic.Arthritis creates a lot of inflammation andpain which a dog may try to soothe by licking. Arthritis may also cause stiffness, not wanting to walk, and swelling of the feet.\nThe skin is an organ specially designed to protect the inner workings of the body, among other things, and it does a pretty good job at it. But there are times when the skin can become damaged or overwhelmed with bacteria or fungus, and your pup can get an infection. Skin infections thrive in dark and moist environments, such as between the toes or foot pads and can really bloom into an ugly flower of redness, irritation, and oozing or flakiness.\nAutoimmune diseases are when a dog’s immune system goes haywire and starts to attack the body rather than protect it. There are many types ofautoimmune diseasesin dogs, which are fortunately not common, and some of them can show up as skin lesions as well as paw licking in dogs. Any unexplained skin issues should be checked by a vet.\nSigns it’s time to take your dog to the vet for obsessive paw-licking\nEvery dog is going to lick their paws from time to time and these little moments are typically nothing to worry about. But if your dog’s paw-licking has become more of an obsession than a quick clean up lick, it’s likely time to see your veterinarian.\nThis is especially true if your dog’s paw-licking has created an ugly mess out of their feet. Any redness, swelling, hair loss, or bumps should be checked out sooner rather than later.\nYour veterinarian is going to need some help from you with this one. They’ll want to know when it started, what triggers it, and any other signs your dog may be showing. They will take it from there with an exam that may include taking some samples to be more closely looked at. X-rays and bloodwork may also be necessary.\nTreatments may include medications for allergies, infections, and parasites, removal of foreign objects, and lifestyle changes for allergies, arthritis, and behavioral issues. Basically, thetreatment includes removing the cause of the irritation, then getting the skin to heal.\nHow to prevent paw-licking\nHot spots, lick dermatitis, bacterial infections, and yeast infections are secondary causes of concern with excessive paw-licking. Check your dog’s paw pads, in between their toes, and along their legs for anything which might be causing irritation. If you think your dog is licking or chewing too much, it’s essential you prevent further licking and reach out to your veterinarian for an evaluation.\n“A dog will make a mountain out of a molehill and can do a lot of damage in a short amount of time,” Dr. Flynn cautions. “Rinsing the foot with lukewarm water then drying it thoroughly may help make the area more comfortable in the meantime.” While you are waiting to be seen by your vet, consider getting an e-collar (cone) or basket muzzle to prevent injury.\nYou know your dog better than anyone else. To help identify an abnormal situation, you must first knowwhat is normal. Changes in health are often subtle or happen over a long time, making noticing a problem more difficult. So, pay attention to your dog’s normal behavior.\nFrom home treatments to holistic methods—and when to call a vet.\nFinal thoughts: Why do dogs lick their paws?\nPaw licking in dogs can stem from a variety of causes, a few of which are normal and some of which can indicate something serious.\nPaw licking in dogs can stem from a variety of causes, a few of which are normal and some of which can indicate something serious.\nIf your pup is licking their paws, start by giving everything a look over, checking the skin, paw pads, between the toes and by feeling the joints.

This helps prevent overgrown nails and breakages that can be painful. You’ll also want to check your dog’s feet, especially after being outside in extreme temperatures. Lightly washing their paws with warm water can help remove irritants, debris and other things that could create problems. Trim the hair between a dog’s toes, if long, to prevent snowballs and debris from packing in there as well.\nBefore treating your dog’s paw licking, you’ll want to find out what’s causing it. This may take a trip to the vet. Otherwise, you can start by washing their feet with lukewarm water and thoroughly drying them. Don’t apply any ointments or medications unless instructed by your vet.\nBecause the legs are an extension of the feet, any of the above causes could apply to licking the front legs. If this is something new your dog is trying, consider seeing a vet to pin down the cause.\nLicking themselves is a normal behavior for dogs, but it’s not one you’ll want to see them take to the extreme.

  "page_content": "We’ve all been there: You’ve been awake only 20 minutes, you’ve stubbed your toe, you’ve spilled your coffee, and you couldn’t smile if someone gave you a million dollars. You “woke up on the wrong side of the bed,” as the saying goes—and you’re about as grumpy as you’ve ever been.\nIn those moments, you’re pretty sure you’d be better off if you gave up and went back to sleep. But do our dogs experience the same thing? It seems so.Dogs can absolutely wake up on the wrong side of the bed, saysKelly Moffat, a veterinarian and veterinary behaviorist who’s the medical director at VCA Mesa Animal Hospital in Arizona.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n“Just like humans, dogs also feel a range of emotions,” she explains. “While this may not present in the same way that it does for people, it can be possible for dogs to wake up feeling cranky, such as if they haven't gotten enough sleep.”\nYou may wake up and be in a bad mood and be able to express that verbally, but since dogs can’t, it’s important to read the cues.\n“Being in a bad mood is such a human term,” saysTatiana Yastremski, a certified dog trainer and canine behavior consultant atSt. Hubert’s Animal Welfare Centerin Madison, New Jersey. “When it comes to animals, and in this case dogs, I prefer to refer to it as changes in a dog’s emotional state.”\nA dog’s brain functions similarly to a human’s brain when it comes to emotions, she notes, despite the fact that their emotional range is more limited. “The hormones that govern the dog’s emotions are the same as human hormones, and therefore, dogs’ brains can go through the same or similar chemical shifts when their emotional state changes,” Yastremski explains.\nIn other words, theycan wake up grumpyjust like us.\nHow do I know my dog’s in a bad mood?\n“While dogs can certainly show signs of distress, it may not present in the same way that it does for humans,” Moffat says. “It’s important to know your dog’s specific personality traits that may point to whether your dog is feeling down.”\nA pup who’s woken up feeling stressed, agitated, or just simply out-of-sorts could exhibit symptoms like pacing, whining, barking, yawning, pinning their ears back, panting, digging, tucking their tail, or simply hiding, according to Moffat.\nEvery dog’s an individual, so the way each one expresses a “bad mood” will be different, Yastremski says.\nYou should be especially concerned if you think the bad mood could be caused by pain. “If pet parents are observing something that is not characteristic of their dog, they should take note,” Yastremski explains. “For example, if one’s dog usually loves being pet or massaged, and suddenly either avoids the activity, or begins showing aggressive behaviors to prevent being pet ... the dog could be experiencing physical pain.”\nWhat triggers a dog’s bad mood?\nA bad dream, pain, a poor night’s sleep, or a multitude of things can cause a dog to wake up in a “bad mood,” in the same way that a human’s grumpy attitude can have many causes.\n“A stressful experience from the previous day, such as a visit to a veterinarian, may have an impact on the dog’s mental state,” Yastremski says.\nPhysical pain, as well as seasonal or sudden weather changes, can also affect your dog’s emotional state. “Some dogs are very sensitive to the changes in barometric pressure and cansense an approaching storm,” Yastremski notes. “While this may not necessarily result in a ‘bad mood,’ one can see their dog’s anxiety level increase.”A bad night’s sleep or changes to a dog’s routine could also result in a grumpy pup, Moffat adds.\nAnd Yastremski notes that good experiences can also produce emotional changes. Her lucky pup had a very busy week recently: day camps on alternating days of the week and ascent-tracking class, which turned out to be very stimulating but also tiring. Later that day, when Yastremski tried to massage her paws (something her dog has enjoyed for two years), she showed her teeth and growled at her.\n“By doing that, she communicated to me that she didn’t want me to touch her paws. I respected her wishes and realized that she was most likely really tired from her multiple escapades that particular week,” Yastremski says. “I now know that when my dog is tired, she wants me to leave her be.”\nHow can I help my dog if they wake up in a bad mood?\nMoffat says that one of the most important things you can do is stick to your routine that day to “help your dog get back on track.”  If you must veer from your routine — for example, if you have guests over — give your dog a safe haven where they can take some time for themselves, she says.\nTent beds or extra cozy crates can be good for letting a dog decompress as long as they can come and go as they please.\n“Pet parents should listen to their dogs and respect their wishes,” Yastremski says. “If one’s dog growls in response to being touched or pet, stop petting and give them the space they need. Allow the dog to decompress. For some dogs, this could mean going for anice sniff-y walkwhere they get to explore new scents, for other dogs this may mean gnawing on a bone or a long-lasting chew, and yet others it could be a fun game of fetch or tug with their human.”\nWhen should you see a vet?\n“If the issue remains consistent or your dog is acting out in a way that could be dangerous — such asdigging under the fenceand escaping — it might be a good time to check in with your veterinarian,” Moffat says. “They can help you ensure your dog's behavior isn't caused by a medical issue; for example, some dogs will act differently if they are in pain.”\nKeep a record of your dog’s out-of-character behavior by jotting it down in your Notes app or filming it, and be ready to share it with your vet, Yastremski says.\n“Once a medical issue is ruled out, consulting with a certified professional trainer, a behavior consultant, or a veterinary behaviorist should be your next step,” she adds. With all hands on deck, you’ll be able to get to the root of the problem. That way youandyour pup can get a good night’s sleep and wake up refreshed and ready to take on the world together — or just spend the day happily snuggling on the sofa.",

Some dogs go between your legs to show affection towards you,” she says. “And some dogs go between your legs because they are scared and need your reassurance.  The best way to know why your dog is going between your legs is to consider the context, and pay attention to their body language.”\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a shy pup to go from wallflower to social butterfly.\nThe most common reasons dogs go between legs\nThe reasons why dogs go between legs can range from looking for attention to seeking warmth. Here are the most common explanations for this behavior.\nDogs like to be close to those who comfort them. So if your dog goes in between your legs, it might just be because they are looking for comfort from their favorite person.\nYour dog might be showing you that they are submissive by going in between your legs. However, the submissive behavior might also stem from your pup being scared or anxious (see “Experiencing anxiety or fear,” below).\nYour dog could just be looking for attention or affection from you when it goes between your legs. “If you just came home from work and your dog is running towards you tail wagging, ears perked, and they go between your legs — this clearly means they are happy to see you and showing you some love,” Limazati says.\nThis behavior may also be associated with anxiety or fear, which is another reason to read your dog’s body language. Other indicators include a lowered tail, whining, pacing, or excessive barking. Limazati explains, “If you are outside and a garbage truck is making loud noises, and your dog goes between your legs with their tail tucked and head down, this most likely means they are scared.”\nIf you are outside with your dog in cold weather, this could also be a sign that your dog is cold and coming to you for warmth. If they are shivering or in a hunched posture, those are other indicators that they may be cold.\nPro tips for boosting the confidence of a scaredy-cat dog.\nShould you allow your dog to go between your legs?\nIf this behavior isn’t bothersome, you don’t need to do anything. In fact, this can even help tighten your relationship with your dog. “As a trainer, I teach dogs the middle cue to go through their pet parent’s legs on cue for many reasons and uses,” Limazati says. “Going through legs can build a bond between a pet parent and dog, can build confidence, and can also keep a dog safe, for example, in a crowded space like an elevator.”\nHowever, depending on the way your dog uses this behavior, you may want to consider training to curb it.\nHow to address and modify your dog’s behavior\n“If your dog is constantly going in between your legs because they are afraid of people, places, or things, this is a sign that it’s time to bring in a professional, certified behavioral trainer to help your dog gain confidence and independence,” Limazati says. “Sometimes, a dog can be protective of their pet parent and guard them from in between their legs. This, too, is a reason to bring in professional help. You never want to let anyone pet your dog while they are between your legs, as your dog may feel protective or threatened in that position.”\nPay attention to your dog when they are in between your legs, and consider why they might be participating in that behavior — and if it’s something worth modifying. Here are some ways you may begin to change that behavior.\nUsing positive reinforcement techniques involves petting your dog, praising them, and giving them treats when your pup is in a preferred position that isn’t between your legs.\nIgnoring your dog when they try this behavior is a good way to begin to correct it. You can also begin making the space between your legs inaccessible so they can’t get in there, learning that it isn’t an acceptable place for them to stand or sit.\nHow to improve your dog’s confidence\nPositive reinforcement for good behaviors is a great way to boost your dog’s confidence. Consistent training and lots of physical activity can help, as does creating a safe space for your pup and providing lots of patience as a pet parent. One of the most important things you can do is take the time to observe your dog’s body language, so you can understand how to better help them.\nWhen to seek professional help\nIf your dog standing or sitting between your legs is coupled with anxiety, fear, or aggression, it might be time to seek a professional trainer. Also, if it’s becoming a daily annoyance or causing a safety risk, be sure to contact your veterinarian.",

Dogslovetolickseemingly everything, including their human’sears. If your dog loves to lick yourears, you might have found yourself wondering whether its normal. While we tend to love everything our pets do, there are some things that go a little too far for our patience, and for some, that includesear-licking.\nRead on if you want to find out why your dog licks your ears and what you can do to stop them (if you want!).\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nMain takeaways\nEar-licking is totally normal for dogs.\nEar-licking is totally normal for dogs.\nIf you want your dog to stop licking your ears, you shouldn’t encourage the behavior.\nIf you want your dog to stop licking your ears, you shouldn’t encourage the behavior.\nYour dog might be grooming you or showing that they’re submissive.\nYour dog might be grooming you or showing that they’re submissive.\nIs ear licking normal for dogs?\nIf your dog likes to lick your ears, you might be wondering,is this behavior normal? Turns out you have nothing to worry about. VeterinarianDr. Guy Sandelowskysays it can be normal and instinctive for dogs to lick our faces, including our ears, “especially if such behaviors are encouraged or positively reinforced.” You know, like if you laugh and play with your dog as they do it?\n7 common reasons why your dog licks your ears\nThere are a few reasons why your dog might lick your ears.\nLicking can be a sign of affection and social bonding. “Adult dogs will often lick their puppies or playmates as a natural sign of affection, so we can assume a similar thought process occurs when they lick our ears,” says Dr. Sandelowsky.\nDogs might take it upon themselves to groom you as a family member. “Dogs will lick themselves as part of normal grooming, and mutual grooming between mates is another common affection-related behavior, which could explain why dogs might want to lick our ears as well,” Dr. Sandelowsky says.\nOne reason why a dog might lick your ears is that they want attention, and when they lick you, you give it to them. If you want your dog to stop licking your ears, you should probably stop giving them that attention.\n“Dogs tend to use their mouth to explore and communicate with the world, including picking up a new odor or taste they have detected around our face or ears,” Dr. Sandelowsky adds. If they keep licking after they’ve discovered that smell or taste, you might just smell delicious to them.\nDogs can get stressed and anxious, and licking you, especially around your ears, might soothe them. If you notice other symptoms of stress, you may need to go to the vet or see if there’s anything that needs to change in their environment.\nOne pretty simple reason why your dog might be licking your ears? They could just be bored. If they seem to do it compulsively when there’s nothing else happening, they might just be looking for something to do and trying to get your attention.\nYour dog sees you as a source of comfort and security, and licking behaviors tend to soothe dogs. Licking your ears might just be another way that your dog is seeking comfort.\nIs ear licking a submissive behavior?\nDogs are often submissive to their parents, and ear licking could be another way to signify this submission. “Dogs may lick our ears as a form of communication to express excitement or submission. Other common submissive behaviors include lying on their back or side. In the end, all dogs express themselves in different ways,”  Dr. Sandelowsky says.\nShould you stop your dog from licking your ear?\nWhether or not you really mind it, you might be wondering whether it’s healthy for your dog to lick your ears.\n“Good hygiene is important around pets because dogs will have potentially harmful bacteria and other microbes in their saliva and mouth,” Dr. Sandelowsky says. “It is, therefore, generally not recommended to allow them to lick your face area, including your ears. Where this is not avoidable, it is best practice to wash the area with antiseptic soap to avoid cross-contamination.”\nIf you want to stop your dog from licking your ears, Dr. Sandelowsky says that it is important not to encourage these behaviours with positive reinforcement. “This means avoiding playful noises, stroking your dog back or giving them a treat (or toy) when they lick your ears,” he says. “Instead, it’s best to ignore such gestures, and to move away from your dog if they start ear licking.  Rewarding other more favourable behaviors, such as being well-behaved on a walk or when visitors are at the house, shows your dog you are happy with other things they can do to please you.”\nFinal thoughts: Why does your dog lick your ears\nThere are many reasons why your dog might lick your ears, and none of them are really anything to worry about. However, if it is bothering you, you can stop them from licking your ears.\nFAQs\nIf your dog seems to lick your ears compulsively and won’t stop when you try to distract them, they might be obsessed with licking. Keep trying to distract them and positively reinforce when they don’t do it.\nWhile Dr. Sandelowsky says it’s best to keep your ears and face clean and free of dog spit, there aren’t any serious diseases you could catch from your dog licking your ears.\nYour dog might smell your ears for any number of reasons; maybe they like the way you smell, are seeking comfort, or are grooming you.\nIf your dog, particularly if they’re a puppy, nibbles your ears, they’re likely just playing with you.\nReferences\nAlbuquerque, Natalia, et al. “Mouth-Licking by Dogs as a Response to Emotional Stimuli.”Behavioural Processes, vol. 146, Jan. 2018, pp. 42–45,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2017.11.006.\nAlbuquerque, Natalia, et al. “Mouth-Licking by Dogs as a Response to Emotional Stimuli.”Behavioural Processes, vol. 146, Jan. 2018, pp. 42–45,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2017.11.006.\nLevy, D.

  "page_content": "You finally did it. After months of scrolling through rescue Instagrams and humane society websites, you’ve adopted the perfect shelter dog. But, uh… now, what?\nWhenbringing home a rescue, it’s crucial to meet them where they’re at and to know that their demeanor might change over time. To learn what behaviors to expect from shelter dogs, we spoke with two experts who offered their best tips to set new pet parents up for success.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nDo shelter dogs have behavior problems?\nIn some circles, shelter dogs have gotten a bad rap for being unruly or even aggressive. While this may be the case for some dogs, rescue or otherwise, it’s often the result of a slow escalation. With the right behavior modification training, we can interrupt these behaviors before they become solidified habits.\nDogs rarely become aggressive, lunge, or bite out of nowhere.  Instead, they usually show theirstress through body languagebefore acting out. No matter where your dog came from, understanding how they communicate will help you better understand their needs and prevent aggressive behavior toward yourself, strangers, and other dogs.\n“As a guardian, knowing how to read your dog’s body language, understanding what aggression escalation looks like, and the various states of canine maturity and what they entail, is so important,” says certified dog behavior consultant andShelter Behavior Integrationsowner Laurie Lawless .\nCertified dog behavior consultant and accredited dog trainerEmily Scottagrees that body language is a crucial “barometer” for gauging your dog’s comfort zone.\nSigns your dog is stressed or scared can include:\nLow, stiff posture\nLow, stiff posture\nShaking or jumpiness\nShaking or jumpiness\nGrowling or snarling\nGrowling or snarling\nExcessivelip-licking\nExcessivelip-licking\nRaised hackles\nRaised hackles\nEars pinned downor pointed forward\nEars pinned downor pointed forward\nTailbetween legs\nTailbetween legs\nWide “whale eyes” or rapid eye movement\nWide “whale eyes” or rapid eye movement\nIf your dog seems anxious, stop whatever you’re doing, and let them retreat to a place that feels safe. Don’t force them to continue the activity that makes them uncomfortable without consulting a professional; that’ll only make things worse.\nEvery dog is different, so their reactions to a new home will naturally vary as well. That said, there are some shared themes.\nScott says it’s common for shelter dogs to be warm and loving toward onlysomemembers of the family. Based on their prior history, they might be skittish around small children, men, or another group. If you notice this, avoid having that family shower your dog with unwanted attention, hugs, and interactions. Instead, let the dog adjust to their presence slowly andinteract when they feel confident.\nYour new dog might also run into some potty issues. “They don’t know where they’re supposed to go in this new setting, so they have accidents,” Scott says.\nThis is especially common during the first day or two, even forpotty trained dogs, Lawless says. “Transition can be challenging, so even simple behaviors can be totally upended.” If your new dog is having accidents, be patient, and remember that these problems are temporary.\nBoundaries, right? But if they end up sleeping in bed, that’s cool, too.\nIt can take months for a dog to begin feeling comfortable, Scott says, and up to a year before they feel truly acclimated to their new routines. However your dog acts when they first come home, there’s a good chance their full personality won’t emerge until after they’ve settled.\n“Some dogs act out right away and then settle in with routine and consistency, and other dogs will suppress behaviors under initial stress and then show more behaviors once they are comfortable,” Lawless says.\nEven dogs that are quiet upon arrival might grow territorial over time, once they realize that your home is also their home. “When they first come into the home, they don’t know it's their property,” Scott says. “...But as they get accustomed to being in this environment and realize,This is my territory, it’s very common tosee the barking come out.”\nIf your dog becomes territorial, try giving them treats when the doorbell rings tocurb their fear and build a positive association. You might also put them in another room to deduce the stress of involving them in the greeting process. If that doesn’t work, consider hiring a trained professional to help.\nIf you notice your dog reacting to a particular situation in a new way more than once — especially if they display fear, anxiety, or aggression — Lawless suggests journaling to track both the behavior and any attempts you make to mitigate it. “If it gets to a point in which you need to reach out for help,” she says, “ trainers will first want to look at behavioral patterns and initial interventions so their training plan can be most effective and efficient from the get go.”\nFour tips for bringing home a shelter dog\nWhen adopting a rescue dog, take these steps for a smoother transition.\nWhenever bringing home a new pet, it’s tempting to start having fun right away. But flooding your dog with new experiences could overwhelm them and make the adjustment period that much harder. “All dogs need time to decompress,” Scott says.\nWhen they first arrive, “most dogs are still kind of traumatized from being in the shelter and foster care, and/or on the streets,” Scott says. “They're still just trying to navigate living in the human world, let alone going to games and concerts and restaurants and dog parks.” That’s why it’s best to “go a lot slower than you think.”\nEarly on, let your new dog negotiate their new environment gradually. Don’t force them to interact with you if they’re not ready, and don’t invite the whole family over to greet them. Once youareable to receive guests, invite one or two at a time. Dissuade visitors from forcing social interactions and let the dog come to them instead.\nIf your dog is scared of the leash, don’t drag them outside anyway; speak with a trainer who can help them overcome that fear. Whatever happens, be compassionate and remember how much new information your dog is processing at once — right down to learning their own name. This is a learning process for both of you.\nBefore you bring your shelter dog home, identify some places where they can safely sleep, sit, and eat.\nPlanning is important, and so is paying attention to how your dog responds to their new set-up. “You may set up a crate, a bed, and a feeding area where you envision the dog would use those items,” Lawless says, “but allowing the dog to choose their preferences as much as possible is very important in allowing them to settle in.”\nIf you’ve set up anew crateon one side of the bed, but your dog actually seems to prefer the other side, consider shifting items around. If you set up your dog’s eating station in the kitchen only to find out that the area intimidates them, try moving the bowl somewhere quieter. The goal is to be both considerateandreceptive to new information as your pet gives it to you.\nLawless and Scott agree that following predictable routines is key. Feed and walk your dog at the same time each day to help them get the lay of the land and build confidence.\nWhatever your dog’sexercise needs might be, find ways to build that activity into your day as well. As Lawless notes, “Dogs who don’t have their physiological needs met will figure out how to do so on their own, and it's definitely not going to be in the way most households will find constructive.”\nIt can also help to limit your dog’s access to certain items and areas in your home while they explore — particularly those that could inspire unwanted behaviors. For example, Lawless notes that many dogs will try to get into garbage cans or steal snacks stored on the kitchen counter. Consider securing those items and using boundaries, like baby gates, to keep your dog at bay. That way, they can learn the house rulesafterthey’ve started feeling safe.\nIf you already have another dog in your home (or a cat, or a bird, or anything else), foster healthy relationships between them by establishing boundaries.\n“If you have a multi-dog household, it’s important to prepare your current dog for both dogs to have their routines changed,” Lawless says. “If you need to make adjustments to furniture or the household, doing that a few days to a week ahead of time can be helpful.”\nSet up a barrier for the first introduction, like a baby gate, to help your dogs get acquainted from a safe distance. Once they seem used to each other and express friendly interest, remove the barrier and let them greet one another up close.\nEven after your dogs start sharing space, keep their eating areas separate to dissuade competition andfood aggression. Similarly, put away any toys or treats that could inspire rivalry; let the dogs get used to one another before slowly reintroducing the toys.\nFor starters:No, they’re not all traumatized andyes, youcanfind a purebred puppy at a shelter.\nHow do I make a behavior modification plan for my shelter dog?\nIf your dog is exhibiting new, unwanted behaviors, a trained specialist can help you overcome them with gentle techniquesbased in positive reinforcement.\nAs defined by theAmerican Animal Hospital Association, behavior modification uses techniques, like rewarding good behavior, to encourage repetition and desensitizing dogs to their triggers through gradual, carefully calculated exposure. Typically, this approach avoids using fear- and punishment-based techniques.\n“Training should start right away,” Scott says. The sooner you start, the smoother the results will be, because habits have had less time to solidify. Lawless agrees: “Don’t wait until something bad happens to get in touch with an expert.”\nReferences\n“Changing Behaviors.”AAHA, 5 Aug. 2024,www.aaha.org/resources/2015-aaha-canine-and-feline-behavior-management-guidelines/changing-behaviors/.",

Dodogs watch TV, or are they drawn to the movement?\nDogs are curious, and TV can be surprisingly engaging — whether it’s the sound of an on-screen doorbell or the sight of another animal. But not all dogs are glued to the screen.

Dogs can process images faster than humans, meaning the frames on your screen appear smoother to them than to us. While our human brains register screen movements at 60 frames per second, dogs have a refresh rate of 75 frames per second. This explains why older TVs don’t grab their attention like modern HD screens.\nDogs’ viewing experiences are shaped by their vision. Dogs have dichromatic vision, meaning they see best in shades of yellow and blue. Pups would likely perk up more for a vibrant nature documentary than a made-for-TV drama or soap opera with muted tones. Audio cues also significantly affect how a dog interacts with TV. The squeak of a toy or another barking dog can draw your dog’s attention. Dogs can and do watch TV, but their experience is distinctly canine.\nDon’t hit pause on your pet’s playtime – these solo activities will help 9-5 fly by for them.\nWhat do dogs like to watch on TV?\nDogs are drawn to TV programsthat feature other animals, especially if those animals bark, move, or make interesting noises. Shows such as nature documentaries or pet streaming channels tend to grab their attention. Some dogs love watching sports because the fast movement of the ball and people mimics their favorite game of fetch.\nIf your dog spends most of their time with you, they may pick up on your emotions and energy while watching certain shows. Your laughter, gasps, breathing, or even shouting at the screen could make them curious enough to tune in.\nDo dogs think TV is real?\nDogs have unique senses, so while they may respond to images on TV as though they’re real, their noses know better. Dogs may bark at on-screen animals, tilt their heads at interesting sounds, and run to the screen, but dogs interpret the world through smell.\nAccording toDr. Alisha Kidwell, a licensed veterinarian at North Carolina’s Cabarrus Animal Hospital, dogs rely heaviest on their senses of smell. Without accompanying scents, they likely don’t perceive TV as “real,” even if their actions sometimes suggest otherwise.\nDogs’ reactions are a fascinating mix of instinct and curiosity. When a dog barks at a lion on the screen or whines at the sound of a crying puppy, they are reacting to visual and auditory stimuli, rather than believing the lion or puppy is in the room with them. This behavior highlights sensitivity to sights, sounds, and emotions. For dogs, TV is an intriguing puzzle of moving shapes and sounds instead of a replica of the real world.\nTime for some screen-time ground rules, pups.\nWhy do some dogs watch TV and others don’t?\nNot all dogs are TV enthusiasts. A dog’s interest often comes down to personality, breed, and life experiences. Breeds known for their intelligence and heightened senses, such as Border Collies and German Shepherds, may be likelier to engage with TV because they are naturally curious and observant.\nA laid-back dog, especially older, more mellow dogs, may prefer to nap over staring at a screen. Puppies may show more interest in TV since they are still exploring and learning about the world. Puppies find new things fascinating, so a screen of moving shapes, colors, and noises would intrigue them.\nLeaving the TV on for your dog can be a good idea, especially if they are left home alone. The sounds and movement can provide mental stimulation, reducing boredom and easing separation anxiety. This can be helpful for dogs who exhibit destructive behavior when left alone.\nPet-specific streaming services, like DOGTV, are designed with calming visuals and sounds that cater to canine senses. Some dogs love cartoons because of the bright colors and exaggerated, animated movements.\nHowever, TV isn’t a substitute for interaction. Dogs thrive on human connection, physical affection, and play. So, while leaving a TV on may help for a few hours daily, it shouldn’t replace quality time with your dog.\nWatching TV is a normal (and often adorable) behavior for dogs. It shows they’re curious and in tune with their surroundings. Some dogs may bark or whine at the screen, while others will quietly observe. Both reactions are within the normal range for canine behavior.\nIf your dog doesn’t watch TV, that’s normal, too. Every dog is different, and they have their interests and quirks. Some don’t find the flickering screen as exciting as others.\nWhat does it say about your dog if they like watching TV?\nIf your dog enjoys watching TV, it shows curiosity and attentiveness. They’re picking up on visual and auditory cues, and engaging with their environment. Some dogs are natural problem-solvers and may watch TV with the same curiosity they’d show during a game of hide-and-seek with their favorite toy.\nWatching TV may also indicate a dog’s need for mental stimulation. If they zoom in on the screen, it may be time to introduce other engaging activities, like interactive toys or training sessions, to occupy their minds.\nWatching TV can be a charming mix of curiosity, personality, and sensory engagement for dogs. Their reactions to TV show how they experience the world, whether they bark at the screen, tilt their head in confusion, or ignore the screen entirely.\nNext time your dog curls up beside you for a series marathon, enjoy the moment. Think of it as another special time to strengthen the bond with your dog.\nFAQs\nBreeds known for their intelligence and energy, such as Border Collies, Poodles, and Terriers, are often more interested in watching TV.

There’s a reason the yoga pose is called “downward dog.”\nYour dog’s tail may wag furiously in this position while their eyes gleam excitedly. It’s a call for attention, a powerful form of canine body language with different meanings depending on the context.\nSome people think the dog bow is a fancy stretch, and they wouldn’t be entirely wrong. Dogs stretch all the time, especially when they’ve woken up from their umpteenth nap of the day. This is often called a “greeting stretch,” a casual way for pups to loosen their muscles after sleeping.\nIn contrast, a bow has more energy and intention. It’s a specific action used for communication, not a languid stretch. While a stretch is slow and leisurely, a bow is dynamic, sometimes energetic, and purposeful. It’s the difference between slouching on the couch and jumping up and down.\nYour dog knows when they want fun and games, but it’s importantyouunderstand. Here’s why.\nTop 5 reasons why your dog bows to you\nThis is the original meaning of the dog bow. A “play bow” is your dog’s way of enticing you to have fun. Dogs may use this stance on humans and other dogsto gear up for gameslike fetch, tag, or zoomie sessions. The play bow is meant to hype up a playmate.\nAccording toDr. Alisha Kidwell, a veterinarian from North Carolina’s Cabarrus Animal Hospital, dogs who regularly engage in play bowing tend to have better social skills with humans and other dogs. Think of it as the canine equivalent of asking, “Wanna hang out?”\nSometimes a bow can be a sign of submission. Your dog is conveying trust or expressing a peaceful intention. They are showing respect and acknowledging you as the leader of their pack (or the keeper of the kibble). This kind of bow is subdued, with soft eyes and a relaxed tail.\nHave you ever noticed your dog watching you stretch or exercise? Dogs are great at mimicking behaviors they see, especially if they get your attention. Your pup may not understand why you’re stretching or exercising, but they want to do it too — to make you laugh, smile, or pet them.\nWhen you come home after a long day out of the house, your dog’s bow could be a way of rolling out the proverbial red carpet. This bow is part of a happy greeting ritual, often paired with a wagging tail, a panting grin, and an excited bounce. They are genuinely delighted to see you.\nNot all bows are playful. Sometimes, a dog assumes a bow-like posture to relieve pain, especially in the abdomen, because a bow will stretch the abdominal muscles. This bow is called the “prayer position,” indicating bloating, digestive issues, or other uncomfortable medical mishaps. If your dog frequently bows without playful energy, consult a veterinarian.\nManaging expectations about your dog’s behavior makes for a good relationship\nHow to respond when your dog bows to you\nYour response to a dog bowing to you depends on the situation and their body language.\nWhen a dog bow is playful: Grab a toy, get on their level, and join the fun. Play fetch, tug-of-war, or chase them around the yard or house. Indulging their playful bow strengthens your bond, and gives them the mental and physical stimulation to release energy and fortify good health.\nWhen a dog bow is playful: Grab a toy, get on their level, and join the fun.

    "title": "Why You Should Do Breathwork With Your Dog—Really",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/breathwork-dogs"
  },
  "page_content": "Here’s your unsolicited health tip for the new year: Breathwork is not only good for us, it’s also good for the animals around us. I bet you’d agree that’s awesome news if you aren’t thinking,I’m good at breath, and I’m good at work — is that breathwork?\nNot exactly. At its most basic, breathwork is breathing intentionally. I describe it as active meditation, which is great for the herding-dog-type of humans out there who always need something to do, even when we’re supposed to be relaxing. (Umm, guilty as charged.) Breathwork is a mindfulness practice that can bring about a sense of grounding, boost energy, help identify and regulate emotions, release tension, and clarify thoughts. It can last for two minutes or 45 minutes — it’s not about the quantity but the quality of your breathing. You know, that thing that’s constantly happening and keeping us alive, whether we pay attention to it or not?\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nBefore we go further on the explain-train, could you do me a favor? Sit next to your dog and close your eyes… oh wait, you can’t read with your eyes closed, forget that. Open your eyes. Still, if it feels comfortable, take a deep and slow inhale through your nose, then exhale all the air out of your mouth. Do it again. One more time? Congratulations, you just helped your dog’s lifeandyour own.\nFor real. That can count as breathwork, and that can be enough to center you. I know it might sound kind of woo-woo. I’m admittedly kind of woo-woo. But here’s why: When I show up more aware and awake, when I’ve tended to my own wellbeing, I show up better for the dogs in my life, both my own and dogs I’m fostering. Technically, breathwork is a self-care tool, but it’s also something we can do for our dogs and for our relationship with them.\nBreathwork is good for your dog.\nSharing presence with someone can be an act of love. Serenading dogs or setting up a candlelight dinner might not cut it, but doing breathwork together is “dropping in” to meet them in the moment where they are. Generally, pups don’t carry around a past they dwell in or a future they worry about. They don’t slip into a time that is not happening now the way we humans do. Isn’t that what we appreciate most about our pets, how present they are? Breathwork offers a portal to join them there.\nIt feels comforting to sense somebody there, really there in the room with you. Dogs can feel our presence, they sense when our focus includes them or not. Just ask any dog walker who whips out their phone to check text messages how that impacts the other end of the leash. “Dogs understand eye contact. They understand when we are regarding them,” saysLaura London, professional dog trainer, licensedFamily Pawseducator, and certified canine massage practitioner. “When we regard somebody, they have identity,” London adds.\nLondon tells me dogs today are less scent-oriented than their ancestors. They no longer need to forage for food or where to sleep, so they no longer use their noses the way they were made to be used. In her opinion, this is a contributing factor to a rise in behavioral challenges. Theolfactory formation in dogsis designed with far more advanced functioning than is the case in humans. “When dogs use their noses more, they breathe more, and when they breathe more, they take in more information that can help them calm down. It’s why nosework is so powerful. Breathwork issort of like noseworkfor humans,” London points out.\nIn my experience, breathwork allows people to slow down and realize what they’re thinking in their heads and feeling in their bodies. This noticing sends a message to ourselves that we count. And once we know how to give this level of regard to ourselves, we can give it more easily to our pets, elevating the sense of inherent worth in both of us. On top of the fact that when we breathe mindfully beside our dogs we share the moment with them and give them loving attentiveness, we also acknowledge them giving the same back to us, recognizing the value they add in our lives.\nAnother reason breathwork is good for dogs?\nWhen we’re balanced instead of stressed, it sets the stage for improved behavior from our dogs and increases the likelihood that any training we do with them sticks. Ourserenity makes dogs more eagerto engage with us and follow our lead. “Dogs learn through association and context, so if you change your behavior, the association a dog has with you changes, and you can get a different relationship with different results. It’s why a dog is OK with one person and their particular speed, energy, and breath, but not OK with another person,” London tells me. “Generally, dogs prefer a calmer energy. I tell my clients, it’s not about the dog. People are my real clients, and mostly I have to teach them about the art of doing nothing. Showing their dog how to chill. That’s the thing.”\nDoing breathwork with your dog is a way to chill with your dog. It allows a dog to associate peace with their person, and a person to associate peace with their dog. The payoff can be huge in terms of our dogs’ overall demeanor (and our own).\nBreathwork is good for you.\nLet’s take a breathwork break. Inhale deeply but through the mouth this time, and exhale slowly through the mouth, too. Continue that breath pattern.\nFYI, when you do this, you’re also taking in more oxygen. Duh, you probably know that, but when we breathe fully, we nourish our bodies and brains with more air. Moreair usually translatesinto a less foggy mind and a greater aptitude in our muscles. When we are lost in unaware negative thinking spirals, we tend to breathe shallower and faster, causing less oxygen to get in, which means less nourishment for us, which means less clarity of the mind and less capacity for the body.Remember the age-old airplane analogy which insists we put our own oxygen mask on first? We have to be breathing to be at our best, and only then can we help anyone else.\nFellow certified trauma-informed breathwork facilitator,Brenda Winkle, who is also a certified trauma-informed somatic coach, energy healer and trauma-informed Reiki Master, tells me, “One of the benefits of doing breathwork with a facilitator is that youget to experience co-regulation.” That’s a term used to describe the process of supporting someone as they navigate emotions by offering them a nonjudgmental environment. Co-regulation ushers in connection, a witnessing container, and creates a blanket of trust. When we breathe with our dogs, they in essence co-regulate with us.\nMany emotions may arise during breathwork, whether that be anger, sadness, grief, joy, or something else, because intentional breathing can help move energy. “Co-regulation produces a sense of safety in the body,” Winkle says, which may be what allows stuck emotions to process and integrate. (Translation from woo-woo speak: It feels safe to process emotions in the presence of somebody who cares and isn’t trying to fix or control you.)\nPhysical symptoms like lightheadedness, temperature change, and tingling are also common during breathwork because changing our breathing affects our body. There arephysical benefits from doing breathwork, too, ranging from lowering blood pressure to improving immune functioning to promoting restful sleep.\nThe aha moment\nWhen I started doing breathwork, I noticed how my own blind and deaf senior Pitbull, Wally, would clomp over from wherever he was in the house to push the door open with his head, plop on the rug, and lay beside me. Now as a breathwork facilitator myself, I wonder if it feels good for him to hold space for me while I’m doing breathwork, just as I enjoy to hold space for others. I believe that as I breathe intentionally, my Pittie can detect my levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, dropping. (Again, translation: My dog’s nose can actually pick up on my lowering cortisol levels.)\nWinkle agrees. “I adopted my dog, Bentley, and was a couple of months in when I did a breathwork session. As I dropped into a slow breath, Bentley dropped in beside me. He was co-breathing and co-regulating with me,” she explains. She credits regular breathwork together with helping Bentley grow more confident, overcome anxiety, and adjust, all of which have contributed to the closeness they’ve developed.\nBreathwork is good for the relationship.\nYet one more reason that I recommend doing breathwork with your dog: It is good for the relationship between you. You are working with your dog when you work on yourself. You are bonding and nurturing the love between you when you implement self-care.\nWe know dogs communicate through body language. But how often do we hear them? And how often do we communicate through our own bodies in response, purposefully and clearly? Dogs learn to read our signs, they tune into us, even when we don’t realize what we’re demonstrating. “If we go in hot and our head isn’t clear, our breathing isn’t deep and our heart rate goes up. Our dogs will spike and sync up to that stress,” London says. “You take a dog with a high frequency and meet them with a high emotional state, and that dog won’t know how to come down. We won’t be able to tell what’s going on. We have to be a thermostat and set the temperature for both of us.”\n“If we don’t like the behavior our dog is exhibiting, we can look at how we are behaving because usually there is a tie,” Winkle corroborates. “My dog responds directly to my nervous system. If I am relaxed, he is. If I am agitated, he is. When it comes to dogs, if we don’t like how they’re behaving, it’s an opportunity to look in the mirror and ask how we’re showing up in our lives. It’s hard to do and not always comfortable, but usually the dog’s behavior is a symptom.”\nPerhaps breathwork is where dog behavior and self-help can intersect. OK, I admit, that wassuperwoo woo. But hear me out: There is an overlap between us and our dogs. Our wellbeing is interconnected with the wellbeing of the animals we take care of, because what we think determines what we feel, and what we feel determines what we do. We impact one another. Maybe we breathe with our dogs to listen to them better. Using this logic, when we breathe, we talk to them.\nRespiration, inspiration, motivation, transformation\nFor those who struggle to meditate because it feels boring, breathwork can offer a nice alternative. For others, breathwork might be too intense. I invite you to get curious and experiment with wellness modalities. Search for certified facilitators who align with what you’re seeking, or use an app with a varied resource library, likeInsightTimer.\nEven if all you do is sit beside your dog and lay a hand on their belly (ifthey like that) and observe the rise and fall of their breath, and observe the same in yourself, that simple awareness of inhales and exhales could mean a lot for you, for your beloved dog, and for the dynamic you share.\nReferences\nAnastasio, Alexandra. “Keeping Calm in a Crisis: Why It’s Important for Both You and Your Dog.”American Kennel Club, May 3, 2018,www.akc.org/expert-advice/advice/keeping-calm-in-a-crisis/.\nAnastasio, Alexandra. “Keeping Calm in a Crisis: Why It’s Important for Both You and Your Dog.”American Kennel Club, May 3, 2018,www.akc.org/expert-advice/advice/keeping-calm-in-a-crisis/.\nFincham, Guy William, et al. “Effect of Breathwork on Stress and Mental Health: A Meta-Analysis of Randomised-Controlled Trials.”Scientific Reports, vol. 13, no. 1, 9 Jan. 2023,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-27247-y.\nFincham, Guy William, et al. “Effect of Breathwork on Stress and Mental Health: A Meta-Analysis of Randomised-Controlled Trials.”Scientific Reports, vol. 13, no. 1, 9 Jan. 2023,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-27247-y.\n“How Shallow Breathing Affects the Body and Mind — Calm Blog.”Calm Blog,www.calm.com/blog/shallow-breathing.\n“How Shallow Breathing Affects the Body and Mind — Calm Blog.”Calm Blog,www.calm.com/blog/shallow-breathing.\nSalamon, Maureen. “Co-Regulation: Helping Children and Teens Navigate Big Emotions.”Harvard Health, 3 Apr. 2024,www.health.harvard.edu/blog/co-regulation-helping-children-and-teens-navigate-big-emotions-202404033030.\nSalamon, Maureen. “Co-Regulation: Helping Children and Teens Navigate Big Emotions.”Harvard Health, 3 Apr. 2024,www.health.harvard.edu/blog/co-regulation-helping-children-and-teens-navigate-big-emotions-202404033030.",

Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nUnderstanding why puppies bark\n“Dogs bark at strangers due to their evolutionary roots,” says Colby Julien, an animal behaviorist and dog trainer atGeo-Sniffing, an outdoor scent pod discovery game for dogs. “Wolves howled to establish territory and avoid conflict.”\nIt makes sense then if you’re part of the wolf pack, your puppy will bark to defend you. Keep in mind that some breeds bark more than others. Unfortunately, smaller breeds favored for living in close quarters, such as Corgis, Chihuahuas, and terriers, tend to bark the most.\nUnderstanding triggers for barking\nJulien says puppies will often bark when they’re bored. “First, check if your dog has enough to do,” she says.\nOverstimulation is another reason puppies bark. If puppies get too excited or their environment is over-stimulating, they’ll express their distress — loudly.\n“This is why it’s important to teach puppies to relax and not overwork them,” Julien says. “Have your puppy sit next to you while watching TV or working on a computer. Reward them any time they lie down and relax.”\nPuppies will also bark to get your attention. Because they’re so cute, their parents will unintentionally reward that barking with a cuddle; therefore, attention barking is usually a pet parent’s fault, Julien says. Eye contact, vocalization, or, worse, yelling, ‘rewards’ the barking with attention.\n“Another common mistake is ignoring the barking at first but then giving in out of frustration. This teaches the dog that barking longer works, so they’ll keep at it even more next time. The more you do this, the harder it will be to break it,” Julien says.\nDogs are territorial and have evolved to bark when someone approaches ‘their’ house. Called ‘stranger barking,’ Julien says this behavior is determined by the size of a dog’s ‘bubble,’ or territory. Different dogs have different-sized bubbles. “So this could be someone walking on the sidewalk on their way to school,” she says. “The worst part is this behavior becomes self-reinforcing when barking ‘works’ by making people continue walking away.”\nHow to train your puppy not to bark\nPositive reinforcement trainingcan be used if barking or other unwanted behaviors arise at any age. When your pup is barking, take a deep breath and wait for the barking to stop. This may take a while, so be patient. As agonizing as it is to ignore a barking puppy, try to wait for even a short pause in the barking. When your pup exhibits the desired behavior — in this case, they stop barking — immediately reward them with a treat. Eventually, they learn that notbarking brings good things.\nWhen they’ve mastered this skill, lengthen the time between when they stop barking and when you give them a treat. As they get better at recognizing the benefits of positive reinforcement, make it fun by varying the amount of time before you give them the treat.\nWhen your pup enters adolescence at around six months, they may startgetting sassyand barking more. Like adolescents of another species, they’re testing boundaries. They might begin noticing people walking by the window or even the sound of a neighbor’s footfalls in the apartment next door.\nTake advantage of your puppy’s energy and capacity for learning to teach the quiet command (your neighbors will thank you). When your puppy starts barking, say “Quiet!” once in a strong, friendly voice. Then, without repeating the command, wait until they stop barking and immediately shower them with praise and treats.\nAs with positive reinforcement, once your pup understands the quiet command, gradually lengthen the amount of time from when they stop barking to when you reward them. Initially this should be just a few seconds. Eventually, issue the rewards intermittently but consistently so they understand that they’ll be rewarded every other time or every third time, but not all the time.\nTime-outs remove your puppy from what they want most: you. Your timing is essential to effective time-outs. The second your puppy starts barking, remove yourself from the room and close the door, or remove your puppy to a crate or confined space. Be consistent and do this every time they start barking. If not, you’ll confuse your pup. You may need to set aside a day to enact numerous time-outs, but eventually, your puppy will learn that barking leads you to withdraw your attention.\nStart by leaving your dog alone for a short time, maybe 30 seconds. Increase the time gradually by increments. Continue using positive reinforcement techniques; as soon as you hear the barking stop, return to your puppy and reward them. If you don’t, they won’t learn the cause and effect of time-outs.\nWhile your puppy is in time-out, stay nearby but out of sight. If the barking continues for several minutes, you can step into sight, which may precipitate a surprised pause in the barking. Immediately reward your puppy by releasing them from the room or the crate. If the barking resumes (and it will at first), repeat the process.\nIf your puppy starts barking while confined to a crate or a room, try not to let them out until they’ve stopped barking, even for a second, then reward them with a treat or a puzzle toy. The best strategy for keeping your pup quiet during downtime is to tire them out before you put them in the crate.\nJulien says redirecting your puppy while they’re barking is difficult because they’ll most likely ignore what you offer. Managing the environment is key: Block the view with curtains and move the chair or couch they’re climbing on to look out the window. Julien also suggests playing background noise, such as YouTube videos of kids playing, to desensitize your puppy to common sounds in their environment.\nWhat’s more, a tired puppy is a quiet puppy. Exercise is one of the most effective methods for keeping your pup quiet. A tiring walk or long-lasting treats such a Kong stuffed with peanut butter or a puzzle toy will occupy your pup and keep them from barking at times when you need quiet.\nWhen should you seek professional help from a trainer?\nOften, when your puppy barks, they’re too excited to pay attention to you. In this case, Julien says to schedule a training session to work on impulse control games so your dog learns the necessary skills to calm down after they get triggered.\nA trainer can also help you design a program of games, obedience training, tricks, and agility exercises to keep boredom barking from turning into destructive behavior. “Working dogs like Border Collies will become anxious from lack of stimulation and will find any way to fulfill the need for stimulation. Barking is the least of your problems with a bored dog. Destructive behaviors are sure to follow,” Julien says.\nYoucanlive in a quiet house again.\nWhat Is the three-bark rule?\nBarking is a communication tool puppies use to convey how they’re feeling and get our attention. We don’t want to communicate to them that what they’re feeling isn’t important, which is where the “three-bark rule” comes in. This dog-training method allows the dog to bark up to three times to alert their parents about someone at the door, for example. After three barks, apply the quiet command or reward them when they stop barking.\nReferences\n“How to Stop Territorial Barking | Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine.”Vet.tufts.edu,vet.tufts.edu/news-events/news/how-stop-territorial-barking.\n“How to Stop Territorial Barking | Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine.”Vet.tufts.edu,vet.tufts.edu/news-events/news/how-stop-territorial-barking.",

There are plenty of reasons for this charming (sometimes inconvenient) behavior, so let’s delve into why dogs are drawn to sleeping on your feet while you snooze.\nMain takeaways\nDogs sleep at your feet because they see you as their pack leader.

Many pet parents report that their pups gravitate toward thefoot of the bed during sleep. The foot of the bed is considered the sweet spot: Close enough to you for comfort, but far enough away to avoid an accidental elbow to the face during midnight stretches.\nSleeping at your feet is normal dog behavior, rooted in instincts that date back to their wild ancestors. However, as with most canine quirks, there’s more to it than meets the eye (or paw).\nIt’s a personal preference, but here are the pros and cons.\nWhy does my dog sleep at my feet?\nDogs are pack animals. In the wild, pack animals stick together for comfort, safety, warmth, and survival. By snoozing at your feet, your dog designates you as their pack leader, and they feel secure in your presence. The foot of the bed offers a strategic position where your dog can monitor you and the surroundings. They have an eye on the door and windows to ensure safety.\nYour bed is prime real estate — soft, warm, and way better than any dog bed on the market. But your feet? That’s where your scent lingers, and your dog is obsessed with your smell. According toDr. Alisha Kidwell, a veterinarian at North Carolina’s Cabarrus Animal Hospital with more than a decade of canine experience and expertise, a human’s scent is a dog’s version of a weighted blanket. It’s familiar and soothing, keeping them calm when things go bump in the night.\nWhen the temperature drops, your dog may sidle up to your feet for a dose of human-generated heat. This is particularly true with smaller breeds such as Chihuahuas and Dachshunds.\nLiving with a dog is like living with a security system. Dogs can act on signs of danger bysleeping at the foot of the bed. This behavior is typical in protective breeds such as Rottweilers, Belgian Malinois, and German Shepherds. Even if the most significant threat in your house is a rogue cat, your dog takes their job seriously.\nDogs are territorial creatures. Sleeping at your feet is their way of marking you as theirs. The glands in their paws release scent markers, claiming the foot of the bed as their domain. There will be a hierarchy if you have multiple dogs in your home. The “big dog” will first claim your feet as their spot on the bed, and the other dogs will respect that position.\nIf you haven’t set clear boundaries, your bed becomes the default spot for yourdogs to sleep. The foot of the bed offers a balance between closeness and independence, a win-win for your dog. If you’re not fond of nighttime toe warmers, give your dog a comfortable alternative, like a plush dog bed or blanket-lined crate.\nDogs seek comfort when they feel stressed or insecure. Sleeping at your feet allows them to seek comfort, staying close without overwhelming you with clinginess. Thunderstorms, fireworks, or routine changes can be anxiety triggers that push dogs to want to be around you for comfort. The same can be said for anxious, newly adopted dogs. Sleeping at the foot of the bed may help them adjust to a new environment.\nDogs are clever. If lying at your feet gets them belly rubs, scratches, and praise, they will return for more. Positive reinforcement works wonders, even when it’s unintentional.\nDogs need more sleep than humans. Here’s how much is healthy.\nIs it OK to let your dog sleep at your feet?\nThe short answer is…it depends. For many, sharing a bed with their dog is a comforting ritual that strengthens the human-canine bond. For others, this is a resounding no. Hence, the decision is based on personal preference.\nHowever, there are a few considerations.\nHygiene: If your dog spends most of the day outdoors, ensure they are clean before climbing into bed. Nobody wants muddy paw prints and grime on their sheets.\nHygiene: If your dog spends most of the day outdoors, ensure they are clean before climbing into bed.

The concept of“alpha” or dominance has largely been debunked, but your dog’s trust in you does inform their sleeping habits.\nThis position lets your dog keep an eye on the surroundings while staying close to you, fulfilling their protective instincts.\nReferences\n“Why Do Dogs Sleep at Your Feet – [Vet Explains Pets].”Vetexplainspets.com, 2024,vetexplainspets.com/why-do-dogs-sleep-at-your-feet.

  "page_content": "Did you just bring your new puppy home? Are you hearing sounds you have never heard a dog make before? Puppies can be very vocal as they are developing and different sounds can communicate different needs.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat sounds do puppies make?\nBringing home your puppy is an exciting time, and being prepared with all the supplies is a great way to be ready before your puppy comes home. It is also important to learn about puppy behaviors so that you can be sure to know what is happening with your puppy, and how you can best help them adjust to their new environment. A large part of puppy behaviors is puppy vocalizations. Just as a baby communicates its needs and wants through cries, a puppy’s vocalizations are used in a similar way.\nA puppy or dog barking can mean many different things. Puppies may bark when they see another dog, and they want to play. They may bark when they see another dog because they are scared and want that other dog to stay away. When playing with another dog a puppy may bark as a form of communication. Barking may occur when a puppy is looking for attention.\nOne example would be when you are distracted on your phone and your puppy is in a playful mood. They may bark to say, “Hey! Play with me!” Be careful what you reinforce when a puppy is barking. It may be cute when they are little and less loud, but as they get bigger the barking may become bothersome. If your dog is barking during play, you can pause each time they bark and wait a few seconds before engaging again. If you are consistent, you will help train your dog to play quietly.\nLoneliness can be another reason why you may find your puppy barks. If you leave them in another room or you arewatching them from your cameraand see that they are barking, this is likely because they are having a hard time being alone. If this occurs it may be best to begin crate training. It is always a good idea to work with a trainer when difficult behaviors arise with your puppy; this will help set them up for success in the future as an adult dog.\nA puppy whine can be hard to resist, and it may make you want to snuggle your puppy. But you must be strong. Whining is another behavior that is a form of communication. When your puppy whines, they may be trying to tell you something. In puppyhood, whining is meant to let the mother dog know something is not right or that the puppy needs something. Puppies may also whine when they need to use the bathroom.\nIt’s best to keep your puppy on aschedule for bathroom breaksas you learn their potty cues. Always remember to take your puppy to the bathroom shortly after they play, eat or sleep.  Is your puppy acting different and whining? This may warrant a vet visit, be sure to pay close attention to any behavior changes. Puppies can easily get into trouble by eating something they shouldn’t, so be sure to always have eyes on your puppy and if you can not watch them make sure they are secured in a puppy safe area.\nWith your puppy at home, does it sound like you have a wolf for a pet instead of a dog? Any sounds a puppy makes is a form of communication, and howling is no different. If your puppy is alone in their area, and they are howling, they may be lonely.\nWhen puppies are taken from their mom and siblings, there is an adjustment period. They may howl when they are left alone for long periods of time because they are lonely and do not know how to comfort themselves yet. Depending on the breed of dog you have, they may howl as an instinct. Some breeds that are especially known for howling are the Basset Hound, Malamute, Husky, and Beagle breeds, to name a few.\nThe beginning of puppy parenthood can be rough, but it does get better — especially when you implement this advice.\nDevelopment of vocalizations\nPuppies begin making sounds around two to three weeks of age. At the start, puppy sounds may be mostly grunts and whines. As they continue to grow they begin to develop yips and barks. Some puppies take some time to find their voice, but by the age of sixteen weeks they have usually figured it out.\nSigns your puppy may be stressed by sounds\nNew sights and sounds can be scary to young puppies, especially during fear periods. Exposing them to as many different types of sights and sounds is an important part of socializing your puppy. If your puppy hears or sees something and begins showing signs of being stressed out, it is important to help them get more comfortable with what they are scared of at a young age in order to help prevent a fearful adult dog in the future.\nSome signs your puppy may be stressed include lip licking, panting, drooling, hiding, trembling, and pinning their ears back. Depending on the level of fear your puppy has it may be best to enlist the help of a trainer. In order to help your puppy grow into a healthy adult, it is important to build good associations from the beginning.\nHow to introduce sounds to your puppy\nLoud sounds can be scary! There are so many things your puppy has never heard before. If possible, it is good to introduce new sounds to your puppy in a controlled environment before the sounds become scary.\nThink about where you live and what sounds may be intimidating to a young puppy. Thunder and fireworks are a good place to start, or maybe construction sounds. Begin by finding a recording of the sound you want to help desensitize your puppy to. You want to begin to build a positive association towards the scary sound. Food is a great way to help build a positive association—using yummy treats or their kibble is a great way to help.\nStart by feeding your puppy something yummy and playing the scary sound at a very quiet level. Over a period of time as you see your puppy is comfortable with the sound you can make it louder. One way to tell your puppy is comfortable is that they are still eating and have not stopped. The minute you see your puppy begin to show any of the stress signals that were listed in the above paragraph that is how you know it is becoming too much for your puppy and you should dial it back. You may need to say at a certain sound level for a few sessions or a few days depending on the temperament of your puppy.\nFAQs\nUnderstanding the reason why your puppy is whining will determine if you should respond or not. If you think that your puppy is whining for attention, then it is best to ignore your puppy. If your puppy is whining due to fear or discomfort, then it is best to respond to your puppy and console them or try to figure out what is wrong.\nPlaying classical music is a great way to help comfort your puppy or even your full-grown dog! Did you know there is special classical music made for dogs that can help calm them? Playing classical music when you are out is a great way to help soothe your puppy when you are not around.\nA puppy may whimper if they are scared or hurt.\nIf your puppy is barking a lot, they may be bored. Making sure your puppy has the right amount of stimulation is important to have a happy quiet puppy.\nIt is good to take your puppy on one or more unstructured walks a day. An unstructured walk is when you follow your puppy’s lead. Sniffing is an important behavior that your dog should be allowed to engage in. Allowing your puppy to go on a  ten minute “sniffari” is better than taking your dog on a structured one hour walk. Sniffing will tire your puppy out and they will take a nice long nap. Another way to help prevent your puppy from barking is to help teach them to settle, this is where proper crate training is important. You can also use chew toys and treats to help your puppy calm down andprevent barking.\nIt's time to reframe the situation.\nReferences\nCutler, Janet H., et al. “Puppy Socialization Practices of a Sample of Dog Owners from across Canada and the United States.”Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, vol. 251, no. 12, 15 Dec. 2017, pp. 1415–1423,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.251.12.1415.‌\nCutler, Janet H., et al. “Puppy Socialization Practices of a Sample of Dog Owners from across Canada and the United States.”Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, vol. 251, no. 12, 15 Dec. 2017, pp. 1415–1423,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.251.12.1415.‌\nFrank, Diane, et al. “Puppy Behaviours When Left Home Alone: A Pilot Study.”Applied Animal Behaviour Science, vol. 104, no. 1-2, Apr. 2007, pp. 61–70,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2006.05.003.

  "page_content": "You're working at your desk minding your own business when there it is ... an adorable yet needy paw settles on your thigh. Your pup is fed, walked, and moments ago was happily gnawing on their favorite toy. So, what gives? Why do dogs paw at us?\nDogs use pawing to express a wide range of emotions, from excitement and love to a gentle nudge for attention or a reminder for dinner time. This instinctual behavior is rooted in their social nature and offers an attention-grabbing way to interact and convey their needs to their human companions. But what should you do — or shouldn’t do — when your dog keeps pawing at you?\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nYour dog’s Velcro habits are cute—but not always convenient.\nHow do dogs connect with people?\nEven with a language barrier, humans and pups have beenbesties for literal centuries. How do we do it? By listening to our dogs’ other forms of communication: expressive barks, playful tail wags, and soulful gazes.\n“Dogs even use their paws much like we use our hands — to get attention, express a desire for something, or initiate play,” says Dr. Sabrina Kong, a veterinarian atJules Veterinary Centerin California. In more urgent situations, they might insistently paw.\nTurns out, it’s no coincidence that dogs seem to mirror our behaviors, like using their paws to connect with us. Studies show thatdogs adjust their communicationbased on social dynamics — humans often use physical touch in communication and dogs naturally pick up on the cue.\nReasons why dogs paw at you\nNeed help deciphering your dog’s pawing? Dr. Kong breaks down the most common reasons for pawing behaviors in dogs:\nWhen your dog wants your attentionnow, they may discover that pawing at you gets your attention the quickest. Kinda like a human toddler poking you while you’re engrossed in a grown-up conversation.\nDr. Kong says dogs who are pawing simply to sayI love youwill have a relaxed posture including naturally-positioned ears, a gently wagging tail, and a soft gaze.\nDid the mail person just arrive and you didn't even flinch?Gasp.Your doggo clearly needs to share the exciting news. Look for tell-tale signs like perked-up ears, a wagging tail, and bouncy movements.\nIf you're not sure what your dog needs, it's always a good idea to run through your basic care checklist, like when you took them out last, if they had their morning play sesh, or if dinnertime crept up without your realizing.\nIf your dog paws at you and you respond by patting their head or giving them a toy,  they’re more likely to keep pawing at you. That's positive reinforcement. It’s a good tool in reward-based training but a slippery slope when giving in to unwanted behaviors.\nWhen your dog feels anxious or stressed, pawing can be their way of seeking comfort and security, similar to how we might hold a loved one’s hand. However, be mindful of signs like tense body language, avoidance of eye contact, or growling, which could indicate aggression or fear. Either way, it's important toaddress the underlying anxietyrather than simply responding to your pup’s pawing.\nPlayful pups express themselves differently. Some paw excitedly, while others opt for theclassic play bow. Even if you’ve only got fifteen minutes before your next Zoom meeting, it might be time for a quick break. No time to spare until your after-work play session? Along-lasting chew toyorchallenging puzzlecan help keep your dog busy.\nIf the pawing behavior is out of the norm for your dog, accompanied by other changes such as a lack of appetite, increased vocalizations, or lack of interest in their favorite activities, it could point to underlying health conditions. Consult your veterinarian to rule out any medical issues before caulking the pawing up to behavioral needs.\nWhy do dogs paw at other dogs?\nFiguring out what your dog is up to is all about context and body language. Some dogs paw at other dogs as a playful gesture, although it may come off as rude to some playmates. This behavior is more often seen in smaller dogs who don’t like toplay roughor puppies or are still learning proper etiquette. Playful pawing is accompanied by friendly body language, such as:\nBowing down, with the rump in the air and a wagging tail\nBowing down, with the rump in the air and a wagging tail\nRelaxed facial muscles, possibly displaying a ‘grin” or an open mouth\nRelaxed facial muscles, possibly displaying a ‘grin” or an open mouth\nPerked up ears\nPerked up ears\nPlayful barks\nPlayful barks\nOn the other hand, a dog may paw at another as a sign of dominance or to warn them to back away.

Dogs cannot see anything in total darkness — no animal can see without light — but they still maintain vision when it might seem impossibly dark to a person.\nFollowing the path of light as it enters a dog’s eye can help you to understand how they see and what adaptations have helped improve their night vision. As light enters a dog’s eye, it encounters the following structures:\nCornea:The clear surface of the eye is actually a very specialized version of epithelium (or skin). Its large size and domed surface allow light to enter from different angles. Many of themost common eye problemsin dogs originate here.\nCornea:The clear surface of the eye is actually a very specialized version of epithelium (or skin). Its large size and domed surface allow light to enter from different angles. Many of themost common eye problemsin dogs originate here.\nAnterior chamber:This area in the front of the eye is filled with aqueous humor, a clear liquid that allows light to pass through. This liquid exerts pressure on the cornea and helps give the eye its shape.Inflammation in this chambercan reduce that pressure.\nAnterior chamber:This area in the front of the eye is filled with aqueous humor, a clear liquid that allows light to pass through.

The pupil gets larger in low-light conditions so that the amount of incoming light is maximized.\nPupil:The size of this open space is controlled by the iris, which dilates or contracts to allow more or less light in. The pupil gets larger in low-light conditions so that the amount of incoming light is maximized.\nLens:This clear disc allows light to pass into the back half of the eye. It can change shape to focus the light on the very back of the eye, where the light-sensing tissues are.Cataracts develop hereand decrease the amount of light entering the back of the eye.\nLens:This clear disc allows light to pass into the back half of the eye.

This also helps maintain the shape of the eye and carries nutrition to some of the tissues of the eye.\nPosterior chamber:The back part of the eye is filled with clear, jelly-like vitreous humor. This also helps maintain the shape of the eye and carries nutrition to some of the tissues of the eye.\nRetina:This is where the magic happens. The retina is covered in rods and cones, which are specialized light receptors. Rods are great at picking up very faint light but don’t provide great visual detail. Cones need more light to function but are better at delivering information about color and fine detail.\nRetina:This is where the magic happens. The retina is covered in rods and cones, which are specialized light receptors. Rods are great at picking up very faint light but don’t provide great visual detail. Cones need more light to function but are better at delivering information about color and fine detail.\nTapetum lucidum:Sitting behind the sensory cells of the retina, the reflective tapetum lucidum bounces light that was not picked up by a rod or cone back at those cells for a second chance at activating them.\nTapetum lucidum:Sitting behind the sensory cells of the retina, the reflective tapetum lucidum bounces light that was not picked up by a rod or cone back at those cells for a second chance at activating them.\nNow that you understand how dogs’ vision works, it’s easier to spot the different adaptations that improve their night vision. A dog’s cornea occupies a much larger area of the eye’s surface than people’s, allowing more light to enter. Their pupils can open wider as well, meaning that more of the light that enters is transmitted to the retina.\nA dog’s retina has a higher proportion of rods than cones, giving priority to low-light vision. These rods are also located in the area of the retina that is most likely to be hit by light, increasing the chance that they will be activated. The tapetum lucidum reflects the light that’s missed by the rods and cones back at them, improving low-light vision.\nSo, the answer to “Can dogs see well in the dark?” is a resounding “Yes!” Their eyes evolved to prioritize tracking fast-moving objects in a variety of lighting situations. This improved reaction time and performance in low light comes at a cost though. Dogs see far fewer color varieties than people do, and their vision is much less sharp than ours.\nCan dogs see in the dark better than humans?\nDogs have superior vision to humans in the dark. This is because people’s eyes have some key differences from dogs’ eyes, such as:\nSmaller corneas\nSmaller corneas\nSmaller pupils\nSmaller pupils\nRelatively more cones than rods\nRelatively more cones than rods\nIncreased cone density in the focal area\nIncreased cone density in the focal area\nNo tapetum lucidum\nNo tapetum lucidum\nThese differences make it harder for people to see in the dark. Humans do have some advantages, though: we’re able to see more colors and visualize objects in more detail — as long as there’s enough light for us to see. Dogs don’t rely on vision as their primary way of experiencing the world, so visual acuity isn’t as important to them. Their sense of smell goes well beyond what people can imagine, and dogs use sight as a way to supplement what they’re picking up through smell.\nIt’s not known for sure what colors dogs can see in the dark, but it’s likely that their low-light vision is not very colorful because of the relatively high numbers of rods providing visual information. Cones, which are responsible for color vision, require several hundred times the amount of light to activate than rods do. In very low-light situations, dogs likely see primarily in grayscale.\nA common question vets get is “What do dogs see when they look at the world?” It’s hard to know how exactly each species processes their vision. In light, dogs likely see things primarily in shades of blue and yellow, which are the colors their cones can detect best. This type of color vision is similar to that of a person with red-green colorblindness.\nBecause of the preponderance of rods and the presence of the tapetum lucidum, dogs’ vision has less acuity than people’s. It’s estimated that they have 20:70 vision in the best-case scenario, meaning that they see an object twenty feet away with the same level of detail a person with normal vision would see it at seventy feet away.\nDogs can see in the dark, but cats have even better vision in the dark than dogs do. The tapetum lucidum in a cat’s eye covers more area and is more reflective than a dog’s. As crepuscular animals,cats’ eyesevolved to allow them to hunt best at dawn and dusk, when light levels are low.\nSo, how well can dogs see in the dark overall? Dogs’ night vision falls between that of cats and humans, allowing them some advantages over cats in full light, but some disadvantages in low light. Both dogs and cats see better in the dark than people do. It’s likely that your dog is very confused about why you didn’t see that table you stubbed your toe on when you’re stumbling around at night.\nCats can see details in environments six times darker than those that appear completely black to humans. Dogs land somewhere in the middle, possessing night vision superior to ours but not quite matching the impressive capabilities of felines. Dogs evolved the ability to see well under low-light conditions but maintained solid daylight vision as well. This gives them the ability to track objects in most natural conditions, so they are not limited to hunting during a particular time of day.\nWhy do dogs’ eyes glow in the dark?\nMost dog parents have seen their dog’s eyes seeming to light up in a dark room or during a nighttime walk. Dogs’ eyes don’t produce their own light — they don’t truly glow in the dark — but they’re good at reflecting what little light is available. The tapetum lucidum reflects light that wasn’t absorbed by the sensory cells of the retina back at those cells to give the photons a second chance at being absorbed.\nWhatever light isn’t caught on this second go-round continues through the eye to the lens, where it is refracted, giving it an eerie glow. This glow is often yellow to greenish, which is the color of the tapetum in older dogs. Puppies often have a more bluish tapetum that changes color as they mature.\nFinal thoughts\nAlthough broadly very similar in structure, dog and human eyes have some key differences that allow dogs to maintain sight in many types of light. While their vision may not be the sharpest or most vibrant, it allows dogs to function in much lower light levels than people can. Combined with their superior sense of smell, dogs’ sight allows them to navigate in dark environments with little issue.\nIt’s not all black and white.\nReferences\nByosiere, Sarah-Elizabeth, et al. “What Do Dogs (Canis Familiaris) See?

  "page_content": "If you’ve had a dog for a while, you’ve probably heard them cough after drinking water. Every dog does it — just like we occasionally cough after swallowing something. Normally, it’s nothing to worry about. However, you may start worrying about your dog if the coughing becomes frequent.\nYour dog can cough excessively after drinking water for numerous reasons. A pet parent needs to know why and what to do if it gets severe. That’s because in some cases there are serious causes that need to be addressed for your pup’s health and happiness.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nMain takeaways\nMany dogs cough after drinking, and that’s normal and requires no treatment.\nMany dogs cough after drinking, and that’s normal and requires no treatment.\nBut there are also serious illnesses that can cause dogs to cough.\nBut there are also serious illnesses that can cause dogs to cough.\nYou should see your vet if there are additional symptoms accompanying the cough.\nYou should see your vet if there are additional symptoms accompanying the cough.\nHome remedies and vet treatments for a coughing dog depend on the severity of the cough.\nHome remedies and vet treatments for a coughing dog depend on the severity of the cough.\nWhy dogs cough after drinking water\nThere are many reasons why dogs cough after drinking water. We will explain 12 of the most common ones.\nYour dog’s windpipe (the common name for the trachea) is the tube that carries air from their throat to their lungs. There’s another tube-like structure alongside the trachea called the esophagus, which carries food and water from their mouth to their stomach. If water goes down the trachea instead of the esophagus, it will cause a dog to cough. This most often happens when your dog drinks too quickly or at an awkward angle. Coughing is a reflexive action to clear and protect the airways.\nReverse sneezing — often mistaken for coughing — is like a sneeze, but the air comes in the nose instead of out of it. It is usually a harmless condition caused by irritation or inflammation in the soft palate or throat. Stimulation of sensitive areas by drinking water may be the cause of this reaction. It can be scary to hear and see, but it is usually harmless. If it starts happening too frequently, see your vet.\nCoughing after drinking water can be caused by infections such as kennel cough or pneumonia. Other symptoms may include lethargy, fever, or nasal discharge. You should take your pup to the vet if they have any of these symptoms.\nA collapsed trachea in dogs is a condition where the cartilage rings that support the trachea (or windpipe) weaken, causing the trachea to become flattened. This can lead to airway obstruction, resulting in coughing and breathing difficulties. Here are the primary causes of, and contributing factors to, this:\nGenetics\nGenetics\nAge\nAge\nObesity\nObesity\nChronic respiratory conditions\nChronic respiratory conditions\nEnvironmental factors\nEnvironmental factors\nCongenital defects\nCongenital defects\nHormonal imbalances\nHormonal imbalances\nYour dog could also have problems with the actual anatomy of their trachea.\nDogs are famous for eating anything they can get their noses into. They go through trash cans, eat parts of toys, and chew on plants and outdoor bushes. It’s not uncommon for foreign objects to become stuck in a dog’s throat or esophagus. If that dog then drinks water, this can increase the irritation caused by the foreign body and cause coughing. Additional symptoms can include difficulty swallowing, pawing at the mouth, and gagging. This is a vet emergency.\nIf your dog is having difficulty swallowing for any reason, drinking water may cause them to aspirate water into their lungs through the trachea. This can lead to aspiration pneumonia, which is a very serious condition. Symptoms include persistent coughing, labored breathing, and lethargy. If this appears to be happening, take them to a vet right away.\nIf your dog is allergic to food or has environmental allergens, their throat can become irritated. If your dog drinks with an irritated throat, that can make them cough. This will necessitate identifying the allergen so it can be avoided. Your vet will also probably prescribe medications to help manage allergy symptoms.\nUnfortunately, dogs get cancer, including tumors in their respiratory or digestive tracts. This can cause physical obstruction or irritation, leading to coughing after drinking. Additional symptoms include coughing up blood, weight loss, and difficulty breathing. This requires immediate vet attention.\nBronchitis in dogs refers to the inflammation of the bronchial tubes, which are a part of the lungs. This can be caused by several factors.\nInfections:Viral, bacterial, or fungal infections such as kennel cough, a contagious respiratory infection\nInfections:Viral, bacterial, or fungal infections such as kennel cough, a contagious respiratory infection\nAllergies: Irritation from environmental allergens such as pollen, dust, mold, or smoke — which irritate the respiratory system\nAllergies: Irritation from environmental allergens such as pollen, dust, mold, or smoke — which irritate the respiratory system\nIrritants: Prolonged exposure to smoke, strong chemicals, or air pollution that irritates the airways and causes inflammation\nIrritants: Prolonged exposure to smoke, strong chemicals, or air pollution that irritates the airways and causes inflammation\nParasites: Lungworms and other worms that infect the respiratory system\nParasites: Lungworms and other worms that infect the respiratory system\nUnderlying conditions: Heart disease or tracheal collapse which increases a dog’s bronchitis risk\nUnderlying conditions: Heart disease or tracheal collapse which increases a dog’s bronchitis risk\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): Long-term respiratory problems that develop into chronic bronchitis in older dogs or those with underlying health issues\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): Long-term respiratory problems that develop into chronic bronchitis in older dogs or those with underlying health issues\nImmune system disorders: Autoimmune conditions that affect the respiratory tract\nImmune system disorders: Autoimmune conditions that affect the respiratory tract\nCanine heartworm disease is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition that can affect the heart and lungs. It can cause coughing, especially after drinking and exercise. There are preventative medications you can give your dog and tests to make sure your dog doesn’t suffer from heartworms.\nThere are several different types of canine heart disease. To know for sure if your dog has a heart condition — and which one it is — they’ll need a cardiac ultrasound (or echocardiogram). A murmur is often heard when a dog has a heart condition. Other symptoms include difficulty breathing, fatigue, and possibly a swollen abdomen. There can be fluid buildup in the lungs, leading to coughing that may worsen by drinking water. Vet intervention is needed right away.\nA collapsing trachea is a common cause of coughing in smaller dog breeds and may be aggravated by drinking water. Treatment options include weight management, medications to reduce inflammation, and in severe cases, surgical intervention.\nFrom toxins to allergies, let’s get down to business and problem-solve this.\nHow to determine between a normal cough and one that needs medical care\nAs previously mentioned, there are many times when a dog’s cough is completely normal and doesn’t need treatment. One example isreverse sneezing. But there are other times when failing to get help from a vet can be detrimental to their health.\nVeterinary care is essential if the cough persists — or worsens over time — and is accompanied by other symptoms such as lethargy, loss of appetite, and difficulty breathing. Make a video to show your vet, and keep a record of when, and how often, the coughing occurs.\nHow do vets treat coughing in dogs?\nThere are manydifferent treatmentsfor coughing in dogs. If the cause of this is an infection, the treatment may be antibiotics. If it’s bronchitis, the treatment may be anti-inflammatory medication. Some circumstances, such as a tracheal collapse or a tumor, may involve surgery. Diagnostic tools like X-rays, blood tests, and endoscopies may be used to pinpoint the issue.\nHere's what you need to get rid of that cough.\nHome remedies for minor coughing\nIf your dog’s cough is minor and infrequent, you can try treating them at home. One of the most important things to do is keep your dog well-hydrated. Always have fresh water available, and if your dog needs encouragement to drink, try giving them some low-sodium chicken broth, either alone or flavoring the water.\nIt is helpful to place a humidifier in the areas where they spend their time. Also, make sure they get enough rest, which is helpful for all illnesses. Avoid exposure to allergens or irritants like smoke or strong fragrances. With your vet’s approval, you can give your dog small amounts of honey, which is enormously soothing for an irritated throat.\nDog coughing prevention tips\nYour dog should always be hydrated, even when they’re not ill. Encourage your dog to drink slowly and provide fresh, clean water. This can help reduce irritation and coughing risks. Special water bowls designed for slow drinking can be helpful for dogs who gulp water too quickly.\nRegular veterinary check-ups can identify and manage underlying conditions before they worsen. It’s much better to treat issues early to preserve their long-term health. Vaccinations can prevent some respiratory illnesses. Likewise, parasite prevention can keep lungworms and heartworms away. Your veterinarian will also listen carefully to your dog’s heart and lungs, even at preventative visits, to spot something like a murmur early on, which can be lifesaving.\nMinimize exposure to irritants like dust, pollen, and household chemicals. If your dog is prone to allergies, consider using air purifiers and hypoallergenic bedding. Allergy testing is available by skin or blood test, and the results can be very helpful.\nFeeding them a healthy diet and making sure they maintain an appropriate weight can reduce strain on your dog’s respiratory and cardiovascular systems — lowering the risk of conditions such as tracheal collapse and congestive heart failure. Portion control or a special low-calorie diet can help your dog lose weight. Speak to your vet to determine an appropriate diet.\nReferences\nDe, Helio. “Why Is This Patient Coughing?

  "page_content": "From champagne to parties to resolution list writing, New Year’s Eve can be lots of fun for humans. But when it comes to those gorgeous fireworks displays popping up around the country (or the amateur ones in our most adventurous neighbor’s backyard), our four-legged family members are a little less thrilled. Fireworks are a huge source of stress for dogs — and they can be a serious health hazard, too.\nYour pup deserves a joyful start to 2025, so we talked to Dr. Gabrielle Fadl, veterinarian and director of primary care atBond Vetin New York City, about the dangers of fireworks to dogs and how to keep your dog safe this holiday.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhy are dogs scared of fireworks?\nThe short answer:Loud noises can be frighteningto many dogsandcats. The booming blasts of fireworks are unpredictable and sudden, and fireworks are likely louder than most noises your pet is used to hearing. If you have a dog who’sfreaked out by thunderstorms,they will likely be scared of fireworks, too.\n“Similar to thunderstorms, fireworks causing loud, unpredictable noises can be interpreted as a threat to dogs, causing them to hide,show signs of anxiety(panting, trembling, pacing, whining), or run,” Dr. Fadl says.\nWith their bright lights and loud noises, fireworks can also createsensory overloadin animals, resulting in a panicked fight-or-flight response. Although there is no real threat, your pet doesn’t know that, and they may experience an adrenaline rush that results in rising blood pressure and a faster heart rate. This sense of danger causes some pets to attempt to escape or even react with aggression toward other animals and humans in the home.\nHow are fireworks dangerous to dogs?\nFireworks come with many risks for dogs, so it’s best to keep your pets safely inside during any New Year’s celebrations. In addition to a sense of fear and stress, dogs who are outside unattended during fireworks displays run the risk of becoming burned, injured, or even ingesting lit or used fireworks.\nFear and anxiety can lead your dog to make a run for it. “If dogs are not properly restrained, dogs can get loose and run away in an attempt to find safety,” Dr. Fadl says. “As a result, dogs can get lost or injured while attempting to climb or dig to escape these sounds.”\nEven if your dog happens to be chill about fireworks, allowing them outside while you’re lighting sparklers can be dangerous. Dogs may not realize the danger of lit fireworks and get too close, which can result in burns to the face or even the inside of the mouth if they attempt to ingest a lit firework.\n“The same precautions that you would take when using fireworks around young children should also be taken with your pets,” Dr. Fadl adds. “That means making sure fireworks are not being set off with pets nearby and able to get near hazardous sparks, flames, or strong smoke or odors.”\nHealth issues related to ingesting fireworks\nFireworks don’t even have to be lit to cause injury to your pet. When roaming the yard after a firework display, dogs may ingest debris or pieces of used fireworks, which contain dangerous chemicals, such as heavy metals, sulfur, and coloring agents. Eating fireworks can cause serious health issues for dogs, such asgastrointestinal distressor even muscle and nerve dysfunction, which can result in permanent damage.\nYou probably don’t need to worry about cats ingesting fireworks because they tend to be more discriminating eaters and likely won’t attempt to eat a used firework. But you should always clean up all used fireworks and debris in your yard before allowing your pets outside again.\nTips for comforting your pup when the storm is too loud for your pup’s comfort.\nTips for keeping your dog calm and safe during fireworks displays\nIf you know that your dog is scared of loud noises, make sure to have a plan for soothing your pet during New Year celebrations and know how to calm a dog during fireworks. Start by keeping your dog away from any nearby firework displays and safely cozied up in the house. If you live in a cold climate, your pet should be safely inside anyway, but make sure you have them in a place in the house where they feel safe when they hear loud noises.\nWell before New Year’s Eve comes around, yourpet should be microchippedand have an ID tag on their collar featuring your current contact information. No one expects their dog to run away, but fireworks can make your pet’s behavior unpredictable, so it’s best to take precautions. Ensuring your dog has proper identification can improve the chances that they will be returned to you if they do become lost.\nOne of the best ways to calm your dog during fireworks is to make a space in your home for them to feel safe and comfortable. Choose a space with no windows, like the inside of a large closet or a bathroom, and create a cozy cave where your dog can hide from the noise and lights of the fireworks. You can even use a crate if your dog already feels safe there. Give your pup some of their favorite toys and treats so they feel at home and (hopefully) more relaxed.\n“If you can, try to engage your dog in a playful or fun activity, such as a training or play session,beforethe noises are expected to begin,” Dr. Fadl suggests. “Using positive reinforcement, like rewarding calm behaviors with treats or affection, can be helpful in a sound-phobic dog.”\nSoft, soothing noises can be an antidote to the loud bangs of fireworks. Try leaving some kind of white noise — like the TV or radio — on to help cover the sounds of any firework displays and give your dog something else to focus on. You can even find soothing white noise playlists, including somespecifically designed for dogs,on YouTube and Spotify.\nYour pup might want company; leaving your pet alone during fireworks can sometimes make them even more stressed. If you can, stay home with your dog to help them feel safer and comfort them if they show signs of stress or fear. Pet your pup with long, slow strokes along the length of their body and avoid any behaviors that seem frantic. Try to keep your voice and your movements calm and reassuring to show your dog that they’re safe with you.\nThere’s nothing to fear but fear itself — and a dog who won’t stop shaking when it thunders.\nIf your pet’s anxiety is especially severe and none of the above solutions seem to help, talk to your veterinarian about other treatment options. Your dog may benefit from anti-anxiety medication, which your vet can prescribe, and you may also want to ask about over-the-counter options, like dog-calming treats, anxiety vests likeThundershirts, or CBD products. Never, ever give your dogover-the-counter medicationwithout consulting a vet, and always be sure theCBD productsyou use are completely free of THC and approved for pets.\n“Some dogs are so severely impacted by noises that anxiolytic or sedating medication may be needed to help keep them calm and prevent them from harming themselves,” Dr. Fadl says. “There are many safe options, as well as FDA-approved medication for dogs with noise aversion.

But you can stop them from doing it if it bothers you. Here’s how.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents.

Rachel Rodgers, a clinical animal behaviorist and the founder ofNose to Trail, explains: “It’s not ‘abnormal’ in the sense of it being detrimental to a dog’s health and potentially dangerous, but it is not the most common of behaviors. Some dogs will do it, others won’t.” Rodgers, who has two dogs, finds that one licks her feet, while the other one has no interest at all.\nThe sentiment is nice, but...\n6 common reasons why your dog licks your legs\nThe number one reason why your dog licks your legs? They love you. Your dog is interested in every part of you, and licking is one way that they’re communicating this affection. (They don’t have words, so we have to listen to the other ways they express themselves.) “Any kind of licking by a dog could be a sign of affection, similar to how they may interact with other dogs,” says Rodgers. However, context is important.\nDogs love attention, and licking is one way that they get it, particularly if you put up a fuss, scream, or laugh when they lick you. That positive reinforcement means that they will continue to lick your legs, as long as it gets your attention.\nSweat is salty, and dogs love the taste of salt. In particular, if you’ve just woken up or worked out, your dog might be licking your legs to get that sweet sweat taste. “Some dogs just enjoy the taste of your sweat,” says Rodgers. And that’s nothing to worry about at all.\nIf you’ve put on lotion, your dog might be licking you because the taste is interesting. Alternatively, they might be licking you to try and get rid of the weird, foreign smell on your body — they want you to smell more like a familiar member of their pack again.\nIn a similar vein, your dog might actually be grooming you. Rodgers says this isn’t common, because dogs don’t groom as thoroughly as cats do. “At the end of the day, our dogs know that we aren’t dogs too,” says Rodgers. “However, they can learn from other animals to do this and have seen their mother licking siblings when they were young.”\nLicking behaviors are comforting to dogs, and they might be licking your legs as a way to self-soothe or comfort themselves. Says Rodgers, “Dogs can do this as an appeasing behavior, something they do when they’re a little worried.” This is particularly true if they’ve done something wrong. Still, if it bothers you, it’s OK to try to get them to stop (see below), no matter how much they like it.\nThat’s cute... sort of?\nWhen to be concerned about licking\nYou shouldn’t worry too much about your dog’s licking behaviors. But if it seems excessive or compulsive, this might be a sign of a deeper issue. If it seems like a new behavior that’s unusual for them, you should contact your vet.\n“It is also important to consider the length of time a dog spends licking your legs,” Rodgers says. “If this is something they are doing for considerable periods of time, several times a day, every day — then we want to start looking at why they are doing this, as it could be they are feeling a bit anxious or stressed.”\nHow to train your dog to stop licking your legs\nIf your dog licks your legs too much and you want to stop them, don’t encourage the behavior. Walk away and don’t positively reinforce the licking through laughter or playing with them. Rodgers says that all behavior is made up of the ABCs: “A” for antecedent (what happens before), “B” for the behavior, and “C” for consequence. “The intervention point needs to be at point A. To break this habit, change the cycle of what happens before.” She also recommends having an enrichment device you’re ready to give them, like a lick mat or Kong smothered in something tastier than your sweat.\nBottom line\nThere are tons of reasons why your dog might love to lick your legs. Maybe they’re expressing love and affection, maybe they want attention, maybe they’re actually grooming you. Regardless, you don’t really need to worry about the behavior unless it seems excessive to you.\nFAQs\nYou may find that your dog seems to lick your legs more when it’s first thing in the morning. This could simply be because you’re a little sweaty from sleeping and they like the taste.\nGenerally, licking isn’t anything to worry about. But if your dog is doing it excessively or much more than usual, this could be a sign of gastrointestinal issues. When in doubt, contact your vet. “It is often seen more as an emotional response to things rather than a health problem in itself,” says Rodgers, reassuringly.\nOne reason why a dog might lick you when you get out of the shower is because you smell weird to them. They’re trying to get the foreign scents of shower gels and other products off you. You might also just smell exciting and tasty to them.\nYour dog licks you so much because they love you, and it feels good to them. They’re being affectionate and playful, and they don’t realize it can get a little gross for you. Adds Rodgers: “We have to remember dogs don’t have hands. They don’t explore the world with their paws. They often use their mouths instead, particularly puppies. Sometimes this becomes a habit they start from an early age.”",

  "page_content": "At some point, most of us wonder what’s going on in our dogs’ heads. Whether triggered by displays of surprising intelligence or boneheadedness, questions about dogs’ perception of themselves and the world around them have intrigued pet parents, behaviorists, psychologists, and philosophers. We often seek to understand if dogs experience life in the same way we do, but it is only recently that testing of dogs’ awareness has acknowledged that they interact with the world in their own way.\nDogs show many forms of self-awareness under numerous testing conditions.\nDogs show many forms of self-awareness under numerous testing conditions.\nDogs form significant attachment bonds with their parents.

Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nAre dogs self-aware?\nFor many years, researchers assumed that dogs were not self-aware because they didn’t seem to recognize their image in the mirror as their own. More recent research has shown that dogs are more aware of themselves than previously thought.\nSelf-awareness has many manifestations. Some of the more philosophical ones can’t easily be tested. In humans, part of self-awareness involves considering our behavior and evaluating if we are upholding our standards and values. This seems like a lot for a dog, so the dog version of this might be: does a dog worry if they’re a good dog? That idea is very hard to test.\nAnother version of self-awareness is self-recognition. Do dogs maintain a mental representation of their body and the space it occupies? That may be a bit easier to find out.\nTests have consistently shown that dogs are aware of the physical space they occupy. This means both that they recognize thesize of their bodyand that they realize that their body affects the world around them.\nAcross numerous tests, dogs consistently show that they are aware of whether they can fit through an opening and will take a longer path to a reward if they feel they can’t fit. This type of body awareness is a key component of self-recognition and shows that dogs can likely form an image of themselves in their mind.\nAnother test wanted to find out if dogs realized that their body could be an obstacle. Dogs were trained to bring an object to their parents on command. This object was then either attached to a mat that the dog would stand on while picking the object up or to the solid ground beneath the mat. Dogs showed awareness that their body was preventing them from retrieving the object when it was attached to the mat and moved so that they weren’t standing on the mat. This movement occurred less frequently when the object was attached to the ground. This shows that dogs are aware of how their body impacts things around them.\nDogs seem to be aware that a certain smell belongs to them and generally show less interest in exploring their own scent. This makes sense when you consider that dogs use scent information to mark territory. Dogs recognize their own scent markings and don’t pay much attention to them, instead focusing on foreign scents that can tell them about who else has been in their area.\nDogs do seem to have some awareness of their physical capabilities. They may sometimes test these boundaries and fail, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they don’t consider them. Most pet parents have seen a demonstration of this: given time to think about it, dogs will consider if they can make a jump before attempting it.\nDo dogs know their reflection? Classic research says they do not, but it’s possible the testing methodology is flawed (more on this later). Despite not seeming to acknowledge that they are thedog in the mirror, dogs are aware of how reflections in mirrors work. Dogs have used mirrors to monitor where an object is hidden, then found the object more quickly than dogs that were not able to watch where it was placed.\nDogs are inherently social animals and have a distinct awareness of other dogs, animals, and people. They show the ability to react to both human and animal social cues, and they can learn behaviors and actions from their parents and playmates.\nDo dogs understand pet-parent relationships?\nSometimes it can feel like your dog just uses you as a food delivery service, and it wouldn’t matter what human was around as long as they fill the bowl up on time. Despite our occasional misgivings about their behavior, dogs do seem to form an emotional attachment to the people most familiar to them.\nDogs form significant attachment to their parents, showing changes in behavior during separation, participating in greeting rituals during reunions, and seeking the presence of a familiar person during times of stress. Theattachment stylesseen between a dog and their favorite person mirror those between a young child and their parent.\nDogs are able to pick up on people’s emotional states. In tests, dogs can recognize sounds of crying and distress from humans they are separated from and show more urgency in reaching them when they seem upset. In addition, dogs show more empathy for people in distress if they are familiar with them. This means your dog actually does care more about youthan a stranger.\nSocial hierarchy is important to dogs, and they recognize the importance ofsocial structuresin relation to both other dogs and people. Dogs take cues from familiar humans andwatch them for instructions. They can complete tasks after someone shows them how to do them and will even imitate the way a task is accomplished, even if it is done in a purposefully inefficient way. This type of imitation is seen in closely bonded people, but not in many other animal species like great apes.\nSome dogs get unreasonably anxious when separated from people they are closely bonded to.Separation anxietycan lead to increasing stress, self-harm, and destructive behavior. Separation anxiety is a complex topic, but dogs seem to do best when they are confidenttheir parentswill return and can rely on them to behave predictably.\nHow to test a dog’s awareness: The mirror test\nThe mirror self-recognition (MSR) test was developed in the 1970s to determine if animals realized that the reflection in the mirror was their own. In the most common version of the test, a mark is placed on a body part while the animal is unaware. The animal is then observed to see if they touch the area more before and after a mirror is introduced to their enclosure. While some species like the great apes, dolphins, and orcas have passed the test, most other species fail to show that they recognize that they see themselves in the mirror.\nSo, why don’t dogs recognize themselves in the mirror? After all, it seems obvious to many pet parents that their dogs are aware that the dog in the reflection is not another dog (otherwise we’d have a lot of broken mirrors around). It’s possible that the mirror test is too human-centric. People generally rely on vision as our primary way of exploring and guiding our interactions with the environment. Dogs prioritize scent over vision, so a mirror test using changes in their scent was developed.\nDogs participating in the “olfactory mirror” test spent more time investigating their altered scent than their unaltered scent or the altering agent alone. The validity and relevance of this experiment is still being debated, but it shows further evidence that dogs are self-aware.\nGauging animal intelligence and cognition is a challenging endeavor, and tests like the olfactory mirror show that researchers need to find approaches that test what is important to the animal being tested, not to humans. When tested, dogs seem to be self-aware in many ways, and the areas where they fail may be due to flaws with the testing method rather than their intelligence. After all, dog scientists would probably think most humans were pretty dumb if they tested our ability to track scents or know when an earthquake is coming.\nResearch indicates yes, so why is your large pup still laying on top of you?\nReferences\nArden, Rosalind, et al. “A Review of Cognitive Abilities in Dogs, 1911 through 2016.”Current Directions in Psychological Science, vol. 25, no. 5, Oct. 2016, pp. 307–312,https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721416667718.\nArden, Rosalind, et al. “A Review of Cognitive Abilities in Dogs, 1911 through 2016.”Current Directions in Psychological Science, vol. 25, no. 5, Oct. 2016, pp. 307–312,https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721416667718.\nBastos, Amalia P.

  "page_content": "Making ourselves understood is hard enough with other humans. Sometimes, there’s so much confusion between people, itseemswe are dealing with members of another species. Even though dogs and people sometimes seem so compatible — it’s amazing we’renotthe same species — it’s inevitable that we misunderstand each other from time to time.\nSome dogs are more sensitive and responsive to body language, but all dogs are influenced by our behavior — and sometimes we move in a way that they can misinterpret. Knowing the behavior that confuses our dogs allows us to communicate more effectively. When you and your pup understand each other better, you will have a stronger relationship.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHere are seven ways people confuse dogs without realizing it.\n1. Facing forward and leaning toward a dog when greeting them\nWhen people greet each other, it’s polite to face one another and lean toward the other person while making eye contact. In canine society, such behavior — rather than representing good manners — is rude and threatening. Greeting dogs, especially fearful ones, in this manner, is intimidating or even terrifying.\nIt’s easier to make friends with a new dog by making agood first impression. That means you should turn a bit to the side, leaning slightly away from the dog and getting low by squatting if it’s safe to do so. Greeting in an intimidating, rather than a welcoming, way confuses dogs into thinking you are to be feared, even when you are trying to be friendly.\n2. Pushing a dog away with your hands when they jump up on you\nIt’s natural to use your hands to push a dog down whenthey jump up on you. You are probably trying to stop the behavior by letting the pup know that it’s not acceptable. But in response, dogs often jump up even more enthusiastically, probably causing you to push them again. This just gets the dog more revved up and makes both parties even more confused.\nThe person is attempting to say, “Cut it out; get off of me,” but something is lost in translation. And by “something,” I actually mean “everything” because to dogs, pushing or batting at them is a play signal. So, regardless of what the person means, the message the dog receives is: “Let’s play!”\nNaturally, the dog continues to leap up joyfully rather than leaving the person alone. Sadly, this confusion can lead to anger and frustration for both.Why won’t this dog calm down? the person wonders, while the and dog is possibly thinking something along the lines of,Why do people act like they want to play and then get mad when you do?\nIf your dog jumps on you when they greet you, consider what you’d ratherhave them do. When they sit as they greet you, you want them to associate that behavior with good things. So, if they sit, give them a treat.\nIf they jump or act out of control, walk away — preferably, leave the room. Wait 30 seconds, then come back into the room to try again. Repeat this three to five more times. When you do this, your dog learns that when they jump, you disappear, which is the opposite of what they want. It takes repetition to achieve this, but many dogs will get the hang of it after the second try.\n3. Holding your breath\nPeople often react to feeling tense or stressed by holding their breath. This can happen when the situation involves our dogs, such as seeing anoff-leash dogcharging at us on a walk or something totally unrelated. Yesterday, I held my breath when I thought I had forgotten to pay an important bill; when I realized I had paid it, I finally exhaled. That kind of tension is contagious to our pups.\nWhen they notice us holding our breath, they may feel tense, too, but without knowing why. This can be confusing to them. Whether a tense situation has anything to do with your dog or not, remember to breathe. If something anxiety-provokinghappens on a walk, inthe car, or at home, try to remember to breathe so you don’t cause unnecessary angst in your dog.\nWhen you want your dog to stay calm, even if you’re not, it helps to breathe. That’s easiest to do if you’re talking. It doesn’t matter what you say, because if you are talking, you are not holding your breath.\n4. Using your voice in a way that contradicts your message to your dog\nDogs can certainly learn the cues “come” and “stay” and respond appropriately, but the words alone are only part of the information we give them. Thewaywe say italso helps them understand what we are asking them to do. It’s confusing when what we are asking them to do and the tone of our voice are at odds with one another.\nIf we say, “Come!” like a drill sergeant in a demanding, angry tone of voice, that confuses our dog. It’s as if our word means, “I want you to come over to me,” but the threatening tone of our voice says, “Stay the hell away!”\nWhen asking a dog to do anything that requires them to control themselves and be calm, a soothing, slow, drawn-out delivery of the cue with a descending pitch is most helpful. Imagine saying, “Staaay” the way a rider says, “Whoaaaa” to their horse to get the horse to stop. If we instead say, “Stay” in a highly energetic way, we confuse our dogs. That excitement inspires them to get excited, too, rather than to settle into staying.\nConversely, when asking a dog to do something that requires energetic action, a high-pitched, rapidly repeated sound is most effective. So, saying, “Come!” and following it with clapping, smooching, or with other sounds such as “pup, pup, pup” or “whoop, whoop, whoop” will be most effective.\nImagine saying, “Come!” and adding other sounds in much the same way a rider says, “Giddyup!” to their horse to tell the horse to get moving. To that end, if we want our dogs to joyfully run to us as fast as their legs can carry them, a happy, upbeat tone of voice is best for communicating that message.\n5. Turning your back and walking away from a dog doing a stay\nWhen we tell our dog, “Stay,” we want them to do exactly that — remain in the same spot until we let them know they are free to go. Even dogs who have learned to do this reasonably well can become confused if we turn and walk away from them after giving them the cue to stay. That’s because dogs have a natural tendency to follow us when we walk away. So, our cue is telling them “Stay,” but our body is communicating a different message: “Let’s go!”\nAn old training adage is that dogs are interested in going in the same direction as a person’s nose and their toes. You can move away from your dog without causing them to break their stay by backing away from them. Dogs can definitely be taught to hold their stay when we increase our distance from them. But it’s easier for them if we start that training by backing away, rather than by turning and walking away.\nOnce they learn you will return after backing away, it’s easier to teach them to stay there and wait for you to return, even if you turn and walk away. (This also takes a lot of practice and many repetitions.)\n6. Trying to play without giving a play signal\nSuddenly running at a dog or starting to wrestle with them can lead to a misunderstanding. They may perceive your actions as an attack because they don’t understand the playful intentions of your actions. In such a situation, it’s natural for them to act defensively.\nIf it's a dog you know well, however, and have played with many times, they'll likely to understand what you are doing. Your behavior has a history of being associated with play and is clearly intended to be in good fun. If it's a dog you don’t know well or have never met, they can get confused if you try to play without using a signal.\nThis is much like the difference between a favorite relative playfully coming up to a child and saying, “I’m going to get you!” and a stranger doing the same thing. The confusion is real for both dogs and people in situations with strangers.\nIf you want to start playing with a dog, you need tolet them knowthat the games are about to begin. You can do this by waving a toy near them, running away so they can chase you, or doing a modified play bow. To do the play bow, abruptly bend your knees deeply, and spread your arms out to the side.\n7. Engaging with a dog to try to get them to leave you alone\nSometimes, no matter how much we love dogs, we need them to let us do what we need to do in peace. Maybe we need our dog to give us some space when replacing our phone’s screen protector, or maybe we are visiting someone whose dog is just a little pushy for our taste. Either way, many dogs don’t easily get the message to back off.\nTrying to get a dog to understand that you want them to leave you alone can be hard. This is especially true if they are used to having your undivided attention, or they’re a particularly persistent dog. Any verbal instruction or physical contact can leave them even more intent on hanging out with you or sitting on your foot and generally being close to you. Many dogs are confused by people’s efforts to be left alone. I can practically hear them thinking,But being together, right next to each other, or even on top of each other is what we do!\nLuckily, there is a way to clear up the confusion and communicate to a dog that you are not interested in engaging with them. The behavior is called a “look away,” and it’s a social signal that means (roughly translated):I’m not available for social interaction right now. It carries no emotion or judgment. In other words, it’s not rude, bossy, passive aggressive, or anything bad at all. It functions as a simple statement.\nTo do a look away, turn your face away from the dog with your chin up. (It’s very important that your chin is up because that’s a very informative part of the signal.) If the dog comes to the side you are now facing, do another look away in the other direction and repeat as needed.\nSome dogs get the message on the first try, and others need you to look away a few times to get the message. Dogs use this signal with other dogs, which is probably why they understand it so well and typically respond by walking away and finding something else to do.\nThe takeaway\nDogs and people have such a beautiful relationship with so much mutual understanding and love, so it’s not always obvious when we have a miscommunication. But they do happen. Understanding how we confuse our dogs canonly make us closer, and who doesn’t want that?",

But that doesn’t make it less awkward.\nDog humpingcan make everyone feel weird. It’s just so awkward, especially when your dog has chosen to mount the pup of the most judgy person at the park. Do you step in and intervene? Do you let the dogs work it out themselves while you try not to stare? Read on to learn about some strategies to navigate these cringe-worthy moments.\nTake these steps to respond to the problem.\nWhy do dogs hump?\nHumping is a normal dog behavior that occurs in a variety of contexts between dogs. Technically referred to as mounting, it tends to happen when a dog’s arousal, or excitement level, is very high. The biological instinct to hump is to reproduce, but it can occur in many other contexts, too. Here are some of those motivations.\nA dog’s basic instinct to mount another dog is typically tied to a hormone-fueled drive to reproduce. Intact female dogs go into heat, during which time they are receptive to mating, and intact male dogs can sense this. This triggers a very strong instinct to mate, and thus mounting ensues. Dogs who are spayed and neutered have a muted sex drive, but some may still become aroused and attempt to mount. Females will not go into heat if they are spayed.\nMounting can be a normalpart of playbetween dogs, too. When they play, dogs may act out instinctive, but out-of-context behaviors, including play fighting, hunting, and even mounting. In this setting, mounting is usually brief, and dogs should not be showing signs of distress.\nSometimes dogs use mounting as a way to keep order or guide another dog’s actions within theirsocial group. They may do this to stop another dog from moving in a specific direction or to keep a dog still.\nHumping can also be a displacement behavior, one performed out of context as an outlet for pent-up energy. This may occur when dogs are in an unfamiliar environment and feel unsure of what to do, or because theyfeel especially fearfulor excited.\nSome dogs also mount other dogs or even inanimate objects due to underlying anxiety. This is also a displacement behavior.\nA dog may also hump due to a medical problem. Most commonly, this isrelated to painor discomfort in their urinary tract, genital area, or around their anus.\nCommon myths about why dogs hump\nThere are some myths that only intact male dogs hump and that neutering will completely solve this problem. The truth is that neutering can help, especially when it is done before dogs reach sexual maturity. However, both male and female dogs can engage in mounting behavior, even if they arespayed and neutered.\nAnother common misconception is that mounting is always related to dominance and that more dominant dogs will always mount more submissive dogs. This ignores the many nuanced reasons why dogs mount one another, in addition to people and/or inanimate objects, which can make it much harder to find targeted solutions.\nThis simple dog training skill could save your dog’s life.\nHere’s how to deal with a dog who’s humping other dogs\nMany times, mounting upsets people more than it upsets dogs, so try not to anthropomorphize too much if you see your pup engaging in behaviors that might get a human arrested.\nThe behavior in play may be borrowed from other contexts — such as fighting, hunting, and mating. So determining whether or not a behavior is appropriate play, awkward and inappropriate attempts to play, or something else altogether is not always completely straightforward. Here are some guidelines to determine when to intervene.\nIt’s only play ifeveryoneinvolved is having fun. That means you should intervene and stop the behavior if you seebody languagethat suggests one of the dogs is trying to avoid the interaction orclearly not having a good time, or if you are concerned one of the dogs may get injured.\nInterrupting a humping dog is easier said than done. If your dog won’tcome when calledor back off when told to “leave it,” you may have to physically lead them away. In these cases, redirect your pup to another activity such as a toy or other dogs to play with.\nMounting can be a sign that your pup is overstimulated, whether from excitement, fear, or uncertainty. If your pup can’t find a constructive outlet for those feelings, the best thing for them may be to leave the situation andallow them to calm down. Your dog may just get too excited at thedog parkand is much calmer when only one or two other dogs are around.\nHow to train your dog to stop humping\nThe most effective strategies to stop humping are targeted at the underlying cause of the behavior. Be sure to pay close attention to the situations that seem to set your pup off, and try to understand the pattern. Here are some strategies to try.\nThe first step is to understand why your dog is humping. Does this seem to be happening at certain times, in certain places, and/or with certain dogs? Learn the patterns, so you can be on the lookout for triggers and work to avoid them and/or redirect your pup in those situations.\nIf you catch your dog in the act, calmly redirect them towards a more acceptable activity. This can be as simple as asking your dog to perform a trained cue on command or giving them a toy to play with instead.\nIf you know what is triggering your pup, try to help them find better outlets for that energy. For example, if your dog is getting overstimulated at the dog park, maybe they need more exercise andgeneral enrichmentbefore heading out there. Or maybe they need to stick to smaller playgroups and avoid the dog park altogether. If your dog seems nervous or unsure of how to interact in certain settings,work on teaching them cuesto show them what kinds of behaviors you want them to do instead — such as cues to sit, lay down, or go to their mat.\nPunishment is not a productive way to deter humping, because it may increase your dog’s frustration and anxiety. Additionally, if you draw more attention to the behavior by making a big deal out of it, you may unintentionally reinforce the behavior. Negative attention is still attention, and dogs may associate the behavior with increased attention from you.\nWhat to do when dog humping becomes a problem\nIf your dog’s humping behavior is excessive and/or interfering with their normal activities, it is important to work on figuring out the underlying cause and finding effective solutions. Be sure to see your vet to rule out medical causes, and discuss spaying or neutering if your pup is intact.\nIf your vet agrees that this is a behavioral problem and you have not had success using the training techniques listed here, it may be time to seek professional help from a behaviorist.Working with a certified behavioristcan help you hone in on your dog’s underlying motivations and find solutions for you and your pup.\nDoes spaying and neutering stop humping behavior?\nNot necessarily, but it can help. Dogs who are intact have an added reason to hump: Their sex drive is much higher as a result of hormonal influences, and they are more likely to hump in an attempt to actually mate. Spaying and neutering will decrease this impulse to hump, because their sex drive will be dramatically reduced. However, spayed and neutered dogs might still hump for many other reasons that are not impacted by spaying and neutering.\nBottom line\nMounting is a normal canine behavior in many contexts.\nMounting is a normal canine behavior in many contexts.\nIt is important to note the triggers that set your dog’s humping behavior into overdrive.\nIt is important to note the triggers that set your dog’s humping behavior into overdrive.\nIn cases where your dog’s humping becomes excessive or puts other dogs on the defensive, you’ll want to intervene.\nIn cases where your dog’s humping becomes excessive or puts other dogs on the defensive, you’ll want to intervene.\nSeek help if you can’t determine their exact triggers or need support in finding solutions that work for your pup.\nSeek help if you can’t determine their exact triggers or need support in finding solutions that work for your pup.\nFAQs\nIn most cases, humping is a neutral behavior that is neither good nor bad. It is a normal behavior that dogs engage in regularly. However, if your dog seems to do this excessively, or if they are getting into conflicts with other dogs as a result of this behavior, it may have a negative impact on them.\nSometimes dogs hump when they are happy or excited. Other times, it can be a sign of anxiety or overstimulation.\nThere is no specific age when humping behavior stops, and some dogs do it for their whole lives. Adolescent dogs who have recently reached sexual maturity are more likely to hump, but it can happen at any age.\nHumping can sometimes be a sign of aggression or dominance, but there are many other possible reasons for this behavior, too. It is important to look at what else is going on during these interactions, and how the dogs are reacting, to know what is motivating the behavior.\nReferences\nBergman, Laurie. “Canine mounting: an overview.”Clinician’s Brief, January 2012, pp. 61-63.\nBergman, Laurie. “Canine mounting: an overview.”Clinician’s Brief, January 2012, pp. 61-63.\nDidehban, Negar, et al. “Problematic behaviors in companion dogs: A survey of their prevalence and associated factors.”Journal of Veterinary Behavior, vol. 39, September-October 2020, pp. 6-13.\nDidehban, Negar, et al. “Problematic behaviors in companion dogs: A survey of their prevalence and associated factors.”Journal of Veterinary Behavior, vol. 39, September-October 2020, pp. 6-13.\nNorris, Breanna. “Why does my dog hump?”Cattle Dog Publishing,26 June 2023.\nNorris, Breanna. “Why does my dog hump?”Cattle Dog Publishing,26 June 2023.",

    "title": "Does Putting Your Pet in “Air Jail” Actually Work?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/pet-behavior/air-jail"
  },
  "page_content": "Have you ever picked up your dog or cat and held them in the air to stop them from doing something you don’t want them to do?  If so, you may have put them in “air jail” without knowing it. “Air jail” is a cute term for something that many pet parents will recognize: just grabbing your pet and holding them.\nWe tend to do it more often when we get worried about our pets’ behavior, like when they’re interacting with another animal and don’t seem happy. As you can see from thisReddit thread, there is no size limit for pets in air jail. While it seems harmless, there may be some issues with resorting to air jail.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nSo, does air jailwork?\nAs many pet owners know, if you grab your pet while they’re doing something naughty like humping your leg or chewing the sofa, they do kinda freeze and stop what they’re doing.Certified Dog Behavior ConsultantKellie Stevens says that whether or not it “works” depends on what your definition of “working” is. “Can it stop or prevent a dog from doing something in the moment? Yes. Does it teach them a different behavior to do instead? No. Can it cause worse issues in the long run? Big yes,” Stevens warns.\nWhat are some of the issues with air jail?\nMost of all, Stevens says, air jail doesn’t actually teach your pet anything other than “this behavior leads to being picked up.” Your pet may even like being picked up, which hardly discourages them from the behavior. “Most people want the behavior to stop for the long run, and air jail is really just a momentary pause,” she adds. She goes on to add that, depending on the situation, a dog could even find it punishing. “They associate you picking them up with the fun ending, which can lead to them avoiding you or refusing to come back when called next time, or being picked up in other situations, including emergencies,” Stevens says.This can even lead to your pet becoming defensive over time. “This behavior could look like hiding, growling, snapping or even biting when you attempt to pick them up,” Stevens says. “If you're using ‘air jail’ when a dog is reacting to something they're afraid of, reaching out to pick them up could also lead to a redirected bite while they're in an overstimulated headspace.”\nAre there any more serious problems that can be caused by air jail?\nOverall, air jail doesn’t tend to hurt your dog. They may even like to be picked up generally, so it might seem to you like a reassuring or even enjoyable action. However, per Stevens, there are many potential serious concerns caused by relying on air jail. “One issue most people aren’t aware of when picking their dogs up during a situation like an off-leash dog running over is that picking the dog up can actually just raise the target, so now you have a dog jumping up on you to try to get to the dog in your hands,” she says. “If that turns into a fight, now the fight is literally in yourarms and face. It can be dangerous.”\nWe tend to pick up very small dogs more often, which Stevens says can lead to them feeling defensive about being handled or picked up. By taking away their agency and freedom of choice, it can make them feel embarrassed, too: “By picking them up in any situation that makes us uncomfortable or embarrassed. Rather than teaching a behavior we’d rather see, we end up teaching them that being picked up sucks and to avoid it by any means, even using their teeth.”\nAre there any situations where you should pick your pet up?\nWhile air jail isn’t the best thing to fall back on, Stevens says that there are some situations where there is literally no choice but to pick up your dog: “If you’re in an emergency situation, and you can pick your dog up to protect them, that's understandable, and something that doesn’t happen often.” However, especially when it comes to dog-dog interactions, you need to make sure it’s a true emergency, and that you aren’t just being fearful or reactive. The more twitchy you are, the more your dog will pick up on it.\nBut what about cats?\nPeople primarily think about dogs when it comes to “air jail,” but there are some cat owners who will choose this method to control their behavior. Dogs and cats have very different personalities overall, and cats tend to be more resistant to being held at all.\nAccordingto experts, it’s not a great idea–least of all because you don’t want to get scratched. One vet toldNewsweek:“Most cats don’t like it. All cats are individuals, and there may be the occasional goofy kitten who tolerates or even likes being held up in the air; however, while it may seem harmless to us, this is not a safe or comfortable position for most cats.” She went on to say that it could even harm your bond with your cat.\nWhat are some alternatives to air jail?\nIf you tend to fall back on air jail for your pets in the moment, you might need to revisit your training regimen overall. Stevens says that the best thing to do is teach your pet to walk away from scary or exciting things on cue. “This is a great alternative that doesn’t involve having to touch them, and it gets them space from that thing so their brains can cool off and return to thinking/learning state rather than a reacting/surviving state,” she says.\nTaking it one step further, Stevens adds that “you can play pattern games with them to create predictability in an unpredictable situation if they’re reacting to something that makes them anxious. You can teach them more appropriate social behavior if it’s a situation like dog-dog greetings or interactions.”\nIf you really need to pick your dog up for some reason, says Stevens, you can teach them in advance how to opt into behavior on cue and practice in the situations that you tend to find yourself picking your dog up. All pets are different, but while your dog might seem to tolerate air jail, overall it’s not the most effective way to stop them from engaging in unwanted behaviors.\nReferences\nVolpe, Maria Azzurra. “Cat Owner Claps Back at Criticism of How He Holds Orange Boy: “Air Jail.””Newsweek, 14 Oct. 2024,www.newsweek.com/cat-owner-claps-back-criticism-how-he-holds-orange-boy-air-jail-1968489.

The bad news is that you’re not telepathic, no matter how much you and your pup are on the same wavelength.\nUnderstanding your dog’s body language and paying close attention to the subtle clues they send is crucial to deepening your bond.

And just like humans, the general expressions that we associate with certain feelings are not always cut and dry, but rather, need to be interpreted with the rest of their body language and in the context of the situation. I mean, how many times have you put on a fake smile when you’re cringing inside and your body is clearly tense? Keep in mind that one expression alone does not signify the whole mood, and sometimes there are overlaps between certain features. This includes:\nFor many dogs, a happy and relaxed expression will include a relaxed brow without any wrinkles or furrows, along with slow blinks or eyes that are partially closed or squinting. Some dogs may also have a relaxed,open mouth. Happy dogs may also pant depending on their level of activity or warmth, and their ears may be perked up at attention, especially if they are playing.\nDogs who are fearful may be reluctant to make eye contact and may stare at the floors or walls. They may also do something known as a whale eye, or side eye, where they look towards the object they fear from the side. Nervous dogs often lick their lips frequently or yawn, and their mouth may also be pulled back into a grimace. Anxious dogs also pant frequently and may have their ears pulled back.\nWhen a dog is alert or curious, their facial expressions may resemble many traits of a happy and relaxed dog. In addition, they may also tilt their head to one side in an adorable, quizzical look. Their ears will likely be perked up on top of their head, in an alert posture but may be pulled back as well.\nDogs who are escalating towards aggression often show many changes in their body language. Since aggression often escalates from fear, these dogs may start off by showing facial expressions consistent with fear or anxiety, especially the whale eye orside-eye. If they continue to feel threatened, this may escalate to additional signs including a hard, direct stare, stiff body posture, hair standing up and puffing out,ears pulled back, a lip curl, or showing teeth. These are all high alert warnings that a dog may become aggressive if the situation is not neutralized.\nAnd they love it when you smile.\nWhat tail wagging means\nA classic wagging tail is one of the most well-known signs of happiness in dogs, however, did you know that there are manydifferent ways dogs wag their tailwith different meanings? This is why it is so important to analyze your dog’s body language in the context of what else their body is doing and what’s going on.\nA big clue to the meaning of your dog’s tail wag is its position. A happy, playful dog usually has their tail held at mid-level or lower with a slow, loose wag and overall wiggly body. A nervous or fearful dog will tend to tuck their tail tightly to their body or even between their legs, but the tip of their tail may still be wagging. A dog that is on high alert or acting aggressively will tend to hold their tail up high and have a stiff wave, like a flag. Playful dogs may also hold their tail up high over their body, so it is important to assess the rest of their body language to determine what’s going on.\nUnderstanding dog behavior language\nBody language incorporates all of the elements of your dog’s body in reaction to different situations. It is really important to look at the whole picture, not just one characteristic, to determine how your pup is feeling.\nSometimes, people miss signs of fear and aggression because they focus only on seeing a wagging tail and misread the rest of a dog’s body language. It’s important to look at their overall stance; are they stiff or loose and wiggly? Are they making any sounds like whimpers, growls, or barking? Are they approaching or retreating?What is their tail doing? All of these behaviors offer additional clues as to what a dog is trying to communicate. This includes:\nPlay bows:You’ve likely seen dogs do this when they are trying to get another dog or person toplay with them, or during a play session. One dog hunches down on their front legs while their hind legs, butt and tail wiggle in the air. This is known as a play bow and is a way that dogs invite others to play with them.\nPlay bows:You’ve likely seen dogs do this when they are trying to get another dog or person toplay with them, or during a play session.

A dog who is growling and showing other body language consistent with fear or aggression is putting everyone on alert that they may escalate to more aggressive behaviors. In these situations, if you can safely redirect your dog or remove them from the situation, you can prevent things from escalating; however, you need to protect yourself as well and avoid putting yourself in a situation where you could be bitten.Dogs who  are growling should not be punished; it is a valuable warning tool that gives pet parents a chance to take action before something bad happens. When dogs are punished for growling, they may stop giving that early warning and proceed straight to escalating to more aggressive behaviors. Of course, many dogs will also growl intermittently during play, so once again, you have to look at the big picture to determine if you need to intervene.\nGrowling:Growls are warningsand most commonly signify fear or aggression.

While some of this is likely inherited through the domestication process, a lot of it is learned and only flourishes when dogs are properly socialized around humans. For example, making direct eye contact is considered a sign of aggression between dogs, but humans tend to see eye contact as a form of connection. Dogs who are well-socialized to humans learn to associate eye contact with positive outcomes, but dogs who are not raised around humans do not naturally make direct eye contact. Dogs learn to read human behavior in many of the same ways that we must learn to read their behavior. They assess our overall body language,our facial expressions, the tone of our voice, and our words.\nWe can maximize our ability to communicate with our dogs by using clear and consistent training techniques that help our dogslearn specific cues. We can also help our dogs to communicate more clearly with us by reinforcing behaviors that do that. For example, teaching your dog to scratch at the door, ring a bell, or grab their leash when they need to pee or poop can help your dog communicate their needs to you.\nTools like speech buttons and translation apps reflect more aboutourdesires for our pets than their desires for themselves.\nCommon myths about dog communication\nIt’s important to appreciate that dog communication is complex and nuanced, much like human communication. When we misunderstand a cue or make an assumption that doesn’t fit the situation, we risk missing the message altogether.\nMyths about dog communication tend to oversimplify or generalize the rules about dog body language. For example, we now know not to assume a wagging tail is always a sign of a happy dog. We need to probe deeper to look at a dog’s tail position and other clues in their body language to know whatkindof a wag they are doing. We also need to be cautious about anthropomorphizing animal behaviors, meaning that a dog’s behavior may not mean the same thing as if a human performed that same behavior. For example, when a dog humps a person, this is not a sexual act, but rather a sign of another intense emotion like excitement or anxiety.\nFinally, beware of myths that associate certain behaviors or communication withdominance theories. While dogs do have social hierarchies and sometimes assert dominance over one another when competing for limited resources, this is almost never the explanation for what a dog is communicating to their humans. These myths often miss the message that is actually being conveyed, potentially leading to increased anxiety and frustration for the dog and damaging their trust in humans.\nThe bottom line\nDogs communicate many different messages through their facial expressions and body language.\nDogs communicate many different messages through their facial expressions and body language.\nIt is important to interpret their expressions in the context of what else is going on and to look atall of their body languagetogether in order to accurately assess their emotions.\nIt is important to interpret their expressions in the context of what else is going on and to look atall of their body languagetogether in order to accurately assess their emotions.\nSubtle changes in body language can provide a valuable opportunity for you to intervene before unwanted behaviors escalate.\nSubtle changes in body language can provide a valuable opportunity for you to intervene before unwanted behaviors escalate.\nReferences\nAlbuquerque, N, et al. “Dogs functionally respond to and use emotional information from human expressions.”Evolutionary Human Sciences, vol. 5, no. e2, December 2022.\nAlbuquerque, N, et al. “Dogs functionally respond to and use emotional information from human expressions.”Evolutionary Human Sciences, vol. 5, no. e2, December 2022.\nAlbuquerque, N, et al. “Mouth-licking by dogs as a response to emotional stimuli.”Behavioural Processes, vol. 146, January 2018, pp. 42-45.\nAlbuquerque, N, et al. “Mouth-licking by dogs as a response to emotional stimuli.”Behavioural Processes, vol. 146, January 2018, pp. 42-45.\nCalder, Christine. “Fear and fear-related aggression in dogs.”Veterinary Partner. 3 November 2020.\nCalder, Christine. “Fear and fear-related aggression in dogs.”Veterinary Partner. 3 November 2020.\nCatalan, A, et al. “Recognition of aggressive and anxious behaviors in canines by a group of Chilean veterinarians.Journal of Veterinary Behavior, vol. 38, August 2020, pp. 8-13.\nCatalan, A, et al. “Recognition of aggressive and anxious behaviors in canines by a group of Chilean veterinarians.Journal of Veterinary Behavior, vol. 38, August 2020, pp. 8-13.\nWalsh, Elizabeth Ann. “Human-dog communication: How body language and non-verbal cues are key to clarity in dog directed play, petting and hugging behaviour by humans.”Applied Animal Behaviour Science, vol. 272, March 2024.\nWalsh, Elizabeth Ann. “Human-dog communication: How body language and non-verbal cues are key to clarity in dog directed play, petting and hugging behaviour by humans.”Applied Animal Behaviour Science, vol. 272, March 2024.",

  "page_content": "I’m obsessed with love, always reading up on “how to tell if he really loves you,” and considering the love languages of everyone in my life. When I think of the ways love is expressed — gift giving, quality time, physical touch, words of affirmation, and acts of service — it always seems like dogs do it best. (Yes, even the words-of-affirmation thing because I love dogsso muchI’ve spent my whole career learning to understand them well enough to imagine what theywouldsay if they could. It’s fair to say I’m as obsessed with dogs as I am with love.)\nI generally imagine a cartoon bubble over dogs’ heads expressing their true feelings. One of my favorite things is to tell people that it is my professional opinion that their dogs love them deeply. But how can I tell whether a dog loves their pet parents? By interpreting their behavior, their expressions or emotion, and the choices they make.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nMain takeaways\nDogs are capable of true love, just as we have always suspected.\nDogs are capable of true love, just as we have always suspected.\nDogs bond to their pet parents due in part to the same chemical — oxytocin — that bonds romantic partners as well as human babies and their parents.\nDogs bond to their pet parents due in part to the same chemical — oxytocin — that bonds romantic partners as well as human babies and their parents.\nYour dog’s behavior reveals the love they feel for you.\nYour dog’s behavior reveals the love they feel for you.\nThere are many ways to make your dog love you.\nThere are many ways to make your dog love you.\nDoes my dog love me?\nI still think about this memory: I was sad enough to be crying, and my dog, Bugsy, sensed it. He generally wanted to be near me, but on this occasion, he even uncharacteristically declined a stuffed Kong on the floor to stay on the couch with me. My husband and I were living long distance, and we had just said good-bye for what would be an unusually long absence.\nBugsy offered great solace, licking my face, leaning into me, gazing into my eyes, and looking a little worried with a furrowed brow and an air of calmness. That’s the kind of love we need from our dogs, and though people often wonder if our dogs truly love us, I think deep down most of know that they do. It’s just that we’ve been taught not to assume dogs have the same emotions we do. That’s a shame, because all kinds of scientific evidence support the idea that they do. Knowing that makes us feel better, and denying it serves no purpose.\nDo dogs feel love?\nIf you’re asking, “Do dogs feel love?” or “Do dogs feel love for their people?”, I recommend that you breathe a sigh of relief this instant becausedogs love usjust as we love them. Literally. We know this because of scientific studies of love, and it’s a beautiful thing to know people are investigating what really makes life worth living.\nThe same physiological and chemical reactions people experience in romantic love and in the love that forms between parents and babies are present in both species in the bond between dogs and people. Oxytocin,the so-called love hormone, makes all these types of love form and grow.\n“Does my dog love me?” is one of the top questions I hear from clients in the course of my daily work helping improve the relationship between people and their dogs. I wish everyone knew how real dogs’ love is for their pet parents. Ascientific studya few years back found that dogs and people who gaze into each other’s eyes develop feelings of love because of an increase in oxytocin levels, just as lovers or moms and babies who gaze into each other’s eyes do.\nIn fact, scientists believe that dogs got us to fall in love with them in the first place by hacking into this system of bonding. And I recommend being grateful they did, because the love we share with them is too pure and beautiful to imagine life without it. (Note: Gazing into the eyes of a dog you love can enhance your bond, but never stare into the eyes of a dog you don’t know or one prone to aggression, because staring can be taken as a threat.)\nYou can certainlyfeelthe love.\nHow do you know if your dog loves you?\nIt’s natural to ponder the question, “How do I know if my dog loves me?” That just shows you care, and frankly, it’s easy to judge someone who never takes a moment to google, “How to tell if my dog loves me?” And the answers are plentiful and right here for you to see, because dogs have a lot of ways to show you that they love you. Go ahead, make a list called “signs my dog loves me” and be excited about how long that list is.\nNot alltail wagsare signs of love and happiness, but when dogs wag their tails in an energetic but relaxed way or wag so hard that their whole body gets in on the fun, that’s the kind of behavior we see when they are happy to see someone and to be with them. Those they love the most are certainly going to inspire those enthusiastic tail wags, so if you interpret your dog’s wagging-from-the shoulders back and fully body wiggles as true love, I’m certainly in no position to disagree.\nIn my experience, dogs who have strong bonds with their people tend to have relaxed body language. This shows a level of comfort with the people, and the closeness that comes when the relationship makes them feel at ease.\nDon’t panic if your dog gets tense in certain situations such as when meeting strangers, seeing a coyote, going to the vet, or anything else out of the ordinary that they don’t enjoy. That has nothing to do with their love for you. I’m talking about when your dog is in their element, enjoying life with you. That’s when you see their comfort with you most, including eye contact in a relaxed manner, their mouth open in the universal sign of a happy dog, and a general expression of peacefulness rather than tension.\nDogs roll over to show their belly for many reasons. Some dogs do this for the sake of appeasement, and in that case, it’s best to leave them alone. Other dogs are expressing their interest in playing, and some are doing this because they have learned the result will be abelly rub. In many of these situations, the dog is indicating they have a valued social relationship with you, and love is so often a key factor in relationships.\nOne interpretation of a dog leaning against you is trust and affection. Dogs seem to seek comfort and reassurance from those they trust which is why it’s so often stated that leaning against you is a sign of a loving relationship. It’s also true that some dogs lean on people when they feel nervous, so it’s not always necessarily about love.\nI have often wondered,Why does my dog like to lie on me? This thought has occurred to me when I am sitting down, and there’s a dog lying on my foot. The question has also run through my mind when I am in bed with a dog covering me completely. I feel very loved (but also a little bit squished). It makes sense that dogs like to lay their bodies down on ours for the loving warmth and comfort that close physical contact offers. If your dog likes to rest on top of you, they are acting like loving dogs everywhere do.\nWhen a dog loves you, they want to be close to you. If yourdog is following you aroundthe house when you are home and seeking interaction with you, they are clearly choosing to be near you — a behavior that individuals show when they feel love toward you.\nMany dogs paw at people for attention, frequently to solicit petting. Dogs often seek physical affection from those they love, though plenty of dogs are happy for anyone to pet them. Of course, those may be dogs who reallydoseem to love everybody or perhaps are just a bit pushy. I feel comfortable assuming loving intentions in a dog who uses their paws to get attention, but I am one to see the best in every dog.\nWhydoesmy dog like to lick me? You would think based on the amount of time there’s a dog tongue on my skin that it is made of liver or cheese. There are many reasonsdogs lick their pet parents, but one of them is definitely expressing affection. Dogs are often especially enthusiastic about licking the faces of those they love. Greetings of beloved people often involve lots of licking, and many dogs lick those who they want to be around before going to sleep, which may help soothe them into a restful night.\nDogs often have especially strong feelings of love for the people who play with them. When a dog invites you to play by bringing you a special treasure as though they are sharing toys with you, that can be the sign of a strong bond and a relationship filled with love.\nIf they’re following you around like your shadow, there’s a reason for that.\nHow to make your dog love you\nDogs tend to love those who spendquality timewith them and those who make them feel safe and cared for. So, your quest about, “How to make a dog like me?”, should revolve around being fun, being present, and being kind so your dog will feel safe, secure, and loved.\nRoutine is important for a dog’s feeling of security and sense of wellbeing, so take care of your dog in a consistent, reliable way. One part of that is to stick to an established feeding schedule, and a routine in general. Dogs feel more secure when their world is predictable, and those feelings of security can help feelings of love develop.\nIn my experience, there is nothing more bonding than playing together. Across the animal world, individuals whoplay with each otherhave closer relationships than members of the same species who are less playful. Play also provides exercise, which is an important part of helping our dogs feel their best. When they feel their best, they show us their love and gratitude in return.\nPhysical contact with our dogs affects our physiology and theirs in positive ways.Petting and grooming(as long as it is pleasurable for the dog!) influence their brain chemistry in the same way that romantic love and mother-baby connections do in humans.\nBeing the source of good things will make just about any dog have good feelings about you. Offering treats andrewards through trainingis an especially powerful way to create a bond and strong feelings of love.\nDuring training, your dog will receive all kinds of positive attention, and both of you are working together toward common goals and sharing the joy of accomplishing them. Training is a fun activity to do together, and your dog gets to associate that fun, plus the success of being right and earning treats, with you\nBottom line\nMost people feel such strong love for their dogs that it’s natural to wonder if our dogs love us back. Luckily, loving their pet parents comes just as naturally to the typical dog as to the typical person. That means that the relationship between people and dogs really is true love, just as we have always hoped (and believed).\nReferences\nBaun, Mara M., et al. “Physiological Effects of Human/Companion Animal Bonding.”Nursing Research, vol. 33, no. 3, 1984, p. 126,journals.lww.com/nursingresearchonline/abstract/1984/05000/Physiological_Effects_of_Human_Companion_Animal.2.aspx.\nBaun, Mara M., et al. “Physiological Effects of Human/Companion Animal Bonding.”Nursing Research, vol. 33, no. 3, 1984, p. 126,journals.lww.com/nursingresearchonline/abstract/1984/05000/Physiological_Effects_of_Human_Companion_Animal.2.aspx.\n“For the Love of a Dog: Understanding Emotion in You and Your Best Friend: Patricia McConnell: 9780345477156:Amazon.com: Books.”Amazon.com, 2024,www.amazon.com/Love-Dog-Understanding-Emotion-Friend/dp/0345477154.

  "page_content": "If you haven’t already left an episode ofTed Lassoon for your pup while you’re running errands, you’ve at least wondered: “Would this show keep my dog company?” And you’re not alone: According to aRoverstudy, two-thirds of pet parents leave the TV on while they are away during the day, 60 percent say their dogs have a favorite show, and and 80 percent report that their dog reacts to what’s happening on the screen. But do dogs really enjoy watching TV?\nCamille Ward, a certified applied animal behaviorist, PhD, and founder of behavior consulting companyAbout Dogs LLC, says the answer is complicated.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\n“We know that they can recognize images on the screen, but to say whether or not they enjoy television, I don’t really know, personally, of any dogs that sit there and watch TV,” she says. “It’s not like we can put dogs in front of the TV and it can occupy them like it would a person or a child.”\nRather than paying attention to a show or movie for long periods of time, dogs tend to glimpse at TVs inshort burstswhen something familiar catches their attention, such as another dog on the screen, a ball being thrown, or a doorbell ringing.\nThose soulful eyes mean everything to you—learn all about them.\nWhy do some dogs watch TV and others don’t?\nTelevision-watching behaviors definitely vary by the pup. Your dog might be like my mom’s Golden Retriever, Annie, who dozes on the couch all day without paying the TV any mind. Or, they might be more like my brother-in-law’s Australian Shepherd, Twyla, who will stand up with her head on a swivel anytime a dog is on the screen. Or maybe they’re somewhere in the middle, like my corgi, Charlotte, who doesn’t care about images on the screen but loses her mind every time a doorbell goes off in a commercial (I have a bone to pick with UberEats and Home Depot).\nIt is completely normal for some dogs to watch TV and not others. There does not appear to be evidence that TV-watching is associated with intelligence. Instead,research suggeststhat TV-watching behavior is associated with age, vision, and breed. Younger dogs with good vision tend to watch TV more than older dogs with deteriorating vision. Sporting and herding breeds also tend to watch TV more than others.\nWhy do some dogs watch TV?\nA dog may watch TV for a number of reasons. Usually, aspecific soundor action on the screen will catch their attention, then they’ll watch for a few seconds or minutes. Likely, a dog’s interest in TV comes down to their personality or breed traits. For example, some breeds may also be attracted to certain actions. Terriers, who were bred to hunt vermin, may enjoy squeaky noises on the TV. A herding dog, like Twyla, might be more stimulated by other animals moving on the screen.\nWhat do dogs like to watch on TV?\nAnyone whose dog watches TV likely knows that their favorite subjects are — surprise, surprise — other animals. Arecent studybased on survey responses from more than 1,246 pet parents backs up this theory. Almost 90 percent of respondents said their dogs were most interested in “animal” content, especially dogs. Other topics that caught their attention included “ball sports,” vehicles, non-ball sports, and animation.\nThe colors that dogs can see may also impact their preferences. For example, my friend’s Bernadoodle, Craig, has a thing for Monster’s Inc., specifically Sully. Theoretically, this makes sense, since blue is one of the main colors that dogs can see, and they like to watch other animals.\nWhat do dogs see when they watch TV?\nDogs see the world differently than we do. In a dog’s eye, there are two types of cones versus three in humans, which gives themdichromatic vision. The result is that dogs do not differentiate between as many colors as (most) humans and experience the world in shades of blue, yellow, gray, and brown. In addition to that, dogs function in low light conditions better than humans.\nNext up is the flicker factor. On average, humans don’t see the flickering of a television when the speed is above 55 Hertz. But for dogs who have better motion perception, they’ve been tested on rates up to 75 Hertz. For example, if a television is being displayed at 60Hz, humans would see this as a fluid motion, but dogs would see a set of rapidly flickering images.\nNowadays, televisions and other screens have high-resolution pictures and clear audio, which offer our pups a clear view into another world. Modern HD/4K TVs are refreshed at a much higher rate than older TVs, allowing dogs to view fluid motion. These advances in technology may have contributed to an increase in dogs who watch TV.\n“Years ago, it doesn’t seem that dogs were that motivated by TV because we didn’t have screens like we have today where the flicker rates are really high,” Ward says. “Now if they look at it, they’ll actually see movement, they’ll see motion.”\nWhy does my dog attack the TV?\nThe improved resolution of TV screens may have an unwanted side effect: an increase in dogs who attack their TVs. “I think it’s more of a problem today that dogs are reacting to TVs because they see it, where years ago, it was a lot of flickering and they weren’t as tuned in to it,” Ward says.\nWhen working with clients whose dogs are reactive to TVs, Ward typically recommends a desensitization process, during which the dog is gradually exposed to triggers on the TV, such as an Animal Planet show, at a distance and at a low volume. When they don’t react and remain calm, they are rewarded with treats and praise. Then the pet parents can gradually increase the exposure by raising the volume and bringing the dog closer to the TV, continuing to reward positive behavior.\n“With any problem behavior, the more they rehearse it, the more they practice it, the more it stays in their repertoire and it becomes stronger over time,” Ward says. “So we want to prevent it, and teach them an alternative response and change how they feel about that trigger, which might be animals on TV.”\nDo TVs comfort dogs who are left alone?\nMany pet parents leave a TV on to keep their dogs company when they are going out. So, is there any proof that this actually provides comfort? There doesn’t appear to be any major research on the topic; it likely depends on the dog and their personality.\nFor example, if a dog is used to a rowdy household with a lot of noise and excitement, the sounds of a TV may be more comfortable or “normal” for the dog when left alone, compared to the silence of an empty house. On the other hand, if a dog is skittish, sensitive to noise, or tends to prefer peace and quiet, leaving a TV on likely isn’t doing them any favors.\nWard cautions that turning on the TV can actually become apre-departure cue, or a signal to your dog that you’re about to leave, similar to picking up your keys or putting on a coat. If turning on the TV becomes part of your exit routine, dogs may begin to associate it with you leaving. For dogs withseparation anxiety, this can add to their stress, rather than alleviate it.\nThat being said, you know your pup best. If you’ve been leaving the TV on for them for years and it appears to be soothing, keep doing what you’re doing.\nFAQs\nThere is no evidence that TV-watching is associated with canine intelligence. A dog’s tendency to watch TV is more likely related to their age, breed, and personality.\nDogs’ vision is dichromatic, and they experience the world in shades of blue, yellow, brown, and gray.\nYes, dogs can see muted colors.\nReferences\nByosiere, Sarah-Elizabeth, et al. “What Do Dogs (Canis Familiaris) See?

At times, it almost seems to verge on supernatural abilities. And while you may prefer to think of your pup as a superhero, if you are a person of science, you may be looking for more plausible explanations, too.\nMany times, dogs’ incredible abilities can be chalked up to their incredible senses, which are often far superior to ours. This is especially true of their senses of smell and hearing. In addition to the standard five senses, dogs also have very keen observational skills, especially when it comes to their favorite people. They become experts in our body language and routines. This allows them to sense change long before we think we are acting differently. Read on to learn all about how dogs sense the world and how that leads to their hyper awareness and unbelievable abilities.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents.

Many times, pet parents report that their dog startsacting more clingy, and maybe even insists on resting on their belly. While there have not been any specific scientific studies to date that test whether or not a dog can sense pregnancy in humans, it seems very likely to be true.\nFor one thing, there are many documented examples of dogs sensing subtle changes in smell that coincide with hormonal changes. They can accurately sense when female dogs are biologically receptive to mating. Dogs have also been able to sense when dairy cows are in heat, proving that this ability extends beyond their own species. When it comes to pregnanthumanwomen, dogs may be picking up on a number of cues. There may be changes in scent they can detect based on pregnancy hormones. They may also be using theirkeen observational skillsto pick up on changes in behavior, routine, or emotions. All of this can make a dog acutely aware that a big change is coming, well before we humans are conscious of it.\nSmell: How strong is a dog’s sense of smell?\nA dog’ssense of smellis extremely powerful and may be their most influential sense. It’s reported that a dog’s sense of smell is somewhere between 10,000 to 100,000 times more sensitive than that of humans. They can detect the scent of a person for up to 48 hours after they have left a particular location and can also detect the presence of many chemical compounds at very dilute concentrations, far below a level that humans can smell.\nThis has led dogs and humans to team up in many different fields of detective work. Dogs are often used in search and rescue operations to help search for people who may be buried under rubble or in remote locations. They are also employed to sniff out substances like illegal drugs and dangerous chemicals. Their sniffers have even been put to use in wildlife conservation to detect the presence of certain endangered animals, like the San Joaquin kit fox, the Kakapo, and the Aleutian cackling goose, to help protect them. Finally, dogs have been employed to sniff out a variety of medical conditions in humans including early detection of certain cancers, low blood-sugar in diabetic patients, and seizures in epileptic patients. Their abilities to detect these conditions long before humans are aware of them can be life-saving for many individuals.\nTaste: How many taste buds do dogs have?\nTaste is one sense where you may be able to out-sense your pup. While dogs can taste all five basic flavors, their overall sense of taste is more muted than ours. Like us, dogs have tastereceptors for sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami flavors. However, while we have around nine thousand taste receptors in our mouths; dogs only have about 1,700 on average.\nThis means that they are not likely to appreciatesubtle flavor profiles. It also means that even when they don't like the taste of something, they may try it a few times before they swear off it altogether. They are known to be less sensitive to salt compared to other species as well. And while you may be able to taste things your dog thinks are invisible, keep in mind that smell has a huge influence on taste. Dogs can certainly out-smell our noses, which informs their taste andeating experiencein another dimension.\nSight: What does a dog’s eyesight look like?\nThere are a number of anatomical differences between a dog’s eyes and our eyes which influencehow they see the world. First, most dogs’ eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads, as opposed to the front, and this affects their field of vision. As a result, they can see a wider range of their surroundings but have a smaller overlap of binocular vision, where both eyes visualize the same field. This means that theirdepth perceptionis not as sharp as ours.\nAdditionally, within the retina at the back of the eye, dogs have a different arrangement of rods and cones than humans. They tend to have more rods than cones overall, which helps them see better in dim light or dark surroundings. They also have only two kinds of cones, compared to the three that humans have, making their color vision duller than ours.\nFinally, they have an additional reflective surface on the back of their eye, called the tapetum, which also helps their eyes to capture light and see in the dark. It’s also the reason why your dog’s eyes might look like tiny lasers if you try to take a photo of them using a flash. Overall, dog vision is best suited for seeing a larger overall area, seeing in the dark, and seeing fast-moving objects, while we have the better vision for details and colors.\nHearing: How far can dogs hear?\nDogs are also known for theirsensitive hearingand ability to hear sounds that humans cannot appreciate. This may be due to a number of factors. In general, dogs can hear a greater range of sounds than humans, with dogs hearing sounds in the frequency of 65-45,000 Herz and humans limited to a range of 20-20,000 Herz. They can also hear sounds that are up to four times further away than what humans can hear, up to about 400 meters away. And, they are better at localizing sound, or finding the source of sound. This is likely due in part to the design of dogs’ ears including the large size of their outer ears, or pinnae, and their ability to move their outer ears independently of one another and in the direction of sounds that they are hearing.\nOf course, when you look at different dog breeds across the species, ear shape is one of the most variable traits. While some dogs like German Shepherds have huge ears that stand up on top of their heads like little satellites, other breeds like basset hounds have long droopy ears that may actually muffle sounds. A dog’s hearing may be highly influenced by these aesthetics so don’t assume every dog has super hearing but theymightstill be ignoring you when youcall them from the next room.\nTouch: Why does my dog always have to be touching me?\nSense of touch is experienced in unique ways for dogs. First, dogs have highly sensitive whisker-like projections on their face, known as“vibrissae,”that form a highly sensitive tactile sensory system. These hairs are believed to play many important roles in helping animals stay oriented in space, find their way in the dark, keep their balance, and sense their surroundings. Compared to humans, dogs also have a more dull sense of touch on their digits. While humans have highly-sensitive tactile senses in their fingertips, dogs have fewer tactile receptors in their paw pads.\nIn general, touch is a powerful sense for both humans and dogs when it comes to bonding, even if it is perceived in different ways. Touch is the first sense to develop in newborn puppies before their eyes or ears even open. They use touch to sense where their mother is and seek out her warmth.Enjoyable physical touchalso stimulates the release of oxytocin and prolactin, which cause both animals and people to feel calm, happy and safe. This explains why dogs seek out the gentle touch of their favorite people, and why petting dogs is well-documented to improve human well-being too. It’s an interspecies win-win.\nThe bottom line\nThe five senses provide important feedback about how dogs interpret their world.\nThe five senses provide important feedback about how dogs interpret their world.\nDogs have uniquely powerful senses of smell and hearing.\nDogs have uniquely powerful senses of smell and hearing.\nSense of touch is important for both dogs and humans and is one of the most powerful ways for the species to bond.\nSense of touch is important for both dogs and humans and is one of the most powerful ways for the species to bond.\nYes, dogs can see muted colors.\nReferences\nBarber, ALA, et al. “A comparison of hearing and auditory functioning between dogs and humans.”Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews, vol. 15, January 202, pp. 45-94.\nBarber, ALA, et al. “A comparison of hearing and auditory functioning between dogs and humans.”Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews, vol. 15, January 202, pp. 45-94.\nBecker, Marty. “Touch is not a want.” Veterinary Practice News, 14 February 2022.\nBecker, Marty. “Touch is not a want.” Veterinary Practice News, 14 February 2022.\nJenkins E.K., et al, “When the Nose Doesn't Know: Canine Olfactory Function Associated With Health, Management, and Potential Links to Microbiota.”Frontiers in Veterinary Science, vol. 5, no. 56, 29 March 2018.\nJenkins E.K., et al, “When the Nose Doesn't Know: Canine Olfactory Function Associated With Health, Management, and Potential Links to Microbiota.”Frontiers in Veterinary Science, vol. 5, no. 56, 29 March 2018.\nKiddy C.A., et al, “Detection of Estrus-Related Odors in Cows by Trained Dogs.”Biology of Reproduction, 1978, vol. 19, pp. 389–395.\nKiddy C.A., et al, “Detection of Estrus-Related Odors in Cows by Trained Dogs.”Biology of Reproduction, 1978, vol. 19, pp. 389–395.\nKokocińska-Kusiak A, et al. “Canine Olfaction: Physiology, Behavior, and Possibilities for Practical Applications.”Animals (Basel), 2021, vol. 11, no. 8, 21 August 2021, pp. 2463.\nKokocińska-Kusiak A, et al. “Canine Olfaction: Physiology, Behavior, and Possibilities for Practical Applications.”Animals (Basel), 2021, vol. 11, no. 8, 21 August 2021, pp. 2463.\nPickel, Duane, et al, “Evidence for canine olfactory detection of melanoma.”Applied Animal Behaviour Science, vol. 89, no. 1-2, November 2004, pp. 107-116.\nPickel, Duane, et al, “Evidence for canine olfactory detection of melanoma.”Applied Animal Behaviour Science, vol. 89, no. 1-2, November 2004, pp. 107-116.\nSpense, Charles. “Gastrophysics for pets: Tackling the growing problem of overweight/obese dogs.”Applied Animal Behaviour Science,vol. 256, November 2022, pp. 105765.\nSpense, Charles. “Gastrophysics for pets: Tackling the growing problem of overweight/obese dogs.”Applied Animal Behaviour Science,vol. 256, November 2022, pp. 105765.",

  "page_content": "We like to think we know our pups like the back of our hands —and vice versa.But as deeply bonded as we our to our dogs, their feelings may be more of a mystery than we thought.A new studypublished inApplied Animal Behaviour Sciencefound that humans overestimate our ability to identify dogs’ emotions, and there are some that we’re particularly bad at reading.\nDuring the study, 447 participants were shown 44 short video clips of dogs displaying emotions including anger, appeasement, fear, frustration, happiness, neutral, pain, positive anticipation, sadness, separation-distress, and surprise. After viewing the clips, they were asked to choose which of the 11 emotions the dog experienced.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nThe researchers found that overall, humans have some skill at recognizing emotional reactions in pups. “The findings suggested that humans can recognize many dog emotions at above-chance level purely based on dog visual response/behavior without knowing the associated emotional trigger and wider preceding context,” wrote Kun Guo, the study’s lead author.\nSome emotions are harder to read\nHowever, participants sometimes struggled to identify emotions when presented with only a dog’s facial expression; generally, they were better at reading a dog’s body language. This varied depending on the emotion, though. Participants were able to read anger, anticipation, and surprise as easily through facial expression, but needed bodily cues to identify happiness, sadness, pain, and fear.\nFear and frustration were extra difficult for humans to read. When basing their answers on facial expression alone, humans often confused fear and happiness— and recognizing frustration was even trickier. “In this study, frustration was the only tested dog emotion that did not attract above-chance recognition,” Guo wrote. Researchers propose that this could be because the definition of “frustration” is unclear for some people, or because of “the diversity of situations which might be considered ‘frustrating.’”\nHumans overestimate how well we can read dogs’ emotions\nOverall, humans are decent at understanding dogs’ emotional states — but not as good as we think we are. “In a self-report task, dog owners reported higher performance in recognizing the same range of emotions listed above in their dogs’ daily activities,” Guo wrote, referencinga 2023 study.\nIn the self-report study, researchers found that 96 percent of pet parents believed they could identify happiness, compared to a finding of only 63 percent accuracy measured in the new study; 86 percent believed they could identify distress compared to only 23 percent in the new study, and 89 percent believed they could identify fear compared to only 16 percent in the new study. “Clearly there exists large discrepancies between ‘what we believe’ and ‘what we can do’ in relation to detecting (at least some) dog emotions,” Guo added.\nSo, you may not beas goodas you think you are at reading your dog — but that doesn’t mean you’re not an attentive pet parent Your pup might just be a tougher nut to crack than you knew.",

We tend to think a dog’s teeth chattering means that they’revery coldor even scared (thinkScooby Doo),but these are far from the only reasons that a dog's teeth might be chattering.Your dog’s teeth chattering can mean many different things, and some are more serious than others. The most common causes of teeth chattering veterinarian Dr.Elliott Garbersees include “dental disease, neurological conditions, and even behavioral responses like excitement or anxiety,” he says. In older dogs, periodontal disease is “most often the culprit,“ and “gastrointestinal problems like nausea or reflux can also first reveal themselves through teeth chattering or grinding.”\nHowever, chattering teeth in dogs isn’t always a symptom of a medical or dental issue. Interestingly, says Garber, “we also see storm aversion or phobia as a somewhat regular cause of teeth chattering in parts of the country that experience regular thunderstorms.”\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents.

If you suspect your dog is experiencing dental or oral pain, you should go straight to your vet.\nIf you’re a chronically stressed person or an avid teeth-grinder, you might have been diagnosed with temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ). While you might not think your dog has much to worry about, they can also get TMJ disorder. If your dog’s teeth are chattering and they appear to be in jaw pain, the cause of the chattering could be TMJ disorder. If you take your dog to the vet and they suspect TMJ disorder, they will open and close your dog’s mouth and feel for grinding and resistance. They may also need to give your dog X-rays.\nIf your dog’s teeth are chattering, it could also be a symptom of gastrointestinal (GI) issues. You can look out for other symptoms, including “reduced appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and visible discomfort or restlessness,” says Garber. While it’s normal for dogs to eat grass, Garber says that if your dog has GI issues, you might also notice your dog eating grass more frequently. If you suspect gastrointestinal discomfort, you should see your vet.\nWhile the image of Scooby Doo’s teeth chatteringisfunny, your dog’s teeth chattering could be a symptom of anxiety. If your dog is in a stressful situation, you might notice their teeth chattering. Luckily, this isn’t too much of a cause to worry. Once they are out of that stressful situation, the anxiety should subside, and their teeth should stop chattering.\nOne of the scariest reasons why a dog’s teeth might be chattering is if they are about to have or had a seizure. If you suspect this, you should see a veterinarian immediately. Neurological conditions, such as focal seizures (which only affect one half of the brain) may show up as jaw chattering. If a dog is having a seizure, they may space out and won’t respond to you. There are other symptoms, such as pacing or becoming clingy. If in doubt, you should absolutely call your vet.\nSome dogs, particularly male dogs, may chatter their teeth after smelling a particularly interesting female dog’s pheromones. In fact, female dogs may also do this. According to scientists, dogs do this to try to smell the scent better by bringing the smell into the scent organ on the roof of their mouths. The smell and excitement can also overload their nervous system, leading to that chattering.\nA more worrying reason for your dog’s teeth chattering is a potential ear infection. Infections of the ear can be very painful for dogs, and can be dangerous if left untreated. \"With ear infections, dogs typically show head tilting, scratching at the ears, redness or discharge in the ear canal, and a distinct odor,” Garber says. “You might also notice them rubbing their head against the furniture.\" If you suspect your dog has an ear infection, you should contact the vet immediately.\nOne highly worrying reason for teeth chattering is that a dog is suffering from a neurological disorder. \"Neurological disorders often present with symptoms beyond teeth chattering, such as disorientation, loss of balance, unusual eye movements, or changes in behavior,” Garber says. If you notice these symptoms along with teeth chattering, says Garber, you should contact your vet: “These symptoms require immediate medical evaluation.”\nIf your dog’s teeth are chattering suddenly and they are in an overwhelming or fun environment, they might just be very excited. Keep an eye on whether or not their teeth chattering continues after they have left the exciting environment. If so, you might need to seek medical attention. However, if the chattering starts when they are excited and ends when the excitement has passed, you do not need to worry.\nWhat about the other way around?\nWhen to see a vet for teeth chattering\nA dog’s teeth can chatter for any number of reasons, including ones as normal and every day as being cold or excited. However, there are also many serious reasons for a dog’s teeth chattering, ranging from ear and tooth infections all the way to seizures and neurological disorders. So when do you actually make that call to the vet?\n“Any persistent teeth chattering, especially when accompanied by drooling, head shyness, or difficulty eating, warrants immediate veterinary attention,” Garber says. If you notice these symptoms, he adds, “it could indicate serious underlying conditions requiring treatment.\"\nWhat to do about your dog’s teeth chattering\nIf your dog is just excited or cold, you don’t need to do anything about their teeth chattering, and there’s nothing to be worried about. However, if there are additional symptoms, you should contact your vet.\n\"Any teeth chattering that persists for more than a day, occurs frequently, or is accompanied by other concerning symptoms should be evaluated by a veterinarian to rule out serious conditions,” Garber says. The vet can be expensive, but your dog’s health is worth it. If in doubt, you should seek out an additional opinion from your dog’s veterinarian.\nReferences\nCarl, K. “My Dogs Teeth Are Chattering: What Does It Mean.”Lincolnway Veterinary Clinic, 15 Nov. 2021,lincolnwayvet.com/blog/my-dogs-teeth-are-chattering-what-does-it-mean/.\nCarl, K. “My Dogs Teeth Are Chattering: What Does It Mean.”Lincolnway Veterinary Clinic, 15 Nov. 2021,lincolnwayvet.com/blog/my-dogs-teeth-are-chattering-what-does-it-mean/.\nKos-Barber, Heidi. “Dog Teeth Chattering: What You Need to Know.”Petmd.com, PetMD, 30 Dec. 2021.https://www.petmd.com/dog/symptoms/dogs-and-teeth-chattering-what-you-need-know\nKos-Barber, Heidi. “Dog Teeth Chattering: What You Need to Know.”Petmd.com, PetMD, 30 Dec. 2021.https://www.petmd.com/dog/symptoms/dogs-and-teeth-chattering-what-you-need-know",

Should I switch out my dogs’ current toys for new ones in colors that may be easier for them to see? My dogs seem to like their current toys, but maybe they’re missing out on some extra fun. Why can’t dogs see color like we do? What colors can dogs see?\nLet’s dive into it.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents.

Dogs likely perceive fewer different colors than humans do, but that doesn’t necessarily mean all colors look the same. It may be easier for a dog to pick out a bright blue or yellow toy against most backgrounds, but that doesn’t mean they can’t use motion,scent, or color patterns to play with their favorite toy. You never know: it may be more fun for a dog to have to useall their sensesto find a thrown ball.\nWhat colors can dogs see?\nDogsare colorblind, but not in a way that only lets them see shades of gray. Their color perception is likely closer to that of a human with red-green colorblindness. Because of the structure of their eyes and makeup of their retinas, a dog’s eyesight is less sharp than a person’s. Dog vision is adapted and optimized for identifyingfast-moving objectsin a variety of lighting conditions.\nTo understand how dogs accomplish this, some basic eye anatomy and biology is needed. I’ll try to keep it brief here, but this article goes into more detail if you’re interested. Eyes have two types of light-sensitive cells in them:\nRods, which are more sensitive to light (meaning they can be activated when there’s less of it) and quicker to respond to motion.\nRods, which are more sensitive to light (meaning they can be activated when there’s less of it) and quicker to respond to motion.\nCones, which provide color vision but have a slower response to changes in light.\nCones, which provide color vision but have a slower response to changes in light.\nHumans have three types of cones (sensitive to blue, green, and red), while dogs only have two (sensitive to blue and greenish yellow). Dogs likely interpret these colors as blue and yellow, but it’s hard to know for sure if their brains interpret color information in a similar way to humans. Dogs may also see a bit further into the ultraviolet range than people do, but this is still being investigated. Things in the bluish-green range likely appear to be gray to dogs.\nIn addition to having an extra type of cone to improve color perception, humans have a higher proportion of cones in their retinas. The cones are also concentrated in the area of the eye (the focal point) where light is most likely to hit. Dog eyes have relatively fewer cones, and they’re spaced out more evenly over the surface of the retina. This means that colors likely appear less saturated (intense) to dogs overall.\nSo, what colors do dogs see the best? Research shows that dogs’ cones are most sensitive to light at wavelengths of 429 nanometer and 555 nanometer. A wavelength of 429 nanometer corresponds to a bright blue color, which may be ideal for toys because it contrasts with the ground outdoors and most surfaces indoors. Light at a 555 nanometer wavelength corresponds to a kinda yellowy green. This means your dog likely enjoyed your brat summer (for those who celebrated), which featured the nearby 542 nanometer wavelength range.\nShop this list for dog accessories in hues of blue and yellow.\nWhat colors can dogs see in the dark?\nDogs hold an advantage over humans when it comes tolow-light vision. The increased overall proportion of rods combined with the presence of rods at the focal point of the retina provides advantages to dogs in dim light.\nDogs also see better in the dark due to the presence of a reflective layer in the back of their eye. Thisreflective tapetumsits behind the retina and reflects light not initially picked up by the rods and cones back at them, giving them a second chance to detect it. This means that dogs have a better chance at sensing something in low-light situations, but the way the light reflects may make things a little blurry.\nColor nighttime eyesight in dogs is similar to your own. Cones take a lot of light to activate, so colors aren’t as prominent when the lights are low. Think about sitting in your room with the only light coming from your phone’s screen. If you lay it down in the center of the room, it becomes much more difficult to make out the colors of the leaves of your plants or art on your walls when they’re not directly in the light.\nDogs likely see even less intense color in the dark than people due because of the number and location of their cones. However, dogs can likely see objects and distinguish shades of gray better than humans in low-light conditions.\nThis isn’tThe Sixth Sense, but dogs are powerfully perceptive.\nWhat colors can’t dogs see?\nBecause of the type and structure of dogs’ cones, there are areas of the color spectrum where their vision falls a bit short. This doesn’t mean that they can’t distinguish between colors in these areas, but they likely just appear as shades of the same color rather than distinct colors. The tones where dogs truly don’t see color are in the bluish green range. Dogs likely see objects in the seafoam green to teal range as shades of white and gray.\nIt's always helpful to think back to elementary school (remember ROY G BIV?) or picture a rainbow, pride flag, or the album cover ofDark Side of the Moonwhen you’re thinking about the color spectrum. These colors occur in order based on their wavelength, from longest (red) to shortest (violet). Remembering the color spectrum can help you understand why some neighboring colors appear as the same shade to dogs.\nDogs see red-colored objects as being in the yellow spectrum. Depending on the shade of red, the objects are likely to appear as a dark to brownish yellow.\nAs a blend of red and yellow, orange may appear as a deeper shade of yellow to dogs. Objects of this color may not stand out well against backgrounds with yellow to reddish hues.\nMuch of dogs’ vision is likely in shades of yellow. Objects in the red, orange, yellow, and yellowish green color range likely appear as different intensities of yellow to dogs.\nDogs likely do not perceive many shades of green as color. The greenish-blue range appears as shades of gray, but color vision begins to return as the blues deepen.\nDogs see what we would consider true blue colors very well. Deep blue to indigo objects likely provide some of the brightest colors dogs experience. Blue vision begins to fade to gray when it reaches the greenish end of the blue color spectrum.\nPurple (indigo and violet) objects likely stand out to dogs as well, and they may seem brighter than they do to humans. Dogs may also have some ability to perceive ultraviolet light, which humans cannot see.\nThe bottom line\nSo, what does a dog’s eyesight look like? Because of the differences within their eyes, dogs likely see a less colorful and more blurry world than their parents do. Their vision prioritizes low-light vision and rapid motion tracking over sharpness and color accuracy.

    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/do-dogs-love-christmas-lights"
  },
  "page_content": "Over the past several days, I’ve spent more time than I care to admit standing at my kitchen window, staring down from my fourth-floor apartment at my neighbor’s house across the street, where a crew of workers has been busily constructing a Christmas display that wouldmake Clark Griswold proud. They decorated that house for the first time last year, and gazing down at those twinkling lights made the 5 p.m. winter darkness much easier to bear. So, when a truck pulled up last weekend and I saw oversized, glittery presents, toy soldiers, a snowman, and a giant star being unloaded onto the sidewalk, I almost teared up with gratitude that they were doing it again this year.\nIt got me thinking, though: Are humans the only animals that appreciate a sparkling holiday display? Or will the neighborhood dogs also be excited when their parents walk them past this seasonal spectacle? Judging by the pets in this Instagram Reel below, which shows several dogs (and a couple of cats) taking in Christmas lights as they are driven past in cars, eyes aglow, the answer is yes, absolutely. “This is your reminder to take your dogs to see Christmas lights. They enjoy it more than we do and their time with us is far too short,” reads the first slide, in which a dog hangs their head out the window, sniffing and perking up their ears.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n“Watching pets seeing the Christmas lights makes me so emotional,” reads the caption, and the commenters flooding the post with teary emojis seem to agree (though some chime in to say that their dogs do not enjoy holiday displays). Clickingover to Reddit, more people share stories of their dogs appreciating Christmas lights.\nApparently, this is a thing.\n“We put up a Christmas tree for the first time in our Husky’s nine years of life. She just sits and watches it every night,”one Reddit userwrites. “It’s one of those pre-lit ones that has RGB patterns. I have a playlist and a timer set from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m., and all she wants to do is sit on the couch and take it in.” Another says that not only do they plan to take both their dog and baby on their annual Christmas-light tour, they’re going towear matching outfits. “I’m going right now to show my dogs the lights,”Redditor tewksypoosays. “Why have I never done this before?”\nAre we reading too much into animals’ wide eyes and rapt attention in these scenarios? I asked Colby Julien, animal behaviorist and dog trainer atGeo-Sniffing, whether she thinks dogs enjoy Christmas lights, and she got back to me with an unequivocal “maybe.”\n“Dogs’ reactions to Christmas lights depend on the dog’s personality and past experiences,” Julien says. “Curious dogs with positive exposure to lights and new environments will find the displays intriguing and enjoyable. However, curious dogs startled by motion-activated decorations might feel stressed.” She urges dog parents to watch for signals like lip-licking, “whale eyes,” or cowering, which indicate that your pup is not feeling the holiday spirit.\n“For dogs who seem calm and curious, Christmas lights can serve as mental enrichment, providing an opportunity to associate new sights and sounds with positive experiences,,” Julien says, adding that dog parents should keep in mind that even if their dog is more anxious than curious about Christmas lights, they can still enjoy the holidays together. “Sometimes, the joy for your dog isn’t in the lights themselves, but in spending time with you.”\nYes, dogs can see muted colors.\nField report: Some dogs like the lights, some just want to pee on them.\nDog behavior expert and trainer Nicole Kohanski, founder ofWiggle Butt Academy, is a mom to eight dogs, all named forStar Warscharacters. She took three of them for walks on a brightly lit block to see how they responded to Christmas lights, and reported back to me. “For my first walk, I took my most confident pup, Chewie. He was more interested in smelling the lights near the ground and trying to potty on them,” she told me. “He enjoyed all the new things on his route, but I had to actively manage him from shorting out the neighbor’s lights.” Yikes!\n“Next up was Artoo. She is a happy, confident pup too,” Kohanski says. “The lights weren't her thing, but the blow-up decorations deserved a few warning barks.” That’s two out of three who, if they weren't exactly going wild with Christmas cheer, didn't seem to be Ebenezer Scrooge, either. “Those went so well that I decided to take Obi. He is a little bit nervous about new things,” Kohanski says. “Poor guy only made it to the first house and hightailed it back to safety. I didn’t expect that he would turn and go so quickly!”\nIsAnimal Planetreally their favorite channel?\nIf you go on a tour of the lights, be patient with your pup and their eyes.\nIf you want to take your dogs on a tour of the local lights, Kohanski recommends taking it slow. “Dogs perceive lights differently than we do, because of theireye structureand visual processing. Some dogs could absolutely enjoy the season’s decorations, but other dogs may find them worrisome.” She says paying close attention to your dog’s body language will ensure that what is meant to be a fun holiday outing doesn’t turn into a scary experience.\nAs for me, I’ll be sitting at my kitchen window late this afternoon, not unlike a dog, patiently waiting for my neighbors to flip the switch on their over-the-top Christmas light display. I wonder ifany of my catswill join me…",

  "page_content": "My dog loves chasing frisbees. Whenever he wants to play, he always reaches for the blue one, even though he's got a red one just like it. I want to get my dog a new toy, but does the color matter? I grew up thinking dogs only see in black and white, but are dogs really color blind? If not, what color can dogs see best?\nQuestions like this are common with pet parents trying to make their dog’senvironment and entertainmentas friendly as possible. Dogs are not completely color blind, but they don’t experience the full range of colors that people do. Dogs can see blues very well, and their world is otherwise likely seen in shades of yellow, brown and gray.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nHopefully, they at least fare better than we do when the lights go out.\nDog eyesight 101\nEyesight results from some incredibly complex interactions between light, lenses, nerves, and some jelly. At a basic level, light is electromagnetic radiation, and color is perceived based on the wavelengths of this radiation. Humans, animals, insects, and birds all detect and distinguish between different ranges of this radiation. The visible spectrum, which is perceived as light and color, is a relatively small part of the overall electromagnetic spectrum, which includes very high frequency waves like X-rays and very low frequency radiation like radio.\nWhen electromagnetic energy in the visible spectrum reaches the eye, it encounters the clear surface of the eye, called the cornea. The cornea’s curved surface helps direct light from a wide area into the eye’s anterior chamber. The anterior chamber helps the surface of the eye maintain its rounded shape and allows light to pass through the pupil without interference.\nThe pupil is an opening that can open wide in low-light conditions to allow more light in. It can also constrict in bright conditions to prevent overloading the eye with light and washing out the image. The lens sits immediately behind the pupil and focuses light into the back of the eye. The lens of the eye is normally clear, but defects likecataractscan affect its ability to allow light through and to focus it properly.\nThe vitreous humor is a clear, jelly-like substance that fills the back part of the eye. It helps maintain the eye’s shape, allows light through to the retina, and provides nutrition to cells on the surface of the retina. The retina is where the really complex stuff happens. The surface of the retina consists of rods and cones, which are specialized nerve cells that are stimulated by light.\nRods are very sensitive to light and greatly outnumber cones, which provide color vision. Because rods are so plentiful and so sensitive, they’re very helpful in low-light situations. They may not provide the same level of detail as cones, but they still provide the vital function of allowing vision in low-light conditions.\nThe reflective tapetum gives dogs a bonus to their low-light vision by reflecting light that was not initially captured by the retina back onto the nerves. This reflective layer of the retina gives dog eyes theiryellow-greenish glow. The improvement in low-light vision comes at a cost though — the scattering of light during reflection decreases the sharpness of what a dog sees.\nCones contain different photopigments sensitive to specific wavelengths of light. In most humans, there are usually three types:\nShort wavelength cones are more sensitive to light in the blue wavelength range.\nShort wavelength cones are more sensitive to light in the blue wavelength range.\nMedium wavelength cones are more likely to pick up light in the green range.\nMedium wavelength cones are more likely to pick up light in the green range.\nLong wavelength cones have sensitivity to light in the red spectrum.\nLong wavelength cones have sensitivity to light in the red spectrum.\nThe relative number of rods and cones stimulated gives the brain information about brightness, contrast, and color. The visual center of the brain converts this into the usable information that we think of as vision.\nHow do we know dogs are color blind?\nThe idea of dogs only seeing in black in white is likely due to a misconception. Dog color blindness is similar to human red-green color blindness (dichromatism). Early attempts at testing dogs’ reactions to different colors provided mixed results, but testing over the past forty years provided a consistent answer about what colors dogs can see.\nThe study of colorvision in dogsrelies both on laboratory examination of the cells in their eyes and real-world testing of their capabilities. The proportion of rods in the center of a dog’s retina is much higher than it is in people. This means that they likely prioritize low-light vision over color perception. Examination of the photopigments in dogs’ cones cells showed that they were of a slightly different type than those in people. Dogs’ cones pick up color in the violet-to-blue range and in the greenish–yellow-to-red range; this leaves minimal information about colors in the bluish-green range, which dogs likely see as gray.\nReal-world testing of dogs’ vision lines up with these microscopic observations. Tests involving retinal stimulation and dogs’ ability to discriminate between two different-colored objects show that dogs can perceive and act on differences in color.\nHere’s how to spot the eye condition and help your dog see more clearly.\nWhat colors can dogs see?\nBased on testing, we are reasonably confident that dogs’ eyes can pick up colors similar to a person with red-green color blindness. This means that dogs most likely see things in shades of gray, blue, and yellow. Dogs likely perceive some shades of green as gray, while orange and some reds may appear yellowish. Deep, dark reds may seem to be a muddy brownish color.\nAre all dogs color blind and limited to seeing only these two colors? It’s hard to know for sure. For example, people with tetrachromacy have four types of cones. This genetic mutation is rare and very difficult to detect in humans. It’s possible that some dogs may have a genetic change that results in the production of an extra type of cone, but they likely wouldn’t be identified unless they were one of the extremely small number of dogs that happen to take part in vision studies.\nThe other big question is if dogs process and perceive color information in the same way humans do? Color perception may be slightly different for each person — we can agree that the sky is blue, but do we see the exact same shade of blue? After all, what color was that dress? Dogs may perceive color differently than people do, but color does seem to be an important part of their decision-making process.\nA 2013 study evaluated whether dogs would pursue a reward based more on the color or brightness of stimuli. Dogs consistently chose based on color, showing that they likely consider color information more strongly than brightness alone.\nA 2017 study used a modified version of the Ishihara test for color blindness in people. This is a test that you’re likely familiar with, featuring a pattern of dots that form differently colored numbers or shapes. The test was modified in dogs so that the colored dots formed the shape of a running cat, which animated and played in a loop. In the study, the dogs’ reaction to the animation was used to determine which color of moving dots they were able to pick out against a gray background.\nDespite the difficulty in figuring out how to know what a dog is seeing and if their reaction to visual testing is not influenced by other factors, researchers have done a good job of showing that dogs can distinguish some colors. While their color vision is not as deep as most people’s, dogs still rely on it in their day-to-day life.\nReferences\n“Eyes and Spectrometers.”Upenn.edu, 2022,www.sas.upenn.edu/~ksundeen/spec%20project%20stuff/Eyes%20and%20Spectrometers.html.\n“Eyes and Spectrometers.”Upenn.edu, 2022,www.sas.upenn.edu/~ksundeen/spec%20project%20stuff/Eyes%20and%20Spectrometers.html.\nJordan, Gabriele, and John Mollon. “Tetrachromacy: The Mysterious Case of Extra-Ordinary Color Vision.”Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences, vol. 30, Dec. 2019, pp. 130–134,vision.psychol.cam.ac.uk/jdmollon/papers/JordanMollon2019Tetrachromacy.pdf,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cobeha.2019.08.002.

  },
  "page_content": "We’ve all heard about wolves howling at a full moon, but when I take my dogs out for walks at night, it kind of feels like a myth. Instead of looking at the sky, their eyes are fixed on the ground, where they might find a scrap of stale discarded food. Have these domesticated creatures strayed too far from their lupine ancestors to remember their natural instincts, or did someone just make it all up?\nThe jury’s still out on that specific call of the wild, but wedoknow thatmoon phasesaffect pets in peculiar ways. Studies have shown that dogs and cats are more active during certain lunar activities than others, and emergency room visits spike during certain cyclical periods as well.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nThe final full moon of the year is this Sunday, Dec. 15; it will be what’s known as a “cold moon,”which meansit will rise and set at the most extreme northerly points on the horizon. Thisonly happensevery 18.6 years. If you suspect your pet might be brushing up on their astronomy and acting accordingly this weekend, here’s everything you need to know.\nWhat are the moon phases?\nMoon phases denote the various shapes the moon takes on when seen from Earth. The moon does not create its own light; instead, the glowing orb we see at night comes courtesy of the sun, which illuminates the moon from afar. The moon orbits Earth, which orbits the sun. The constantly shifting alignment between these three bodies means that we see the moon from different perspectives each day.\nA full-moon cycle takes about four weeks to complete and includeseight phases: new moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, waning gibbous, third quarter (also known as “last quarter”), and waning crescent.\nFor our purposes, the most important of these are the new moon and the full moon. As its name suggests, the new moon marks the start of the lunar cycle. It occurs when the illuminated half of the moon faces away from Earth, making it invisible in the night sky. The full moon, when the illuminated half of the moon is completely visible, occurs halfway through the lunar cycle.\nHow do pets react to a full moon?\nAnecdotally, many pet parents suspect that their critters become a little wilder during the full moon. But does this theory actually hold water?\nThe full-moon shift is the stuff of legend for both human doctors and veterinarians. “There is a long-standing belief among emergency room personnel (human and veterinary) that ‘crazy things happen’ on a full-moon shift,” says Raegan Wells, emergency and critical care specialist. That’s why, back in 2007, she and fellow researchers at Colorado State Universitychose to study ER datafrom 1992 to 2002 to see if the statistics added up.\nWells and her team compiled the 10 years’ worth of data — nearly 12,000 case histories of dogs and cats treated at the university’s veterinary medical center — and found that cats were 23 percent more likely to incur emergencies during full-moon days. Dogs, meanwhile, were 28 percent more likely. The emergency events studied included cardiac arrest,epileptic seizures, and trauma.\nTo be clear, these findings do not indicate that ER caseloads were higheron the nightof the full moon. “What we found is that when we group the nights heading up to, including, and following a full moon, and compared those to the other days in the lunar cycle that there was a higher volume of cases,” says Wells. The spike in ER visits was starkest during the moon’s three fullest stages — waxing gibbous, full, and waning gibbous.\nWhy are dogs more likely to get a full-moon-adjacent injury than cats?\nAs for why dogs outpace cats in this study, Wells offers a couple theories: Most emergency rooms treat more dog patients than cats. Plus, cats are more likely tolive outdoors— which could mean that if they get sick or injured during a full-moon night, their parents wouldn’t know or seek treatment immediately.\nWhile the study’s observed risk increase of injury around the time of a full moon seem high, Wells also notes that the raw-number increases were relatively low because of the limited number of animals treated at the clinic on any given day. On fuller moon nights, the numbers went up by about one cat or dog. Because of that, she says, “It would be necessary to repeat this study in a higher volume setting to see if the results are reproducible.”\nIf a larger experiment yields similar findings, Wells says, “it may provide worthy evidence to consider increasing resources in animal emergency rooms on fuller-moon nights.”\nWhile we’re at it, how does thenewmoon affect pets?\nWhile things seem extra spooky with pets on a full moon, there is also some connection to pet behavior on a new moon. In human astrology, the new moon is a time to take a step back, meditate, and focus our intentions. That said, there’s reason to believe that our furry kinfolk have a different set of priorities.\nIn 2023, astudy publishedin the international research journalApplied Animal Behaviour Sciencefound that free-range domestic cats (aka, cats who live outdoors) displayed more nocturnal activity around the new moon — which mimics the behavior patterns of their wild brethren, according to co-author Dr. Janko Skok, a professor at the Department of Animal Science at the University of Maribor in Slovenia.\nThe research team behind the 2023 study observed the cats’ activity as it related to three different natural patterns: the lunar cycle, seasonal cycle, and the circadian cycle (meaning, their behavior across a 24-hour day). Of these three categories, Skok notes, “the lunar cycle was of particular interest to us because there were (surprisingly) no studies on the activity of domestic cats in relation to the lunar cycle, only on their wild counterpart, the wild cat.”\nAs for why domestic cats turned out to be more active during darker nights, especially the new moon, Skok says that predators in the animal kingdom often copy the activity patterns of their prey — and cats’ primary prey, rodents, are also mainly active during low light.\nNew moon nights are the darkest in the lunar cycle. Because of this, Skok says, “The higher activity around the new moon could be related to cats having one of the most sophisticated night vision abilities, which increases their hunting success.”\nSo, should you keep an eye on your pet during the full moon?\nAs for whether you will notice your cat or dog exhibiting more frisky behavior during a full moon (this weekend or in the future), eh.Maybe. It might just be that you notice more about your surroundings during a full moon. Per Wells, your pet could be acting wacky on other nights, too, but you just perceive them more, because you are looking out for anything weird to happen.\n“What I think we are safe to say is that people notice animal activity more on fuller moon nights,” she says.  “The jury is still out, in my opinion, as to whether this is driven by the full moon or if we remember things more vividly on full-moon nights.”\nReferences\nNASA. “Moon Phases - NASA Science.”Science.nasa.gov, 2024,science.nasa.gov/moon/moon-phases/.\nNASA. “Moon Phases - NASA Science.”Science.nasa.gov, 2024,science.nasa.gov/moon/moon-phases/.\nNeva Merčnik, et al. “Chronobiology of free-ranging domestic cats: Circadian, lunar and seasonal activity rhythms in a wildlife corridor.”Applied Animal Behaviour Science,\n Volume 269,\n 2023.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2023.106094\nNeva Merčnik, et al. “Chronobiology of free-ranging domestic cats: Circadian, lunar and seasonal activity rhythms in a wildlife corridor.”Applied Animal Behaviour Science,\n Volume 269,\n 2023.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2023.106094\nRice, Doyle. “December 2024 Full Moon: This Weekend’s “Cold” Moon Will Feature a Lunar Rarity.”USA TODAY, 10 Dec. 2024,www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/12/10/december-2024-full-moon-cold/76861822007/.

The technical term for burping is eructation, and it occurs when air or gas distends the stomach, triggering a relaxation of the passageway between the stomach and esophagus. This allows the air to escape upwards, and create a burping sound as it passes out through the mouth.\nBurping is most common shortly after eating or drinking; dogs typically swallow some air while they are doing these things. Dogs that are burping more frequently throughout the day, have very foul-smelling burps, or additional symptoms includingchanges in appetite, weight loss, vomiting,diarrhea,or loud stomach rumbling are more likely to have an underlying medical condition that needs to be checked out by a veterinarian.\nConsider it the mother of all dog emergencies — if your dog has it, take them to the vet ASAP. Learn how to spot the condition and how it's treated.\nWhy do dogs burp?\nAnything that causes air or gas to build up in the stomach will trigger a burp. Some of the most common causes include:\nWhenever dogs eat or drink, they also swallow some air which can lead to burping. Some dogs burp more than others after eating and drinking and this may be affected by the way they eat, including if they eat too fast, and the type of food they are eating.\nMany different underlying health problems can also cause burping if they contribute to additional air or gas accumulation in the stomach. This includes digestive problems like food sensitivities, abnormally slow movement of the digestive tract known as poor motility, and breathing problems including upper airway disorders andrespiratory infections. These can increase the amount of air dogs swallow, or cause more gas to form during digestion, leading to more burping.\nStress and anxietycan cause more burping in two ways. The first is that many dogs will develop digestive upset when they are stressed and this can affect how quickly food moves through their stomach and whether additional gas accumulates in the process. The second is that anxious dogs often swallow more air as a result of panting and whining.\nBrachycephalic dog breeds— like like French Bulldogs, Shih Tzus, Pekingese, Pugs, and Bulldogs — that tend to have smushed faces tend to routinely swallow more air than other dogs. This is a result of common deformities in their airways and respiratory pathways. As a result, their stomachs become more distended with gas, leading to more frequent burping.\nHow do I get my dog to stop burping?\nSince burping is a natural reflex, it is not possible to stop dog burping altogether, but there are steps you can take to try to minimize the amount your dog burps. Some strategies to consider are:\nIf you notice that your dog tends to burp the most right after eating, aslow feeder bowlmay help. These bowls are designed with extra nooks and crannies to make it impossible for dogs to scarf down their food. It helps slow them down and take smaller bites, which may prevent them from gulping so much air.\nThis is another good strategy for dogs that tend to eat too quickly and may be swallowing a lot of air in the process and for dogs that have motility problems. Try splitting your dog’s feedings up into multiple portions that you can feed throughout the day. This will prevent your dog’s stomach from getting so distended at each meal and may help with someunderlying digestive problemsthat could also cause burping. You can also use this as an opportunity to put some of these meals into puzzle feeders toprovide mental enrichmentat the same time.\nSome dogs accumulate additional gas in their stomach if they have a food allergy or other digestive issues. This may cause irritation and inflammation within the digestive tract as well as prolonged transit of the food through the digestive tract. Consult your vet for the best recommendations for dog food for your pup’s specific gastrointestinal issues. Your dog may need aspecial diet like a hypoallergenic formula, a sensitive stomach formula, or low-fat food option.\nExercise can be both a promoter of healthy digestion and may cause delayed digestion in other instances. Slow to moderate exercise like walking can help to promote motility in the digestive tract, meaning that it may help material move through more quickly. Be sure that your dog gets adequate daily walks. High-energy exercise, like running andagility work, can actually slow digestion and emptying of the stomach.\nThis means that you should plan accordingly if you know your dog will be engaging in high intensity activity. Avoid feeding your dog large meals right before or right after this kind of activity. Choose small meals that will be packed with nutrients and time them so that your dog is not exercising with a full stomach.\nThere are a number of medical conditions that can lead to increased burping along with other changes in your pup’s health. It is important to consult with your vet if you notice other concerns, or if your dog continues to burp frequently despite making some of the changes listed above. There are effective medications that help with specific digestive problems and it is best to address these signs before they lead to more serious health problems.\nLook out for thesewarnings signs so you know when to call the vet.\nShould you go to the vet because of your dog’s burping?\nIf your dog is burping very frequently or has other concerning changes in their health, it is important to see a vet right away. For dogs that only burp occasionally after a meal, there is nothing that can be done to stop them, despite your hopes forbetter table manners.\nBurps are not dangerous, but they may be an early indication of more serious problems. Certain digestive problems can lead to an increase in the accumulation of gas within the stomach, which may then lead to more burping. This includes conditions like food allergies,inflammatory bowel disease, and motility disorders that slow the emptying of the stomach.\nAny time a dog hasadditional signs like vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, loss of appetite,or pain, they need to be checked out by a vet right away. Dogs that have a lot of gas or fluid in their stomach may also be at risk for extreme stomach distension,known as bloat. This can be very painful and can also put them in danger of a life threatening condition where their stomach can then twist, known as a gastric dilatation and volvulus,or GDV. Dogs with this condition have much more extreme signs including gagging or dry-heaving without producing any vomit, weakness, collapse, or a visibly distended, painful abdomen. Any of these signs are amedical emergencyand require immediate medical attention.\nFAQs\nBurping is 100 percent normal in dogs, but excessive burping could be a sign of an underlying medical condition.\nWhile you cannot completely stop your dog from burping, there are steps you may be able to decrease the amount they burp by changing their feeding routines and taking other preventative measures.\nYes, if you believe your dog is burping excessively and/or they have any other signs of illness, it is important to have them evaluated by a vet.\nReferences\nCave, Nick.Canine and Feline Gastroenterology:Chapter 15 - Gastrointestinal Gas: Eructation, Borborygmus, and Flatulence.

  "page_content": "When an older dog suddenly starts falling with their head tilted to one side, many pet parents assume the worst. Is it a stroke, seizure, or brain tumor? While it’s natural to fear these symptoms, they can also indicate a less serious condition called “old dog” vestibular disease, or idiopathic vestibular disease. It earned its name because it primarily affectssenior dogs. (Most dogs diagnosed with this form of vestibular disease are more than five years old.)\nThe signs are identical to those of many other vestibular diseases. However, this one is unique in that it is considered idiopathic, meaning it has no clear underlying cause. Most of the time, treatment is aimed at keeping dogs comfortable, while controlling symptoms such as dizziness and nausea, until the condition resolves itself over a number of days.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nMain takeaways\nVestibular disease is an umbrella term for many conditions affecting a dog’s balance.\nVestibular disease is an umbrella term for many conditions affecting a dog’s balance.\n“Old dog” vestibular disease, also known as idiopathic vestibular disease, primarily impacts elderly dogs and does not have a known underlying cause.\n“Old dog” vestibular disease, also known as idiopathic vestibular disease, primarily impacts elderly dogs and does not have a known underlying cause.\nMost canines with “old dog” vestibular disease recover within a few weeks.\nMost canines with “old dog” vestibular disease recover within a few weeks.\nStill, any dog demonstrating a loss of balance or other vestibular or neurological issues should see a vet right away.\nStill, any dog demonstrating a loss of balance or other vestibular or neurological issues should see a vet right away.\nWhat is vestibular disease in dogs?\nVestibular disease in dogs is a balance disorder similar to vertigo in people. Common symptoms include a head tilt, nausea, rapid eye movements known as nystagmus, and difficulty walking (or even standing). Idiopathic vestibular disease is the most commonly diagnosed form of vestibular disease in pets.\nWith idiopathic vestibular disease, the cause is typically unknown, and treatment is focused on supportive care. However, causes of (non-idiopathic) vestibular disease in dogs may include innerear infections,hypothyroidism,tumors, stroke, certain infections, and/or traumatic injuries to the brain or nerves.\nAs dogs age, it’s important to recognize both physical and mental changes they may be experiencing.\nAny breed can be susceptible to idiopathic vestibular disease, and there are no breeds who are more at risk. However, (non-idiopathic) vestibular disease is more likely in breeds who are predisposed to ear infections. They include Cocker Spaniels, Boston Terriers, Boxers, Shar Peis, Poodles, Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, Beagles, Basset Hounds, and otherbrachycephalic dogssuch as French Bulldogs, Pugs, and Pekingese.\nWhat causes vestibular disease in dogs?\nThe vestibular system is a series of fluid-filled tubes and receptors in the inner ear that help with balance. When this system is disrupted, dogs feel dizzy, cannot tell which way is up, and have trouble standing and walking.\nThe vestibular system may be disrupted within the brain, where this information is processed. This can be caused by traumatic injuries to the brain as well as certain infections, strokes, and/or brain tumors.\nBut it can also be disturbed peripherally (or outside of the brain): in the inner ear, where the vestibular system is located, or along the route of nerves that transmit messages and reactions. This can occur due to traumatic injuries, inner ear infections, reactions to certain medications, andhypothyroidism.\nAlthough idiopathic vestibular disease is a peripheral condition, it does not have a known cause. However, it’s thought to be due to physical changes in the vestibular system that occur with age.\nHow is vestibular disease in dogs diagnosed?\nVestibular disease is diagnosed based on observed symptoms. Dogs who exhibit signs such as a head tilt, nystagmus (rapid eye movements), and loss of balance — but have normal awareness and movement of their limbs — are likely to have aperipheral vestibular problem. This means the problem is not within the brain but in the periphery, such as with the inner ear.\nWhen a dog shows these signs, a veterinarian will try todetermine the underlying causethrough a physical exam, by conducting bloodwork (to check forconditions like hypothyroidismand infections), and by checking for an inner ear infection. In some cases, advanced imaging, such as an MRI, may be recommended to rule out other conditions.\nIf the vet suspects that the dog has idiopathic vestibular disease, pet parents are often advised to monitor their pet for 72 hours to see if the condition starts improving before investing in expensive, and possibly unnecessary, diagnostic tests. However, in cases where thevet suspects acentral vestibular problem (ie within the brain), these additional tests are necessary to determine the underlying cause.\nIdiopathic disease can only be diagnosed byruling out the other causes of vestibular disease. With this in mind, your veterinarian may recommend a complete check-up (including a thorough physical exam, bloodwork, urinalysis, and ear cytology) to look for infections and other issues.\nInner ear infections are relatively common causes of vestibular disease. When the inner ear is inflamed, it can interfere with the vestibular system, which is located in the same area. But diagnosing an inner ear infection is complicated, since this part of the ear cannot be easily accessed.\nTo look for signs of an inner ear infection, both ear canals are examined. The presence of anouterear infection can be a clue that there is also inner ear disease. Technically, you can’t see the inner ear during an ear exam because the eardrum obscures the view. But when there is severe inner-ear disease, your vet may be able to see signs of inflammation and/or pus on the inner surface of the eardrum. Additional tests can help evaluate the inner ear, including X-rays of your dog’s head, obtaining a fluid sample from the inner ear, and/or advanced imaging like an MRI.\nYour vet may discuss using advanced imaging, such as an MRI, to evaluate the inner ear and brain. This is a very useful and effective diagnostic tool, however, it does have some drawbacks.\nFirst, the machine is usually only available at specialty hospitals,emergency referral centers, and academic institutions (like veterinary schools). Second, dogs need to be completely still for the procedure, which means they must be anesthetized. Not every dog is a good candidate for anesthesia, so for dogs with multiple underlying medical conditions, the risks may outweigh the benefits. Third, for all of the reasons listed here, this is an expensive diagnostic test. It typically costs upwards of $1,500 for the procedure, including anesthesia and the time your dog will spend in the hospital. For this reason, an MRI is best reserved for dogs suspected of having a central vestibular issue in their brain, or for vestibular disease that is either not improving after many days or is getting worse.\nAs a rule of thumb, if there is gradual improvement within 72 hours, the dog likely has idiopathic vestibular disease and additional testing is not necessary. It can take a few weeks for signs to completely resolve, and some dogs may have a persistent head tilt even after they seem recovered. If there is no improvement, or they seem to be getting worse and/or developing additional symptoms, additional testing is recommended.\nWhat are the symptoms of vestibular disease in dogs?\nDogs with idiopathic vestibular disease typically show some combination of the following signs:\nA head tilt, in which a dog’s head may seem permanently tipped to one side\nA head tilt, in which a dog’s head may seem permanently tipped to one side\nAn unsteady gait, loss of balance, or falling over known as ataxia\nAn unsteady gait, loss of balance, or falling over known as ataxia\nCircling in one direction, or walking in circles\nCircling in one direction, or walking in circles\nEyes rapidly moving from side to side, known as nystagmus\nEyes rapidly moving from side to side, known as nystagmus\nDrooling orvomiting, secondary to nausea and dizziness\nDrooling orvomiting, secondary to nausea and dizziness\nStanding with legs spread wide to stabilize their balance\nStanding with legs spread wide to stabilize their balance\nChanges in eating or drinking habits\nChanges in eating or drinking habits\nDogs with ear infections may also showsigns of painwhen their ears are touched, exhibithead-shaking, and have a bad odor (or discharge) in their ears.\nDogs who have a central vestibular problem may have all of the above symptoms alongside additional ones such as changes in their awareness, deficits in their motor function,seizures, and more. In these cases, your vet may run tests to differentiate a central vestibular problem from a peripheral one.\nTreatment for vestibular disease in dogs\nTreatment for vestibular disease is based on the underlying cause. In cases where a specific reason for the condition is identified, you must follow your vet’s treatment plan consistently to help your dog recover.\nOn the other hand, when it comes to idiopathic vestibular disease, most dogs make a full recovery without any specific treatment. During the first few days of their illness, your dog may feel really awful from all the dizziness. Your vet can provide supportive care that will help with these symptoms, including medications for nausea and motion sickness. They may also recommend supplementing with fluids, either through an IV or under the skin, to help your pup stay hydrated if they are not eating and drinking normally.\nIt is important to get a diagnosis from your vet before attempting to treat your pup at home. This is because many of the factors that cause vestibular disease, both centrally and peripherally, can look similar at first — and you want to be sure to give your dog more specific treatment, if needed.\nOnce your dog is at home recovering, there are several things you can do to support them.\nSet up a specific room or block off an area that will be your pup’s recovery pad. If they are extremely dizzy and unable to walk much, you’ll want to make everything very accessible to them.\nSet up a specific room or block off an area that will be your pup’s recovery pad.

As you see your pup improving, it will get easier and easier to care for them.\nIn cases where a dog’s vestibular disease is suspected to have a more long-term or potentially terminal diagnosis, such as a brain tumor, it is important to consider what’s most humane for them and how to best maintain their quality of life. In some cases, effective treatment options are available, while in other cases, palliative care may be the best approach. Be sure to speak with your vet about all of these considerations, and make a plan that honors both you and your pup’s needs.\nThe amount of time a dog will live with vestibular disease depends on the specific cause of their condition. Idiopathic vestibular disease does not typically shorten a dog’s life expectancy at all. After recovery, dogs with idiopathic vestibular disease continue to live normal lives, although they may have mild residual signs such as a head tilt.\nIf a dog’s vestibular disease is caused by a brain tumor or severe head injury, the long-term prognosis may be more uncertain. In these cases, it is very important to consult your veterinarian to understand what to expect in the future.\nIdiopathic vestibular disease is not fatal. A majority of dogs will make a complete recovery within a few weeks even without any treatment. However, since there are so many possible causes for vestibular disease, it is important to understand that some of these (such as tumors, severe head trauma, and certain types of infections) can be very serious and in some cases, fatal.\nIdiopathic, or old dog, vestibular disease cannot be prevented. The reason it occurs is unknown, but it is suspected to be related to changes in the vestibular system that simply occur with age. Some forms of vestibular disease (such as hypothyroidism and ear infections) can be prevented through early screening and treatment.\nBy staying on schedule with your dog’sroutine physical exams and bloodwork, you can catch, and get treatment for, minor conditions (such as ear infections) right away to prevent them from escalating. As always, keeping your dog healthy with ahigh-quality diet, daily exercise, andmental enrichmentis a great way to prevent many health problems throughout life.\nFAQs\nThe vestibular system is a series of highly specialized fluid-filled tubes, receptors, and nerve endings within the inner ear. This system helps regulate a dog’s balance.\nYes, vertigo is a term used in human medicine to describe the same phenomenon.\nThe condition is called “old dog” vestibular disease because it is most common in dogs, more than five years old and may be related to changes that occur due to age. “Old dog” vestibular disease is actually another name for idiopathic vestibular disease.\nWhile a stroke can cause signs of vestibular dysfunction in dogs, a stroke will also cause other abnormalities consistent with a central problem within the brain. Your vet can determine if your dog’s signs are consistent with aperipheral vestibular problem or a centralvestibular problem during a physical exam. To definitively diagnose a stroke or other problem within the brain, advanced imaging like an MRI is typically required.\nBottom line\n“Old dog” vestibular disease, aka idiopathic vestibular disease, is a self-limiting condition that usually resolves on its own within a few weeks.\n“Old dog” vestibular disease, aka idiopathic vestibular disease, is a self-limiting condition that usually resolves on its own within a few weeks.\nIt is very important to have your vet diagnose the condition.

  },
  "page_content": "In an ideal world, dog walks are a pleasant way to unwind — for you and your pup. You see some sights, they smell some smells, and everyone comes home happy. But where should you walk a reactive dog who flinches at the mere sight of a stroller, barks at strangers, or cowers in the face of cars?\nLife with ajumpy dogis no less rewarding, but these harried hounds have different needs than their more easygoing counterparts. As pet parents, we owe it to them to make their walks feel as safe and rewarding as possible, and that starts with the location.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhat do you say, do you wanna go outside? We asked certified behavioristMelissa Simpson, owner and head trainer atHappy Tails Dog Training LLCin Grand Rapids, Michigan, andStephanie Barger, dog trainer and owner ofCanine Zen, which offers remote dog training throughout the United States, to help us scout out the best places to give reactive dogs some fresh air.\n“Walking and/or exercising reactive dogs can be challenging,” Simpson says. “Step one is understanding what triggers your dog’s reactivity: people, other dogs, loud noises, sudden movements, or a combination of things. Step two is choosing situations to set your dog up for a low stress walk.”\nIf your pup acts diabolical on walks, you are not alone. Here’s what you can do.\nWhere should you walk a reactive dog?\nEvery dog is going to have their own preferences. Some dogs are fine around people but terrified of other dogs. Some can’t stand loud noises. Others freak out aroundcrowds of kids. Before you start scoping out locations, make a list of your dog’s biggest triggers so that you know what to avoid.\nPer Simpson,triggers may includebut are not limited to other dogs, unfamiliar people, prey animals (like squirrels), birds, and cats, and movement from vehicles or pedestrians.\n“No single example will work for every dog,” Barger says. “The key is to determine what triggers your dog's unwanted behavior and pick places where you are less likely to encounter them.”\nOnce you’ve made a list of triggers and brainstormed promising places accordingly, scout them first without your dog to get the lay of the land. Once you’ve found a good spot, bring your dog (plus lots of treats) and take things slowly. Here are some suggestions for places you can go:\nFor dogs who are afraid of vehicles and city sounds, a park could be an ideal place for a walk. Still, not all parks are created equal. Simpson recommends looking for spaces that feature “clear and open lines of sight during low activity times of the day, with plenty of space to step off the walking path and provide your dog the opportunity to focus on you and/or search for treats on the ground while distractions pass.”\nWhenever you’re outside with your dog, make sure that your contact information is up to date on both their microchip and their tags. Even if your dog is chipped, it’s crucial that they wear ID because not everyone who finds a lost dog will know to have their microchip checked.\nIf you want to make sure you and your dog will have room to yourselves,consider using Sniffspottorent a private outdoor spacefor your dog to run around and train. Simpson also recommends checking with locally owned pet-friendly shops and privately owned dog parks. “Many are offering times you can sign up to bring your dog shopping or to the park when it is just you and your dog for a specified period,” she says.\nMuch like a clear park, a wide, barrier-free field will allow your dog to see what’s coming in all directions while playing and exercising, Simpson says. For dogs that get anxious when they can’t gauge all possible threats, this could provide a feeling of extra security.\nIf you happen to have an outdoor space of your own, and especially one that’s fenced, why not help your dog take advantage of it by turning it into a doggie theme park? Simpson suggests setting upfind-it gamesand obstacle courses, playing hide and seek, and teaching your dog new tricks.\nEvery pup can benefit from a little retail therapy—and you deserve to feel at ease, too.\nHow do you plan for walks with a reactive dog?\nThis will depend on your dog’s specific triggers. For most dogs, however, consider planning your outing for a quiet, low-traffic hour when triggers will be less frequent.\nSimpson recommends checking out the location before you go to ensure it’ll provide a positive experience. “Whether your dog is overly excited, nervous, or fearful, the fewer stimuli, the easier it is for your dog to enjoy the time outside if there are less distractions,” she says.\nSimpson also recommends bringing along a few positive reinforcements like treats and treasured toys. Finally, she says, make sure that you yourself bring a positive attitude and are ready to support your dog as they explore a new place.\nWhere should you not walk a reactive dog?\nJust like every reactive dog’s preferred walking places will vary, so, too, will the list of spots to avoid. That said, there are some common factors to consider.\n“Usually, very loud and busy locations are difficult for dogs,” Barger says. “However, any place where your dog's triggers are present will put your dog on edge and you will want to avoid them unless you are working a behavior modification program to help them feel better about their triggers.”\nSimilarly, Simpson suggests avoiding high-traffic areas like city sidewalks and parks, pet stores, dog parks, bus stops, playgrounds, crowded parks and trails, or fairgrounds. As tempting as dog-friendly restaurants and bars might be, they’relikely not a great place for a reactive pooch, either. Same goes for gatherings with lots of unfamiliar people — even at your own home.\nUltimately, our experts’ general advice is the same: stay away from anywhere your dog exhibits discomfort.\nTurns out, even experts have a hard time defining these terms.\nWhat are signs that your dog is scared on a walk?\nAny time you’re out with your dog, it’s crucial to monitor their behavior and body language to make sure they’re feeling secure and content. If you notice subtle or overt signs of stress, it might be time to call it a day and gently guide your dog home.\n“Your dog can display signs of discomfort before they overreact which gives you a chance to change the situation so that you don't get the unwanted behavior,” Barger says.\nSome signs of anxiety will be obvious: pulling on the leash, lunging, barking, growling, snarling, shaking, cowering, et cetera. Others will be quieter. Watch how your dog holds their ears, tail, and head, their mouth movements and breathing patterns, and their relative body tension or relaxation.\nAccording to Simpson, some signs of discomfort could include yawning when not tired, head dipping, turning the head away, squinty eyes, large pupils, changes in tail position, mouth open versus closed, ears forward versus back, and quick flicks of the tongue.“If you are concerned your dog may be fearful on a walk, it may help to have someone video your dog’s body language so you can watch it after your walk to look for these more subtle changes in your dog,” Simpson says. From there, you can “assess what was happening around your dog at the time, and that will provide a start as to what your dog is fearful about on your walks.”\nWhatever you do, Simpson says, if your dog is showing signs of reactivity, it’s worth considering professional help.\n“Dogs do not ‘outgrow’ these behavior issues,” she says. “While not every reactive dog will learn to enjoy a dog park or dog friendly restaurant, a good behavior trainer will help you and your dog learn the best possible way to keep your dog happy and in a good emotional state.”",

  "page_content": "We know: Life is stressful. You’re reminded of that fact pretty much every time you step outside, scroll through social media, or click open a news notification. But if there’s any motivation for cutting down on doomscrolling and taking time for a little self-care, it’s this: Our dogs are picking up on our stress — and it’s making them anxious. In astudy published in October, researchers at Queen’s University Belfast looked at how pups and humans react to stress and found that when pet parents’ heart rates increase, our pets’ do, too.\nHow the study worked\nFor the study, the researchers fitted 28 dog parents and their dogs with heart rate monitors. Half of the pet parents were then given a digital test meant to induce stress. The other half were given a guided meditation, which included breathing exercises and affirmations, such as “My dog brings me joy.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nAfter the digital test, pet parents’ heart rates had increased.

In both cases, the change in the pet parents’ heart rates impacted their pets. “Changes in owner HR significantly predicted changes in the HR of their dogs, suggesting that dogs exhibit emotional contagion and social referencing towards their owners in novel situations,” Aoife Byrne, the study’s lead author, wrote. “Acute changes in owner stress levels can produce rapid changes in canine physiological stress parameters.”\nInterestingly, the researchers also found that overall, the dogs’ heart rates decreased over time. “This emphasizes the importance of allowing dogs to acclimatize to novel environments,” Byrne wrote.\nResearchers hope that these findings can help make stressful situations, including veterinary visits, less upsetting for dogs. “By devising strategies to mitigate owner stress in veterinary settings, canine stress may, as a result of reducing owner stress, also be alleviated,” Byrne wrote.\nAnxiety, pet parents, and dogs\nThe results support previous research thatanxious pet parents raise more anxious pups.One 1997 paperfound that the personalities of pet parents with “aggressive” dogs tended to be more tense than the pet parents of dogs without a history of aggression.Another study published in 2018found that pet parents who scored low on the “emotional stability” trait — one of theBig Five personality traits— were more likely to have dogs with behavioral issues. “Dogs belonging to high stress/anxiety clients are often higher than average in their stress levels and exhibit more anxiety or hyperarousal,” Kim Brophey,author ofMeet Your Dog: The Game-Changing Guide to Understanding Your Dog’s Behavior,told Kinship.\nIn other words, whether you’re training your pup, taking them to theirannual vet visit, or just spending some quality time together, keep in mind that your attitude may be contagious. A couple of deep breaths and positive affirmations might be the best thing for both of you. And hey, splurge on that spa day, while you’re at it. What’s good for you is good for your pup — it’s science.",

  "page_content": "It’s just about that time of year when venturing outside starts feeling like a nearly impossible chore. After all,insideis where the blankets, heaters, and hot chocolate are. Trust us: Your dog probably feels the same way — especially on chilly rainy days, when they look at you with pleading eyes while hunkering down for fear they might melt. And don’t evenget us started on snowstorms.\nBut all the same, your pup needs just as much exercise in winter as any other season. It’s the best thing you can do for their mental and physical health — plus, it’s great bonding for both of you. So, with this in mind, it’s important to learn some ways to have active indoor fun with your dog. Here are some strategies you can use to keep your dog busy when it’s too dreary to play outside.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nCreate an indoor obstacle course\nThis is a great way to keep your dog active. Start by creating a course that works in your home safely — for example, you could have your pup tunnel through a cardboard box, jump around pillows, and then jump through a hula hoop. It’s important to start slowly, adding one obstacle at a time, until you can safely build up to five or six steps.\nAt my house, we typically use a few items for obstacle courses:\nOld couch cushions: We’ve kept a set of six (rather large) cushions from a previous IKEA couch and allow our kids and dogs to play with them. They make great tunnels and landing pads because they are large and sturdy.\nOld couch cushions: We’ve kept a set of six (rather large) cushions from a previous IKEA couch and allow our kids and dogs to play with them.

You can use this time to help your dog explore new surfaces and textures. Think: rough doormats, aluminum foil, silicone mats, or even walking across cardboard.\nOnce you’ve set up some obstacles, have your dog start at the beginning. You can encourage them by leading them through the exercisewith a treat.Just as with any training, start slow, and once it clicks, you can add in a verbal cue. Above all else, remember to have fun and celebrate every success with a treat.\nTry indoor boot camp\nIf your dog is not one for agility, consider doing a basictraining boot camp. Indoor training is the perfect time to shore up your dog’s skills by practicing important behavior cues like come, stay, and leave it.\nPlay the game “toy search”\nOther fun indoor games include canine nose and hide and seek, but what if you mix it up a bit? Try playing a variant on these with a game called “toy search.” Here’s how:\nStart with your dog in the sit position.\nStart with your dog in the sit position.\nNext, place a toy on the floor.\nNext, place a toy on the floor.\nOnce you release your dog, reward them for getting the toy.\nOnce you release your dog, reward them for getting the toy.\nDo this a few more times before adding in a verbal cue. With a bit of practice, your dog will be able to search for toys farther away and even under other objects.",

  },
  "page_content": "As pet parents, we’ve all probably heard the idiom “let sleeping dogs lie,” but where did it come from? Is it ever safe to do so, or are we better off leaving our dogs to bark in their slumber? According to Dr. Julia Albright, a veterinary behaviorist at the University of Tennessee, it’s best to leave a sleeping dog alone for the same reasons it’s best to let people sleep uninterrupted. That said, it’s not an absolute rule.\nAs someone whose dogs are often quite active in their sleep, I have no doubt that they dream, but it’s hard not to wonder what they dreamabout. When the little fluffy one is barking and pumping in his legs in his sleep, does that mean he’s chasing a squirrel? When my jumpier baby is twitching and whining with her eyes closed, is she having a nightmare? (Also, do dogs even have nightmares?) Dr. Albright walked me through it all.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhy are you not supposed to wake a sleeping dog?\nDr. Albright had actually not heard the “never wake a sleeping dog” maxim before, but she agrees with its wisdom to an extent. If you’re considering waking your dog for any reason, she advises asking yourself,How would you like it?\nDogs cycle through different sleep stages, just like humans do, Dr. Albright says, and just like when you wake up a person, dogs might be startled if you jostle them, say, mid-REM cycle. If your dog is prone to aggression, they might react just like they would when awake — which could be unpleasant.\n“It totally depends on the dog,” Dr. Albright says. “I think for most dogs, it's actually fine [to wake them up].” The real key is how you go about it. If you need to wake your dog up, Dr. Albright suggests doing so in a gentle way like saying their name or gently stroking them, similarly to how you might wake a child.\nDogs need more sleep than humans. Here’s how much is healthy.\nA very rare subset of dogs might have REM sleep disturbance, a neurologic disorder, in which they wake themselves up. Some of those dogs might become aggressive, Dr. Albright says, but the condition is very rare. If you suspect your dog might have it, they will require veterinary attention.\nAlthough it’s traditionally been hard to study sleep in dogs, what we’ve learned so far indicates that dogs reap the same benefits from uninterrupted sleep that humans do — better cognition and less grogginess. Sleep also helps with memory formation.\nDogs tend to sleep a lot throughout the day, which Dr. Albright says is perfectly healthy. That said, they also often adjust to their humans’ schedules, which means they sleep through the night. Whenever your dog catches their Z’s, give them time to enjoy every last one if possible, just like you’d want for yourself.\nDo dogs actually dream?\nTheysuredo. As Dr. Albright points out, dogs have similar sleep architecture to humans, and their brainwave activity during sleepalso mimics our own.\nResearch has shown that animals can retain long sequences of events that happened during the day andexperience complex dreamsconnected to their own experiences. That said, it’s impossible to knowexactlywhat their experience of dreaming is like.\nJust like with people, it depends on their experience. Stanley Coren, a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of British Columbia and author of the2012 bookDo Dogs Dream? Nearly Everything Your Dog Wants You to Know,told Live Sciencethat when researchers have temporarily deactivated the pons, which is what renders us motionless in sleep, dogs have acted out all sorts of scenarios — from Pointers pointing at birds to Dobermans chasing someone in hot pursuit. Basically, your dog is likely to dream up scenes that’ll feel familiar or at least related to their waking life.\nIt’s a personal preference, but here are the pros and cons.\nInterestingly, this might depend on the size of the dog. Coren told Live Science that smaller dogs dream more often in shorter bursts, while larger dogs dream less frequently but for longer periods of time. According toVCA Animal Hospitals, research indicates that a toy poodle might dream every 10 minutes for about one minute apiece, while a bigger dog like a Labrador Retriever might dream only once every 60 to 90 minutes, but for as long as five to 10 minutes at a time.\nSigns your dog is dreaming\nLook for the rapid eye movement, which Dr. Albright confirms is a sign that your dog is in REM sleep. You might also notice some twitching, barking, or movement in the rest of the body — anything that indicates what Dr. Albright calls the “proverbial rabbit chasing.” This, too, could indicate your dog is dreaming up something fun.\nWhen it might be necessary to wake a dog up from a dream\nAccording to Dr. Albright, probably never. Again, this isn’t so much a hard-and-fast rule as a “treat the family dog the way you’d like to be treated” situation. “There’s a purpose to all this,” Dr. Albright says. Just like we would like our sleep to remain uninterrupted, our dogs deserve the same; no one wants to be startled awake.\n“We have to assume that uninterrupted sleep is a good thing,” Dr. Albright says. “It’s good for the body; it’s good for the brain. I would say leave your dog alone while they’re sleeping.”\nHow to know if your dog is having a bad dream\nAccording to Dr. Albright, it can be hard to say whether a dog is having a good dream or a bad dream. Speaking withPeople, certified applied animal behaviorist Carly Faughnsaid that bad dreamsmight bring more whining, yelping, or growling. Regardless of what kind of dream your dog might be having, however, Dr. Albright says that it’s best to let them keep sleeping.\n“Even if they look somewhat upset, the harm that might be happening emotionally is probably minuscule,” Dr. Albright says. If you wake them up, “you’re likely to surprise them and startle them, and nobody likes that.”\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nDoes the dog's breed affect their dreaming?\nBreed matters less than other factors. The subject matter of your dog’s dream will depend on their day to day life, and the frequency will depend on their size — not the specific breed.\nWhy do dogs twitch in their sleep?\nLike rapid eye movement, Dr. Albright says twitching can be a sign that your dog is in REM sleep. Speaking with theAmerican Kennel Club(AKC) Coren said that puppies and older dogs are most prone to twitching in their sleep because of the pons, which is underdeveloped in the former and not as effective in the latter.\nJust like in every other scenario, Dr. Albright advises against waking up your dog if you notice them twitching. It’s likely just a sign of normal, healthy REM sleep.\nIt’s very unlikely that your dog is having a seizure in sleep, Dr. Albright says, because seizures tend to be stress-induced, and sleep is not a particularly stressful time. If your dog has no history of seizures, this is probably not a concern.\nReferences:\nAaliyah Pasols. “Yes, Dogs Dream.

  "page_content": "Dogs have an impressive ability to hear sounds that are far beyond the range of human perception. Their acute sense of hearing allows them to detect noises at great distances, making them highly attuned to their surroundings. Whether it’s the faint rustle of leaves or the distant call of another animal, dogs can pick up sounds that often go unnoticed by us. This keen sense is one of the many remarkable traits that make dogs such attentive and responsive companions.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat is a dog’s hearing range?\nYou may have seen your dog pop up from a deep sleep, suddenly alert and focused on something you can’t see or hear. While it’s always possible that your house is haunted, it’s more likely your dog is reacting to a sound that you can’t hear. This could make you wonder,How far away can a dog hear?\nThe ability to hear something depends on a number of factors, such as:\nLoudness:Louder sounds are heard more easily, even if they are very brief or very distant.\nLoudness:Louder sounds are heard more easily, even if they are very brief or very distant.\nPitch:The pitch, or frequency, of a sound affects its ability to be picked up and processed by the ear.

Low-pitched sounds (think the bass from a car driving by) travel farther in air than high-pitched sounds.\nLength:Sounds usually need to last 100 to 200 milliseconds to be heard, but the loudness of a sound may shorten this time to as low as one millisecond.\nLength:Sounds usually need to last 100 to 200 milliseconds to be heard, but the loudness of a sound may shorten this time to as low as one millisecond.\nContent:Dogs and humans both prioritize sounds important to their survival. Dogs are more reactive to cries in the frequency range created by puppies than they are to those in the range of human babies, even if the cries themselves are the same.\nContent:Dogs and humans both prioritize sounds important to their survival. Dogs are more reactive to cries in the frequency range created by puppies than they are to those in the range of human babies, even if the cries themselves are the same.\nDistance:The strength of sound falls off over distance. A dog will react to a command given from 20 feet away but will nothear that same commandspoken at the same volume a mile away.\nDistance:The strength of sound falls off over distance. A dog will react to a command given from 20 feet away but will nothear that same commandspoken at the same volume a mile away.\nSo, can dogs hear better than humans? Assuming appropriate ear health, anatomy, and nervous system function, it seems like dogs may be able to hear sounds of the same loudness at a distance about four times greater than a human can. This varies based on the pitch though. It seems that dogs perceive low-frequency sounds at about the same sensitivity as people but can hear high-frequency sounds from further away.\nAlthough much research has been done into dogs’ ability to hear different pitches and localize the location a sound is coming from, not as much effort has gone into figuring out the distance at which sounds are audible. This means that the data for this is not as strong as it is for other aspects of hearing.\nThere’s a lot more to your pup’s furry appendages than you might think.\nHow does dog hearing work?\nDog hearing works similar to many other animal species. Hearing isincredibly complex, but the basics process follows this path:\nSound reaches the outer ear, which is shaped in a way that it collects sound waves and directs down the ear canals into the middle ear.\nSound reaches the outer ear, which is shaped in a way that it collects sound waves and directs down the ear canals into the middle ear.\nThe tympanic membrane (ear drum) sits between the outer ear and middle ear. It helps to transfer vibrations to the middle ear and protect the structures within. The middle ear helps to amplify sounds and pass them through the tiny auditory bones to vibrate the oval window.\nThe tympanic membrane (ear drum) sits between the outer ear and middle ear. It helps to transfer vibrations to the middle ear and protect the structures within. The middle ear helps to amplify sounds and pass them through the tiny auditory bones to vibrate the oval window.\nThe oval window separates the middle ear from the inner ear. The vibrations pass through the fluid within the inner ear and stimulate miniscule hair cells that convert the sound into electrical signals.\nThe oval window separates the middle ear from the inner ear. The vibrations pass through the fluid within the inner ear and stimulate miniscule hair cells that convert the sound into electrical signals.\nThese signals are transmitted by cranial nerve VIII to the brain, where they are processed and perceived as sound.\nThese signals are transmitted by cranial nerve VIII to the brain, where they are processed and perceived as sound.\nHaving two ears helps dogs to localize sound. The slight differences in loudness and timing of the sound picked up by each ear are registered in the brain. This gives a 3-D idea of the distance and direction the noise originated from. Dogs can distinguish the source of sounds as little as 7.5 degrees apart.\nDog hearing has been tested extensively over the years. Although the results have varied a bit, it seems that the lower limit of pitches that dogs perceive is around 65 hertz. Dogs can hear a wide range of pitches, with sounds up to at least 45 kilohertz being perceptible. One study found that dogs may be able to hear up to 60 kilohertz. Being able to hear very high-pitched sounds likely helps them hunt small prey.\nIt’s pretty well known that dogs can hear much more high-pitched sounds than people can, which can lead to your dog getting worked up about noises you can’t hear. Humans have been reported to hear sounds as low as 16 hertz, though sounds beneath 30 hertz may be felt more heard. This means that people can hear low bass sounds better than dogs can.\nDogs significantly outstrip people in high-frequency hearing though. Human hearing caps out around 20 kilohertz, about half to a third of the frequency a dog can hear. Mid-to-high–frequency hearing worsens with age in both dogs and people. A dog’s hearing in the 8-32 kilohertz range starts to decline at around eight to ten years of age.\nAnother difference in hearing between dogs and people is sound localization. People are actually better at localizing the source of a sound than dogs are. While dogs can accurately locate a sound within about 7.5 degrees, humans have an accuracy of about two degrees. So, humans are a little better at pinpointing the location of a sound, while dogs can hear a wider range of sounds.\nBut first, how to spot the early signs of hearing loss.\nSounds only dogs can hear\nWhat sounds can dogs hear that people can’t? Sounds that are in theultrasonicrange for people may be perceptible to dogs. Some things may create noises that you can’t hear but your dog can, such as:\nDog whistles\nDog whistles\nElectric motors (vacuum cleaners, power drills)\nElectric motors (vacuum cleaners, power drills)\nUltrasonic pest repellers\nUltrasonic pest repellers\nSmall rodents\nSmall rodents\nBats\nBats\nElectronics\nElectronics\nEarthquakes\nEarthquakes\nWhile the quiet, high-pitched noises created by rodents may just alert your dog to something you can’t hear,loud noisescan cause problems. Dogs often react with fear or signs of anxiety when a loud, persistent high-pitched sound is encountered. Your dog isn’tangry at the vacuum cleanerbecause it’s bulky and weird; they’re mad because it’s screaming at them.\nDecoding the many sounds your pup makes.\nWhat factors affect hearing in dogs?\nBecause hearing is so complex, a number of factors can affect a dog’s ability to hear. Some of these are present from birth, while others develop over a dog’s life.\nIn general, smaller animals hear pick up on higher frequencies than larger animals. Dogs of all sizes react with similar speed to sound, but it’s possible that small dogs may pick up on higher pitched sounds better than large dogs. This difference is unlikely to be significant in a dog’s day-to-day life though.\nTheconformation and sizeof a dog’s ears make some difference in the loudness of sound that can be picked up on. Flappy ears may dull sounds a little bit, but even dogs with long, droopy ears can still hear well. Cropping a dog’s ears lessens their ability to hear and locate the source of sounds. Please,nevercrop your dog’s ears.\nSome breeds are prone to partial orcomplete deafness. Some of the breeds in whichdeafnessfrom birth is most common include:\nDalmatians (up to 30 percent are born deaf)\nDalmatians (up to 30 percent are born deaf)\nBull Terriers\nBull Terriers\nEnglish Setters\nEnglish Setters\nEnglish Cocker Spaniels\nEnglish Cocker Spaniels\nAustralian Cattle Dogs\nAustralian Cattle Dogs\nDapple Dachshunds\nDapple Dachshunds\nPuppies are born with their ear canals closed. The canals open at around twelve to fourteen days of age, and hearing abilities progressively improve until pups are about eight weeks old. Hearing sensitivity naturally begins to fall off when about eight to ten years old.\nEar infections are one of the most common conditions affecting hearing in dogs. Dogs with chronic otitis can have thickening or scarring of their ear canals, affecting the way sounds are transmitted through the ear. Middle or inner ear infections can damage the delicate structures that help sound information reach the brain. Trauma, cancer, and inflammatory diseases can all affect the areas of the brain that process sound as well.\nFireworks and thunderstorms aren’t the only things that make them say,“No, thanks!”\nFAQs:\nDogs can be sensitive toloud or persistent noises. Because dogs can hear high-pitched sounds that people can’t, your dog may react negatively to something you can’t perceive. Try to find out what’s causing your dog’s reaction and turn it off.\nAnynoise can stress a dogout. Dogs seem most sensitive to very loud, sudden, or persistent noises, but even quiet noises can cause stress if your dog wants to investigate it and can’t find the source.\nReferences:\n‌“Engineering Acoustics/Outdoor Sound Propagation - Wikibooks, Open Books for an Open World.”Wikibooks.org, 2018,en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Engineering_Acoustics/Outdoor_Sound_Propagation.\n‌“Engineering Acoustics/Outdoor Sound Propagation - Wikibooks, Open Books for an Open World.”Wikibooks.org, 2018,en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Engineering_Acoustics/Outdoor_Sound_Propagation.\n‌Kemper, Debra L., et al. “Canine Brainstem Auditory Evoked Responses Are Not Clinically Impacted by Head Size or Breed.”Physiology & Behavior, vol. 110-111, Feb. 2013, pp. 190–197,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2012.12.006.

  },
  "page_content": "Dogs scratching bed sheets is a behavior that can stem from various instincts, often rooted in their wild ancestors’ habits of creating comfortable resting spots. However, this action can indicate other issues, like boredom, anxiety, and frustration. Here’s how to identify the root cause.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhy does my dog dig in my bed? Common reasons\nDogs have scent glands in their paws, scratching allows them to move their scent around. Your dog may mark your bed by scratching at the sheets. You may notice that your dog does this more frequently after a set of clean sheets. Because the clean sheets will smell like laundry detergent, they may want to mark them with their scent.\nEven though dogs have evolved from their ancestors into household pets, there are still some habits and behaviors that they continue to do. Wolves and wild dogs will scratch and dig at an area to get comfortable before laying down for the night. You may notice your dog digs and scratches at your sheets and blankets before lying down to go to sleep. They are doing this to get comfortable and make a spot to rest.\nWhen dogs are bored, there is a higher chance of them getting in trouble or becoming destructive. When a dog has no outlet for their energy or no way for them to occupy their time, then they may dig at your sheets. When a dog does this for boredom, it may scratch a hole in your sheets.\nSome dogs are curious by nature and enjoy investigating, especially when something new is around. Did you get a new blanket? Is the texture different? Are there different smells on your sheets? You may find your dog shows interest in the new items and wants to investigate them. They may do this by scratching the blanket or sheets to move them around and discover more about them.\nScratching and digging are stress-relieving behaviors for dogs. They are calming behaviors. When a dog scratches, it can help relieve stress. If you notice that your dog is doing this consistently, and you cannot interrupt the scratching, then you may need to reach out to your veterinarian to help understand why your dog is stressed and how to get them relief.\nCertain dog breedsloveto dig; it’s in their nature. It is always important to research dog breeds before purchasing or adopting a dog. Make sure the breed characteristics are what you are looking for and that their traits are something you are interested in living with for the rest of their life. Some breeds that are known for digging are Beagles, Terriers, Dachshunds, and Huskies, to name a few.\nWhat’s behind the desire and whether it’s safe to do.\nHealth-related reasons for bed-scratching\nParasites can cause your dog to be uncomfortable and require a vet visit. Many parasites require medical treatment. When dogs are uncomfortable, they may display unusual behaviors, such as digging your sheets. If you notice your dog acting out of the ordinary, it is time to schedule a vet appointment to better understand what is wrong.\nAn anxious dog may scratch because scratching is a calming behavior. If you notice the scratching and anxiety are causing difficulty in your dog’s life and making everyday activities difficult for them, seek help from your veterinarian. If you cannot interrupt your dog when they are scratching, or if your dog is scratching so much that they are injuring their nails to the point of bleeding, this may be a red flag.\nThe length of your dog’s nails is extremely important to your their health. When dogs have long nails, it causes complications with their gate. When your dog’s nails are too long, it can prevent their paw pads from touching the ground properly, which can cause issues with their posture and improper weight distribution that can affect their joint health. Long nails can get caught and pulled unnecessarily, causing pain, bleeding, and a possible vet visit. Your dog may scratch at your bed sheets or other items to try to deal with how uncomfortable they are feeling.\nIf your dog is scratching your bed, and it seems out of the ordinary, it may be a good idea to get them checked by the vet. There could be an underlying skin condition.\nThere are pros and cons of sleeping with your dog — for both of you.\nHow to manage your dog’s scratching\nIf your dog is scratching due to medical reasons, stress, or anxiety, it’s best to involve your veterinarian. Your dog’s quality of life may be affected if they are suffering from certain medical complications causing them to scratch your sheets.\nIf your dog is scratching for comfort, this is a normal behavior and it’s OK to allow your dog to engage in this behavior, as long as you don’t mind. If it bothers you, ask your dog to stop or remove them from your bed.\nDepending on how rough your dog is when scratching, you may want to teach them appropriate outlets to dig in, like the dirt or sand, so they do not dig in your things. You can start by burying a treat deep enough that your dog can smell it but would have to dig for it. When they start digging, you can name the behavior “dig,” and continue to say dig as your dog digs for treats. Over time, your dog will understand what it means to dig. Next, say the command, and when your dog digs, you can reward them with a treat directly from your hand (no longer bury them in the ground). Over time, this behavior should be reinforcing enough that your dog is rewarded by the act of digging (rather than a treat), and it should help curb your dog’s want to dig inappropriate items.\nIt’s a personal preference, but here are the pros and cons.\nFAQs:\nYourdog may burrowto get cozy or feel safe. Just like humans love to get cozy under their favorite blanket, your dog may enjoy that too. Small or short-haired dogs may burrow to get warm.\nTreat-dispensing toys or frozen snacks or toys can be helpful toentertain your dogwhile you are away. If you will be away for long periods of time and your dog finds that difficult, it may be good to enlist the help of a dog walker.\nYour dog may dig in your bed when they are excited, because they are using digging as a displacement behavior. A displacement behavior is when your dog does a normal behavior that is out of context for a situation. So instead of running around and getting zoomies, or mouthing your arm or clothing, they may dig in excitement.\nReferences:\n“How to Stop Attention-Seeking Behavior | Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine.”Vet.tufts.edu,vet.tufts.edu/news-events/news/how-stop-attention-seeking-behavior.\n“How to Stop Attention-Seeking Behavior | Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine.”Vet.tufts.edu,vet.tufts.edu/news-events/news/how-stop-attention-seeking-behavior.\n‌“Anxious Behavior: How to Help Your Dog Cope with Unsettling Situations.”Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, 3 Aug. 2022,www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/riney-canine-health-center/canine-health-information/anxious-behavior-how-help-your-dog-cope-unsettling-situations.‌\n‌“Anxious Behavior: How to Help Your Dog Cope with Unsettling Situations.”Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, 3 Aug. 2022,www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/riney-canine-health-center/canine-health-information/anxious-behavior-how-help-your-dog-cope-unsettling-situations.‌",

A new study published inScientific Reportsfound that heart rate variability (HRV) — the variation in timing between each heartbeat — matches up between dogs and their humans when they spend time together.\nThe study\nResearchers at the University of Jyväskylä studied 30 medium-sized dogs from 13 different breeds. The dogs’ parents were surveyed on their personalities, including their levels of extroversion and negative affectivity.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nDuring the experiment, dogs and their humans were connected to an ECG to measure heart rate variability, the small variations in time between heartbeats. The experiment started and finished with a resting period. In between these periods, the dogs and their humans were given four tasks: stroking, training, sniffing, and playing.\nThey found that the difference in the dog and humans’ heart rate variability correlated significantly during several of the tasks, such as playing and stroking. They also matched up during the baseline resting periods and at times of free interaction, leading the researchers to conclude that the mirroring wasn’t solely dependent on the tasks. “These findings suggest emotional co-regulation of the HRV of dogs and owners beyond their correlations due to synchronized physical activity,” Aija Koskela, the study’s lead author, wrote.\nInterestingly, dog parents who reported higher levels of negative affectivity were more likely to feel close emotional bonds with their dogs, which affected the dogs’ physiological responses. These pet parents were more likely to have high HRV, and so were their dogs. “In fact, owner-related factors appear to affect the relationship even more than the characteristics of the dog,” Koskela wrote.\nPrevious studies have shown that HRV levels between emotionally connected humans,including mothers and infants,synchronize during social interactions. The researchers believe that emotional connection is why dog and human HRV synchronizes, too.\nThis finding only held true between dogs and their pet parents — not between dogs and random humans. This proved that the dog and human heartbeats weren’t matching solely due to external environmental factors; there was a relationship component at play. “We conclude that the physiological and emotional mechanisms involved in strengthening attachment bonds between humans also support the emotional relationship between humans and dogs,” Koskela wrote.",

  "page_content": "Following a day of snuggles, treats, and endless attention, does your dog ever let out the biggest sigh, as if they are the ones who have to pay taxes and go to work 40 hours a week? Come. On.\nDog sighing, however silly it seems, is a common behavior that can convey a range of emotions and physical states, such as relaxation. While a dog’s sigh is frequently a sign of contentment, it can also indicate other feelings, such as mild frustration, boredom, or even discomfort.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhy does my dog sigh? Common reasons for dog sighing\nAgain, noone seems to sigh more than a dog who doesn’t have a job, doesn’t pay bills, and has everything taken care of for them. So, what exactly do these sighs mean? Veterinary behaviorist Dr. Valli Parthasarathy shares that there can be a variety of meanings for a dog’s sighs, including contentment, discomfort, attention-seeking, frustration, and more.\nContentment and relaxation is one of the most common reasons for a dog to sigh, according to Parthasarathy. “If you have a dog who sighs every time they lay down, it is possible that they are getting comfortable, and they just are giving a big exhale of, ‘Okay, I’m comfortable now.”’\nSighs of contentment can be your dog’s way of letting you know they are comfortable and happy. They may occur when your dog is settling down after a walk or game of fetch, when they like the wayyou are petting themor when they are curling up for a nap. You can usually tell if a sigh is a “happy” sigh, or a sigh of relaxation based on the situation and your dog’s body language. Some other signs of contentment and relaxation include the following:\nYour dog’s ears and tail are relaxed, not tense and alert\nYour dog’s ears and tail are relaxed, not tense and alert\nYour dog is wagging their tail\nYour dog is wagging their tail\nTheir eyes look “soft,” or relaxed and half-opened\nTheir eyes look “soft,” or relaxed and half-opened\nYour dog may sigh to communicate to you how they are feeling. My Corgi, Charlotte, certainly lets out a little “huff” when she drops a ball at my feet and I don’t immediately pick it up. A sigh can be a way to communicate a variety of things. They could be telling you they want to go outside, they want the food you’re holding, they don’t like how loud the TV is, or like Charlotte, they want you to throw that ballright now.\nIn addition to sighing, barking, and other vocalizations, body language is a major way that dogs communicate. “Ear position, tail position, whether they are looking out the side of the eye, all of these need to be taken in context,” Parthasarathy says. “If their ears are back, their tail is down, they’re licking their lips, they are typically more worried. If they are more relaxed, then their ears are in a relaxed position, their tail is in a relaxed position.”\nDogs are smart, and some may realize that when they sigh or make a noise, you might look at them, pet them, or ask them what’s wrong. These little attention-seeking sighers might just be looking for some love and affection.\nIn some cases, a sigh could signal that yourdog is boredor frustrated. “I know my dog when he’s frustrated or has kind of given up, he gives a big sigh,” Dr. Parthasarathy says.\nOther contextual signs can usually clue you in on a frustrated or bored sigh – they might be trying to play, they might be annoyed that you stopped petting them, or they might be looking for an activity after waking up from a nap.\nIf you suspect your dog is bored and needs a little extra stimulation, consider taking them on a walk, playing, or giving them aninteractive treat or activity, like a Kong or snuffle mat.\nPet parents should look out for sighs of pain or discomfort, since these could be an indication of a larger issue. Dr. Parthasarathy recommends observing when your dog sighs to assess for signs of pain: “Does it happen more at certain times of the day versus other times of the day? Does it happen more after exercise versus not? Does it happen when they are assuming specific positions, for example, every time they transition to a laying down position?”\nYou can also observe your dog’s body language and movement for other signs of pain, such as stiffness or limited mobility. The following are some common signs of dogs in pain:\nGroaning, grunting, whining, or whimpering\nGroaning, grunting, whining, or whimpering\nChanges in daily activity or habits\nChanges in daily activity or habits\nChanges in facial expressions\nChanges in facial expressions\nAbnormal posture\nAbnormal posture\nIf you have any concerns about your dog or suspect they are in pain, consult your veterinarian.\nSighing could also just be a side effect of a dog’s breed. Brachycephalic breeds are those with shorter bone structures in the face and nose, resulting in restricted airflow through the nostrils. Since many of these breeds breath easier through the mouth than the nose, sighing may just be part of their breathing. The following are common brachycephalic breeds:\nFrench Bulldogs\nFrench Bulldogs\nEnglish Bulldogs\nEnglish Bulldogs\nBoxers\nBoxers\nBoston Terriers\nBoston Terriers\nPekingese\nPekingese\nChinese Shar-Pei\nChinese Shar-Pei\nPugs\nPugs\nLhasa Apsos\nLhasa Apsos\nShih Tzus\nShih Tzus\nBull Mastiffs\nBull Mastiffs\nGet out the toys and puzzles.\nSituational dog sighing\nOften, dog sighing is a result of a specific situation or action. These sighs could be a habit — like a human letting out an “ahh” after a sip of crisp soda — or another way that your dog is communicating with you.\nSighing while lying down is likely a sign that a dog is content and relaxed. Much like humans, it is not unusual for a dog to let out a sigh of relief once they are done moving around and have a moment to relax. However, sighing while lying down may also be a sign of discomfort, for example, among dogs with hip or joint pain, arthritis, or another mobility issue.\nDogs may sigh before sleeping to express comfort and relaxation.\nSighing during cuddling could mean your dog is content and happy. It could also mean they are squished or uncomfortable — say, a full-sized Golden Retriever squeezed into an armchair with an adult human. Sighing during cuddling could also potentially be a sign of stress or annoyance. Some dogs don’t like to have people in their personal space and will sigh to communicate that.\nDecoding the many sounds your pup makes.\nWhen is my dog’s sighing a concern?\nSighing doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong; sometimes it’s justpart of their personality. However, if a dog is excessively sighing, it could be pointing to a larger issue that requires veterinary care. Sighing likely won’t be the only symptom of a bigger problem, so look out for other signs of pain or discomfort, such as stiff movements, limping, excessive licking, or changes in behavior.\nExcessive sighing may also be a sign that your dog is bored and needs a little more stimulation in theirdaily life. Taking note of the circumstances surrounding your dog’s sighing could help you identify the reason and potential solutions. If you have any doubts or concerns, consult your vet.\nTo pet parents, awhimpering dog sounds as sad as a crying baby.

  "page_content": "Dogs tend to have some weird and gross habits: They sniff each other’s butts, they pee on top of each other’s pee, and sometimes, they like to lick each other’s ears.\nDogs lick each other's ears for several reasons. It can be a sign of affection or to show submission. It can also be a grooming or attention-seeking behavior. And some dogs may just enjoy the tastes and smells coming from another dog’s ears. Usually, dog ear-licking in moderation is fine. However, excessive licking may indicate underlying issues such as stomach problems or ear infections, warranting veterinary attention.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nUnderstanding dog behavior\nTo understand why a dog might lick another dog’s ear, it’s important to note that licking is a common dog behavior.\n“Dogs are social and for some dogs, grooming or licking is a way that they seem to bond with other dogs,” says  veterinary behaviorist Dr. Valli Parthasarathy. It starts when mothers lick their puppies to groom and comfort. As puppies get older, they often lick themselves and their littermates, which increases their bond.\nDogs may lick to groom, to experience the world through taste, to show affection, or to soothe. Licking has also been associated with a release of endorphins. Usually, licking is a harmless dog behavior. However, it may be a sign of a more serious issue if a dog is licking themselves or another dog excessively.\nAs pet parents, we often wonder what our dog is saying with certain actions and behaviors. Some dog communication methods might be obvious, like “I’m barking because the mailman is approaching the front door,” or “I’m staring at you because it’s 5:59, and you owe me dinner.” Other behaviors may be more nuanced and have a few different meanings. And sometimes, dogs are just being dogs.\nCommon dog communication methods include licking, barking, playing, and demonstrating body language such as tail andear placement.\nThey especially love to do this when they’re ignoring you.\nReasons why dogs lick each others’ ears\nLike many aspects of dog behavior, there are a few reasons a dog might like another dog’s ear, including greeting, grooming, health problems, social hierarchy, and self-soothing behavior.\nIt’s normal for dogs to lick when greeting and showing affection to bothhumans and other dogs. Ear licking as a sign of greeting or affection may be accompanied by other excitable behaviors, like tail wagging and body wiggling.\nGrooming is a normal aspect of social behavior among dogs that strengthens pack bonds. Dogs may lick each other’s ears as part of grooming because it is a hard area for dogs to reach on themselves\nLicking concentrated in a specific area may be a sign of a health concern. For example, if a dog isexcessively licking their paws, they may have environmental allergies.\nOnestudy foundthat excessive licking of surfaces among dogs was linked to gastrointestinal issues. Ear licking may also signal that the dog on the receiving end of the licks could have an ear infection. If you are concerned that your dog is licking excessively or that the ear licking is linked to a health problem, consult your veterinarian.\nIn some cases, ear licking may be an indication that one dog is submissive to the other. Usually, the submissive dog does the licking.\nLicking is a calming, self-soothing behavior for dogs. If they are licking excessively, it may be a sign that they are stressed out. For example, if your dog sitter reports that your dog is excessively licking another dog’s ears when you are out of town, that might be a sign that they have separation anxiety.\nHow does that taste, bud?\nIs dog ear licking safe?\nIn general, ear licking is not a problem, Dr. Parthasarathy says. “There’s generally nothing that’s overtly harmful from it, unless there is another dog getting irritated or that dog that’s doing the licking is licking so much that the area is raw.”\nBenefits of ear licking — and licking in general — can include stress release and increased social bonds among dogs. While not proven to be certain, it may even be healing for dogs with ear infections, Dr. Parthasarathy says: “I have clients that say, anecdotally, that they have one dog that gets ear infections and the other dog cleans out the ears and that that helps with the infection. I don’t know if there’s any research on that though.”\nEar licking can be a health concern if one dog is licking so excessively that they are causing the other dog’s ears to be raw. It can also be concerning if they are depositing any substances into the other dog’s ears (we’re looking at you,poop eaters.)\n“Goodness knows dogs are getting their mouths into everything and ears are not necessarily sterile,” Dr. Parthasarathy says. “We’re probably okay, as long as the dog who’s licking is not depositing anything into the ear, like debris or anything like that.”\nAnd when you want to draw the line attoomany kisses.\nHow to stop your dog’s ear-licking behavior\nIf your dog is licking excessively to the point where they are irritating another dog or causing a potential health issue, you may need to stop the ear-licking behavior.\nOne method to stop your dog’s ear-lick behavior is distraction. Every time they start the behavior, try redirecting their focus to something else, such as a toy or treat.\n“If they really want to lick, give them something to lick, like maybe a licking mat or something that will redirect some of that licking behavior, if it’s a self soothing behavior or anything like that,” Dr. Parthasarathy says.\nYou can also use basic training practices to teach your dog not to lick another dog. Usepositive reinforcementby rewarding them when they do what you want them to do, like coming and sitting by your side when you call them away from licking another dog’s ear.\nTheir toes might smell like Fritos, but there’s no way they tastethatgood.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nUsually, allowing your dog to lick another dog’s ears is harmless. It may be a concern if the other dog becomes irritated or any health concerns arise.\nGenerally, dog ear licking does not cause harm. However, it may be unsafe if the dog is licking the other dog’s ear raw, depositing debris in the ear, or irritating the other dog.\nTry positive training to redirect your dog’s behavior and reward them when they listen.\nReferences\nLicking\nLicking\nWhy Do Dogs Lick?\nWhy Do Dogs Lick?\nGastrointestinal Disorders in Dogs With Excessive Licking of Surfaces\nGastrointestinal Disorders in Dogs With Excessive Licking of Surfaces\n9 Signs of Stress in Dogs & Cats and How to Relieve Them\n9 Signs of Stress in Dogs & Cats and How to Relieve Them",

  "page_content": "Sometimes, it feels like our dogs are living in a different reality. They mightbark at thingswe can’t see. Or they might mightobsess over sniffingwhat seems like an inconsequential blade of grass.\nHowever, according to the concept of “umwelt” (pronounced “oom-velt”), our pets really are living in a different world from us — in a way. Umwelt holds that all animals perceive the world in unique ways, based on the signals they do (and don’t) pick up from their environment. For example, if you put a human, a bat, and a dog in the same room, each would perceive that room differently.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nTo better understand theumwelt of our dogs, we spoke to Alexandra Horowitz head of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College and author ofInside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell, and Know,a bookall about dogs’ umwelt. We also spoke with veterinary behaviorist Dr. Margaret M. Duxbury about how understanding our dogs’ umwelt can help us build a better bond with our pets.\nThe latest training activity develops your dog’s natural scenting abilities through fun and games.\nUnderstanding our dogs’ umwelt\nAs humans, sight largely dictates how we understand and navigate the world. Our senses of hearing, touch, and smell also play important roles. Dogs use the same senses but in different ways. Here are some of the biggest differences between a dog’s umwelt and our own.\nA dog’s sense of smell is truly magnificent — and it’s generally accepted as the primary sense dogs use to understand the world. “Dogs live in an olfactory world,” Horowitz says. “Odors, though, act differently than light: When we open our eyes, the world is just laid out in front of us. An olfactory creature, though, has to act — by sniffing! — and by moving their body to the odor to ‘see’ the world.”\nAccording to a2021 paper, dogs rely on smell for “gathering important information about the environment, recognizing individuals, making decisions, and learning.” Smell allows dogs togather information— both current and historical — to detect drugs, suss out illnesses, and even monitor changes in our mood.\nWhile smell is the primary way dogs navigate the world, vision is important, too. “Anyone who thinks their dog is starting at ‘nothing’ in the distance or on the ground is missing their umwelt,” says Horowitz. “They are just smelling or seeing things we can’t.”\nHorowitz notes that our dogs’ vision is different from our own in a few ways: Dogs havetwo-color vision, they are nearsighted, and they have a faster “flicker-fusion” rate, meaning their brains might notice something a split second before we do. As a result, our dogs might respond to us before we expect or notice things we don’t.\nAs humans, we primarily communicate through spoken language. While dogs vocalize as well, they heavily rely on body language for communication. InInside a Dog, Horowitz says that every gesture related to ear position, eye contact, and body posture conveys a feeling, intention, or message for dogs.\nDuxbury notes that it’s important to remember that all these senses are related and work together. Other factors, such as how dogs socialize and their cognitive abilities, also contribute to their umwelt.\nYes, dogs can see muted colors.\nHow to support your dog’s umwelt\nUnderstanding that our dog’s point of view is entirely different from our own can help pup parents overcome challenges that come with a dog living in a human-centered household, Horowitz says.\n“For us, it’s obvious that everything in the house has a role or a way it’s used: the couch to sit on, the shoe to wear,” she says. “For the dog, these roles are not defined. One is where you sit (so they may try to sit there themselves), and another smells like you (so they may want to mouth it). There are innumerable other instances.”\nRather than getting mad if your dog does something unexpected or unwanted, Duxbury recommends practicing rewards-based training and putting into place practices that align your dog's umwelt.\n“For dogs to live their best lives, they need plenty of chances to be a dog,” Duxbury says.\nConsider the following practices that take into account your dog’s umwelt and might help you build a better bond:\nAllow your dog to sniff on walks: “Dogs need a chance to amble and actually spend two minutes sniffing a blade of grass,” Duxbury adds. Instead of rushing through walks, let your dog sniff at their leisure.\nAllow your dog to sniff on walks: “Dogs need a chance to amble and actually spend two minutes sniffing a blade of grass,” Duxbury adds.

Followsafe socialization practicesto make sure your dog grows up happy and comfortable in various environments.\nDon’t undervalue socialization: Duxbury notes that the first few months of your dog’s life during the socialization period are key. “The dog’s brain learns what’s seen as normal and usual versus what’s threatening,” she says. Followsafe socialization practicesto make sure your dog grows up happy and comfortable in various environments.\nDifferent umwelts, one connection\nLiving your life according to someone else’s rules and schedules isn’t always fun or easy. The same goes for our dogs. “Just thinking about the challenge of being a dog whose day is dictated by someone else — they have to wait for us to eat, to pee, to socialize, etc — made me much more compassionate about letting my dogs make their own choices, and try to be more in touch with their actual needs (not just what one might assume dogs need),” Horowitz says.\nLike any worthwhile relationship, it may take some work to better understand your dog’s point of view. But for Duxbury, the work that goes into building a bond with our dogs is worth it: “What a gift it is to have that interspecies connection,” she says.\nReferences:\nThe Umwelt\nThe Umwelt\nInformation and the Umwelt: A Theoretical Framework for the Evolution of Play\nInformation and the Umwelt: A Theoretical Framework for the Evolution of Play\nEpisode 556: It’s a Dog’s Umwelt ft Alexandra Horowitz\nEpisode 556: It’s a Dog’s Umwelt ft Alexandra Horowitz\nInside of a Dog\nInside of a Dog\nAn Immense World dives deep into the umwelt of animals\nAn Immense World dives deep into the umwelt of animals",

    "title": "Does Your Dog Fixate on Other Dogs? Here’s How to Get Them to Walk Away",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/dog-fixating-on-another-dog"
  },
  "page_content": "Every dog owner has experienced this: you’re walking your dog and as you approach another person walking their dog, your pup stops. Their body goes rigid and they stare at the other dog with an intensity that only a dog can muster. It's as if everything around them has melted away and all that exists in the universe is the two of them. Sometimes a word from you is all it takes to break their focus and move them along, but other times, especially when the other dog is staring back, getting your pup to disengage can be a real challenge. And failing to do so can have disastrous consequences.\n“Intense eye contact for dogs is very confrontational and can lead to aggression,” says Annie-Mae Levy, adog trainer at Woofzwith a BS in animal behavior. “That’s why it is so important to have a plan in place, because once your dog fixates, things can escalate quickly — from barking, to lunging, to a full-blown fight.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhy do dogs fixate on each other?\nDogs fixate on each other for a number of reasons, many of them completely benign. They might want to play or find themselves with a lot of pent-up energy they don’t know what to do with. They could be curious about this other dog, or anticipating a greeting or some other form of interaction.\nYounger dogs might not yet know how to read the body language of other dogs, so they might fixate while trying to figure a new dog out.\n“The breed also plays a role,” says Levy. “Herding or hunting dogs, for example, may ‘lock on’ to things more easily.”\nTwo animal behavior experts agree it’s usuallyplay fighting. Here’s how you can tell.\n“Dogs also fixate when they are getting ready to defend themselves,” says Sally Grotini, a certified trainer of service and therapy dogs and dog behavior expert atJustAnswer. “They may also have a possessive aggressive temperament or be possessive of their human.” It’s also possible they have a naturally fearful temperament, which causes them to fixate more easily. These fear-based fixations are the ones most likely to lead to a fight, because even if your dog isn’t particularly aggressive or possessive, the dog they are fixating on might be. And it only takes one dog to start a fight.\nWhat should you do if you notice your dog fixating?\nFirst and foremost, don’t yank the leash. “Yanking the leash can actually cause the dog to act out faster,” says Grottini. “If a dog is fixed on a fight, yanking on the dog can put them in motion to do so.”\nLevy agrees. “Yanking on the leash might seem like a quick fix, but it can actually make things worse. It can even lead to the dog associating the discomfort they feel at being yanked with the other dog, which could make them even more reactive next time.”\nYanking on your dog’s leash can also hurt your dog’s neck, and saving your dog from getting hurt is the whole point of breaking their fixation in the first place.\nInstead, try blocking your dog’s view of the other dog. This can be as simple as slowly walking in front of your dog and then leading them away, as shown inthis Instagram reel from South End Dog Training. If that doesn’t work, try getting down on the dog’s level and fully blocking their view of the other dog. This should be enough to distract them to the point where you can redirect them away from the object of their fixation. If all else fails, you can use gentle pressure to move them along, but, again, don’t yank them. Use your hands to gently direct them where you want to go.\nGrottini also recommends keeping a favorite toy or high-value treat like chicken slivers in your pocket that you can pull out if your dog doesn’t want to give you their attention.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nAlternately, you may just need to walk your dog in a less crowded area, where there are fewer dogs for them to fixate on.\nCan you train your dog not to fixate in the first place?\nWhile you can’t train fixation behavior out of your dog entirely, you can train them to drop their fixation and return their attention to you.\nLevy recommends starting with a “look at me” command. Teach your dog the command at home, away from other dogs. Once the command is perfected, take them to a location where other dogs are present, but far away, and train the command again. Over time, you can move closer to the other dogs. Reinforce their behavior by rewarding them every time they glance at another dog and then return their attention to you. “It’s like building a habit,” says Levy. “They need to learn that it is rewarding to glance at things and then back at you.”\nGrottini recommends a similar command: “leave it,” which, when properly trained, can be used to get a dog to drop any fixation, whether it is another dog, a person, a car, or a piece of food on the sidewalk. “Many people do not train this command long enough as it should be trained for at least six months and trained with all sorts of items, people, other dogs, cars, etc. Anything you think the dog will encounter; this command should be taught around,” says Grottini.\nWhat if you notice another dog fixating on your dog?\nThere is no predicting or controlling what another person’s dog will do. Try to stop your own dog from staring back — using treats, a clicker, or well-trained commands like the ones discussed above — and then put some distance between both dogs.\n“It’s also important to stay calm and not overreact,” says Levy. “Because your dog is going to take cues from your behavior.”\nAt what point should you seek help from a trainer?\nTraining dogs is hard. Especially when you are trying to train them out of a reactive behavior like fixation. For this reason, both Grottini and Levy recommend seeking professional help sooner, rather than later. “If your dog’s fixations are constant and it’s leading to reactive or aggressive behavior, it’s time to get help from a professional trainer,” says Levy. “They can figure out if your dog is acting out of fear or excitement, or something else, and give you a solid idea on how to manage it.” They can help you practice commands and make sure you have all the tools you need to keep your dog and yourself safe.",

  "page_content": "If there’s one thing that can get dog people and cat people to see eye to eye, it’s a cat-like dog. Recently, these best-of-both-worlds pets have taken the internet by storm, with TikTok users sharing videos of their pups acting decidedly un-doglike.“Do you want to see what a Pit Bull raised by cats looks like?” one user asked over a video of their pup. In a series of clips, the Pit Bull lounges in a loaf, rubs his side against his pet parent’s legs, and curls up next to a kitty. In another video, a Golden Retriever “raised by a cat” perches on the highest part of a couch, play-fights by lifting his paws high in the air, and sits in the windowsill. “I’m not a scientist but I think your dog is the equivalent of bilingual in the dog and cat world,” one TikTok user commented.\nSo… are dogs raised by cats really more cat-like?\nAccording to cat behaviorist Dr. Mikel Delgado, people may be reading a little too much into their pups’ habits — however adorable they might be. “The behaviors in question are not out of the range of ordinary dog behaviors,” Dr. Delgado says. “Dogs will loaf … they are naturally hunters who stalk and watch prey, so these behaviors are not necessarily due to living with a cat. I think people naturally tend to be drawn to similarities and think they are something more than coincidence.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nIn fact, animals aren’t reallyteachingeach other all that much, Dr. Delgado says. According toa book calledAnimal Cognition: Evolution, Behavior and Cognitionby Clive D.L. Wynne and Monique A. R. Udell, the definition of teaching in the animal kingdom “has specific criteria,” Dr. Delgado explains. “The ‘teacher’ modifies their behavior for the benefit of their pupil, and the pupil learns a behavior they would not otherwise.”\nCats, in particular, are unlikely to be intentionally teaching another animal (who’s not their kin) anything. “Cats don’t naturally care for their young past a few months of age,” Dr. Delgado says. “Especially in spayed/neutered pets, there’s no reason to think caretaking behavior similar to raising young would continue or be transferred to another species.”\nThat said, animals can pick up on the behaviors of other animals around them. For example,one studypublished inRoyal Society Open Sciencefound that dogs mimic the expressions and motions of other dogs they meet. “Animals certainly show signs of social learning (learning due to the presence of the other animal) but this does not mean there is deliberate teaching or imitation happening,” Dr. Delgado says.\nSo, while Dr. Delgado cautions against assuming that animals are teaching each other new behaviors, it’s totally possible that our pets are picking up each other’s habits purely by accident through bonding. Whatever the case, the resident pet should take it as a compliment: Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, after all.",

  "page_content": "Tail-chasing in puppies is often a normal, playful behavior stemming from curiosity about their own bodies and a desire for entertainment. However, while tail-chasing can be harmless, excessive tail-chasing may signal underlying issues, such as boredom, anxiety, or even medical conditions.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nNormal reasons for a puppy chasing their tail\nPuppies are extremely playful and everything is new to them; they explore everything. They are also beginning to learn about their environment and their bodies. Typically, a puppy who is just learning about their body will chase their tail because it’s fun.\nWhen puppies are bored, they will get into anything and everything. Puppies are known to get into trouble when they have too much energy and no outlet to get it out. If your puppy is chasing their tail, they may be trying to entertain themselves while trying to shake out their sillies. It may be time to break out a toy or take your puppy on a walk where they get to sniff around.\nPuppies can learn from positive reactions and how you respond to a behavior. When you ask your puppy to sit, then you pet them and say, “Good dog.” Over time, they learn that “sit” was reinforced and will continue to do that. The same goes for chasing their tail. If your puppy chases their tail and you laugh and get excited, they may continue to do that behavior because it was reinforced. If you continue to respond in a way that excites your puppy when they chase their tail, they may be reinforced to continue doing that behavior.\nChasing their tails, eating grass, and rolling in garbage — should you worry?\nMedical reasons for a puppy chasing their tail\nUnfortunately, certain medical causes can be a reason your puppy is chasing their tail. If you notice that your puppy is chasing or biting at their tail more often or that it no longer looks like a fun game, there may be a medical cause and treatment may be warranted. This can include the following:\nIf yourdog has fleas, you may notice certain behavior changes. Fleas bite your dog’s skin, causing irritation which causes itchiness. As your puppy tries to scratch the itch, you may notice them chasing their tail or biting at their tail or skin. You must treat your dog right away if you notice signs of fleas. Fleas can be transferred to humans or furniture (though the latter is not an adequate host).\nA fishy odor is the typical red flag for anal gland issues. Anal glands are what gets released in your dog’s rectum they have a normal bowel movement. If you notice your dog scooting or biting or chasing their tail area, they may haveimpacted anal glands. Some do have a chronic issue with this, while for others, it may happen on occasion, such as after a bought of diarrhea, when the anal glands were not properly expressed.\nCertain neurological issues can be the cause of your dog’s tail-chasing. If you feel that the tail-chasing behavior has become severe, your dog may have an underlying cause as to why they are doing this behavior. Severe tail-chasing has been seen as a result of epilepsy in dogs.\nA veton what to do when “anal sacs go bad.”\nBehavioral reasons for a puppy chasing their tail\nPuppies can suffer fromanxiety and stress, similar to humans. Anxiety or stress in puppies can be caused by a variety of reasons and can have varying degrees of severity. As a coping mechanism, your dog may chase their tail to find relief from the stressful or anxious situation. If you believe your puppy is suffering from anxiety or stress, it’s important to seek the assistance of a trainer or veterinarian to help ease these issues.\nCompulsive behaviors are normal behaviors that happen in extreme repetition. They may seem borderline frantic, considering the number of times they happen. Dogs can develop behaviors that indicate obsessive compulsive disorder, (OCD) and these behaviors may impact their ability to function. They may be unable to stop themselves from doing these compulsive actions. To address this issue, you may need to make behavior or environmental changes to help your dog from suffering from compulsive behaviors.\nIf your puppy is suffering from a severe lack of stimulation, you may notice them doing certain repetitive behaviors, one of which may be tail-chasing. If the lack of stimulation is severe enough, it can lead todepression in dogs. When bringing a new puppy into your home, it is always important to research your breed to make sure that you will be able to fulfill their needs.\nWhile tail-chasing can be fun and games, it’s important to be able to tell the difference between a fun or a serious issue. Always consult a veterinarian if you have any concerns about your pup.\nMany pet parents share information at the dog park, but is the information always accurate?\nFAQs (People also ask):\nIt comes down to how often your puppy is chasing their tail and if you can distract them from it.\nIf your puppy is chasing their tail frequently, and you cannot distract them with a toy, treat, or something else they enjoy, then this may be a compulsive behavior, and it would be best to seek the help of a veterinarian.\nIf you notice yourpuppy scooting, this usually means they are having difficulty releasing their anal glands, and they are trying to find a way to excrete them. If this is a frequent occurrence, your vet can train you how to release your dog’s anal glands at home.

  "page_content": "The length of time a puppy can be left alone largely depends on their age. As a general rule, puppies may be able to be left alone for one hour per month of age (up to eight to 10 hours max for adult dogs). However, temperament, training, and preparation play huge roles in successful alone time.\nNewborn puppies need frequent care, feeding, and supervision. This is usually managed by their mom, but orphaned puppies will need someone to support them through their first weeks of life. This involves feeding every couple of hours, managing their environment, and stimulating urination and defecation. Bottle-raising a puppy is a round-the-clock job, but it can be rewarding if you’re able to put in the work.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nPuppies are usually first adopted when they’re a little more independent, at around eight to twelve weeks of age. These young pups still need a lot of care and supervision but can handle a little more time on their own, especially if it’s introduced gradually. After the initial introduction and excitement of adopting a puppy has worn off, you may wonder, “When can I leave my puppy home alone?” After all, you can’t live off Uber Eats forever.\nAge-based guidelines for leaving puppies alone\nAdding a puppy to your home can feel like a new chapter in your life. As much as you’d love to spend every second of the day with them by your side, there will be times when you need to be apart. But how long can you leave a puppy alone?\nEvery puppy is different, but a general rule of thumb that people use says that you can leave a puppy alone for a number of hours equal to their age in months, up to eight to ten hours. Many factors come into play with this: house training, food or medication needs, crate training, and anxiety, to name a few. It’s important to recognize that every puppy is going to adjust to a new home at their own pace and not rush things based on an expectation that may not fit their needs.\nHow long can puppies be left alone in a crate?\nPuppies can spend their time alone in a crate to make sure they’re in a space where they can’t cause trouble or get injured. Getting your puppy started oncrate trainingearly can greatly improve both of your lives. The goal is to get your puppy to see the crate as a safe place where they can rest, not as a place they go when they’re being punished. Creating positive associations with the crate takes time and patience.\nThe way to help your puppy getcomfortable with their crateis simple: Give lots of treats and lots of positive attention. Get them interested in the crate by putting food or treats inside for them to discover. Let them explore the space without closing the door or making a big deal out of it, so they associate it with only positive things.\nAs they’re getting comfortable with the crate, you can begin feeding them in there. Try leaving the room and coming back while they’re in the crate to introduce them to the idea of you leaving. Eventually, you can begin closing the door for short periods and gradually lengthening the time apart.\nSome puppies can be very difficult to get acclimated to a crate, but it’s still important to keep your puppy confined to an area where they can’t get into trouble while you’re gone. Try out alternatives like apuppy pen, cordoning off areas with baby gates, or finding a bare room where they’re comfortable resting. Again, introduce changes slowly and find out what works for your puppy.\nPotty training is a big part of leaving your puppy alone. No one wants to come home tofind accidents in the house. Always take your puppy outside to potty before you leave them alone. In their first months of life, puppies can usually hold their pee for only two to three hours. They’ll be able to stretch this time as they grow, but it’s a good idea to not push their boundaries. Good potty training relies on setting a pattern of expected trips outsidebeforeyour puppy needs to pee.\nExpect that accidents will happen, especially in your first weeks together. It’s important to not get angry or punish your puppy for peeing or pooping in the house. They won’t understand or make the connection you’re hoping for, and they’ll just learn to be afraid of you. Instead, clean up the mess and promise to get your puppy outside earlier next time.\nNot that you want to be away from them anyway.\nSeparation anxiety in puppies\nAlmost all puppies are going to whine, bark, or show some evidence of being upset when they’re first left alone. This is normal behavior and doesn’t mean that your puppy hasseparation anxietyand will never adjust to being on their own. Most will gradually reduce their complaints as they adjust to the routine, but some may stay abnormally anxious throughout the time away from their parents.\nIf you suspect your puppy isn’t settling down after you’re gone, set up a video camera to record them so you can see what behaviors they’re exhibiting and for how long. Symptoms of separation anxiety in dogs can include:\nVocalization (whining, barking, howling)\nVocalization (whining, barking, howling)\nTrembling\nTrembling\nDestructive behaviors\nDestructive behaviors\nUrination or defecation\nUrination or defecation\nRestlessness\nRestlessness\nSalivation\nSalivation\nClinginess\nClinginess\nThese behaviors may show up when you’re preparing to leave or while you’re gone. If you’re concerned about separation anxiety in your puppy, talk with your vet or a veterinary behaviorist.Behavioral therapyand medications can help dogs get over this harmful behavior.\nYoung puppies can develop separation anxiety or separation-related distress. There’s no minimum age, but it often first appears when puppies are three to four months old and just starting to be left on their own in a new home.\nWith training, conditioning, and sometimes medication, puppies can get over separation anxiety. If you’re concerned about separation anxiety in your puppy, talk to your vet early. It’s best to start strategies to break the cycle of anxiety before they become long-term issues. Don’t just assume your puppy will grow out of it on their own.\nDon’t hit pause on your pet’s playtime – these solo activities will help 9-5 fly by for them.\nHow to leave a puppy home alone\nIt’s a sad fact of life that most pet parents need to work so they can get their new puppy toys, food, vet care, plush beds, and trips to the groomer. Figuring out how to leave a puppy home alone while at work can be a challenge, especially early on. Start off with a short time (especially when your puppy is small) and work up gradually as your puppy grows. Some care strategies for leaving your puppy home when you’re away include:\nPuppies are mischievous and may try to play with or destroy anything they can find. Make sure their space doesn’t have access totoxic plantsorfoods, is away from stairs or high surfaces, and is free of electrical cords or other dangers. Restricting your puppy to a crate, pen, orsmall roomis the best way to keep them out of trouble.\nSome puppies may appreciate a radio or TV playing something calming to provide some noise and distraction.Indestructible toys(sometimes with a difficult-to-access treat hidden within) can provide an opportunity for play and stimulation as well.\nUsing a video monitor can help you keep track of how your puppy is handling their alone time. You can see what they’re interested in doing while you’re away and adjust their environment to help keep them occupied while you’re gone. The hope is that your puppy will spend most of your time apart sleeping or relaxing.\nYour puppy training schedule, from eight weeks to six months. Let’s do this.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nStrategies for keeping puppies relaxed when left home alone include providing a safe, familiar environment, using a pheromone collar toreduce stress, and using positive reinforcement to introduce them to the idea that being alone is OK.\nThere are many ways toprovide distractionsfor your puppy while you’re away, including treat puzzles, indestructible toys, and activity stations.

And yet, the more you obsessively stare at your adorable sleeping puppy, the more you may notice things that have you asking, is thatnormal?\nUntilyou have a puppy of your own, you may not have spent much time observing the sleep habits of puppies or any dogs for that matter. It may come as a surprise to see all the different puppy sleep phases. The good news is that most puppies have predictable sleep patterns and changes in their breathing are typically a normal part of their sleep cycle.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nDepending on the age of your puppy, their breathing rate may also be faster than adult dogs even when they are awake, so keep that in mind if you are comparing your puppy to an older dog. Read on to learn more about normal breathing patterns in puppies.\nIs it normal for puppies to breathe fast while sleeping?\nYes, the good news is that most of the time, it is perfectly normal for a puppy to breathe fast while sleeping. This is because their respiratory rate — or the number of breaths they take per minute — changes during different phases of sleep, and some stages of sleep are more active than others.\nYou should notice that your puppy’s breathing shifts during a long nap or overnight sleep from rapid breathing into slower breathing at different times, but if you are also sleeping, you may not catch all of these phases. Another reason your puppy may appear to be breathing fast while sleeping, especially if you are comparing your puppy’s breathing to an adult dog, is that younger puppies generally have a faster respiratory rate than dogs over six months old.\nDogs twitch in their sleep for many reasons.\nDo puppies have REM sleep?\nYes, puppies and dogs of all ages have REM sleep just like humans. REM sleep stands for rapid eye movement sleep, and defines an active phase of sleep where the eyes move back and forth rapidly within the eyelids. This phase of sleep is also characterized by more active brain activity which maylead to dreamingor twitching.\nREM sleep tends to occur later in the sleep cycle and is preceded by non-REM sleep, which includes drowsiness, and slow wave sleep, also known as the deep-sleep phase. These different phases of the sleep cycle last from just a few minutes up to a few hours so in a typical night’s sleep, puppies cycle through all of these different phases multiple times. Young puppies, just like human babies, spend more of their sleep cycle in REM sleep. As they get older, REM cycles tend to become shorter. It is during their REM sleep that you are more likely to notice shallow or rapid breathing. This also explains why younger puppies tend to have more episodes of rapid breathing during their sleep cycle than older dogs, because they are spending more time in the REM phase.\nDogs need more sleep than humans. Here’s how much is healthy.\nReasons why your puppy breathes fast\nThe most likely explanations for a puppy breathing rapidly while sleeping are that either this is their normal respiratory rate, and it is just faster than an adult dog’s, or that they are in a more active phase of the sleep cycle.\nThere are certainly other reasons for a puppy to be breathing rapidly, and it is important to seek veterinary attention right away if you believe your puppy’s breathing is abnormal. A dog that is having a breathing problem will show signs when they are awake as well as when they are asleep; monitor your dog when they are awake, too, and see if you notice anything that seems off.\nTo gauge whether your puppy’s breathing is normal, you can count their resting respiratory rate. This meanscounting your puppy’s breaths per minutewhen they are awake but resting quietly. This should be a nice, slow, rhythmic pattern. If their breathing is shallow, rapid, or labored even when they are just resting quietly, that is an indication of a problem. Be sure to do this when they are truly at rest and not right after play, exercise, or other causes of excitement. Some explanations for rapid breathing include:\nDreaming is part of the REM cycleof sleep when dogs may have an increased rate of breathing along with more shallow breaths, twitching, or vocalizing. This is perfectly normal, adorable, and should stop once they enter the phase of deep sleep, or if they are awakened.\nDogs pant to cool offand this requires a rapid passage of air through the respiratory system. If the ambient temperatures are very warm, your dog will continue to breathe quickly even at rest or when asleep to try to stay cool.\nExercise, play, and other excitement will increase both their heart rate and respiratory rate. It also may result in a temporary increase in body temperature, requiring them to pant to cool off. All of this can result in rapid breathing. Their breathing should return to a slower rate once they have had adequate time to settle down. Usually if they are calm enough to fall asleep, their breathing will also have returned to a slower rate.\nSituations that cause excitement, anxiety, or fear can also increase a dog’s heart rate and breathing rate and may also result in panting. This is part of their flight or fight response. Once again,if they have calmed downenough to rest and fall asleep, their breathing rate should also return to a slower pattern.\nPain can stimulate the body to have an increased heart rate and breathing rate.Dogs who are in painmay also hide, avoid affection, growl protectively, have a decreased appetite, or other signs of their injury, like a limp.\nSometimes, an underlying heart or lung problem can affect a dog’s breathing and may result in rapid breathing, labored breathing, or even a cough. Some congenital conditions that puppies can be born with are heart malformations, diaphragmatic hernias, or cleft palates, all of which may result in breathing abnormalities. They can also be susceptible to certain infectious diseases like kennel cough, which more recently has become known ascanine infectious respiratory disease complex(CIRDC), which can cause cold-like symptoms, coughs, or even pneumonia.\nAnemia is a lack of red blood cells in circulation. This can bedue to bleeding, such as after a traumatic injury or ingesting toxins like rodenticide. Anemia may also be the result of certain infectious diseases liketick-borne diseasesor fleas. Finally, anemia can be caused by a lack of production of red blood cells due to a problem with the bone marrow.\nRegardless of the underlying cause, anemic dogs will have pale gums, be very weak, and often have rapid breathing as they try to compensate for the lack of red blood cells delivering oxygen to their body. This is a medical emergency and should be treated by a veterinarian right away.\nBreeds that are known for their smushed face look including French Bulldogs, American Bulldogs, Pugs, Pekingese, and Shih Tzus have anatomical changes in their bone structure as well as in their airways, which are collectively known asbrachycephalic syndrome. These dogs may have difficulty breathing even at rest, are more likely to snore, and are vulnerable to respiratory distress and overheating after exercise and in hot weather. Any sudden changes in their breathing should be evaluated by a vet right away as they can get worse quickly without medical attention.\nDon’t panic, but definitely talk to your vet if you’re worried about any of these conditions.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nTwitching during sleepis almost always associated with the REM sleep phase. As long as the twitching stops when they are awake or in other phases of sleep, it is nothing to worry about.\nHeavy breathing can have many causes. Some are considered normal within a reasonable range, such as during exercise, or periods of excitement or fear. Other times, this can be a sign of a serious underlying problem. Checking your dog’s resting respiratory rate can be a helpful way to distinguish these causes. An adult dog who is calm, quiet, and resting should have a steady, consistent respiratory rate of less than 30 breaths per minute. If you know what your dog’s typical resting rates are, and they are suddenly trending much higher, you’ll know you need to seek medical care for your pup.\nReferences:\nAnimals: Sleep Duration and Behaviours: A Descriptive Analysis of a Cohort of Dogs up to 12 Months of Age\nAnimals: Sleep Duration and Behaviours: A Descriptive Analysis of a Cohort of Dogs up to 12 Months of Age\nCurrent Opinion in Behavioral Sciences: Sleep in the Dog: Comparative, Behavioral and Translational Relevance\nCurrent Opinion in Behavioral Sciences: Sleep in the Dog: Comparative, Behavioral and Translational Relevance\nScience Reports: The Interrelated Effect of Sleep and Learning in Dogs (\nScience Reports: The Interrelated Effect of Sleep and Learning in Dogs (\nThe Veterinary Journal: How Does Multilevel Upper Airway Surgery Influence the Lives of Dogs with Severe brachycephaly?

Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhy do dogs scratch their beds?\nThe adorable pup living in your home has evolved from wolves and wild dogs. Because of this, they may still act upon some of the traits and behaviors of their ancestors. You may notice your dog scratching their bed, which helps them get comfortable. Wild dogs and wolves will scratch to make a cozy nest for resting or to settle down for the night just like your dog may. Another instinctual reason a mother dog may dig an area or bed is that they aregoing into labor, and they are preparing the area to have their litter of puppies.\nDogsloveto leave their mark. Dog scent can relay many messages to other dogs. Scent can tell another dog about gender, health status, if they are fixed, and age. Dogs can gather a lot of information about other dogs just from their scent.\nDog paws have scent glands in them, these glands allow them to leave a trail of their scent wherever they go. Scratching is a way to spread that scent in an area, while the dog is scratching debris may go flying through the air spreading their scent even further. Your dog may scratch to leave a message that tells other dogs they were there.\nScratching may be a way your dog de-stresses; it is a self-soothing behavior. Similar to how a human may take deep breaths or use other methods to help destress, your dog may find relief from scratching. Depending on the amount your dog does this, it may be important to take your dog to the vet to help treat them for their anxiety or stress. When a behavior is interfering in your dog's life, it is important to have the issues addressed by a professional.\nMost dogs understand the assignment when it comes to getting comfortable. Your dog may scratch to make a cozy spot for themselves. This can mean scratching to move the pillows or the blankets or just scratching at the area they want to lay on to help make their bed extra comfy. A dog may also use scratching to help them make a comfortable spot on a hot day. Dogs will dig to get to cooler ground where the dirt may feel damp, to help them cool off on a hot day.\nWhat’s behind the desire and whether it’s safe to do.\nHow to protect your dog’s bed from scratching\nTrimming your dog’s nails to an appropriate length is important for many reasons. When dogs have nails that are too long, it can be a hazard to their health. If your dog loves scratching their bed, having long nails can also be a hazard to their bed. Trimming your dog’s nails often can help keep them comfortable with getting theirnails trimmed, and may save their bed from unnecessary holes. Using positive reinforcement and treats while trimming your dog’s nails can also help them tolerate their manicures. Scratch boards exist that can help you file your dog’s nails while fulfilling their want to dig.\nLiving with stress and anxiety can be detrimental to your dog’s health. If your dog’sstress and anxietyare affecting their daily life, you should seek the assistance of a veterinarian to help treat your dog so that they can live a comfortable life. You may also want to enlist the help of a trainer to work with you and your dog to help over come any fears that may be causing the anxiety or stress.\nScratch-proof beds are a great resource for dog parents who have dogs that love to scratch and, over time, wear away at their beds, causing holes. Scratch-proof beds are available for purchase and may help you extend the life of your dog’s bed. They may prevent you from having to replace the bed over and over due to holes from your dog’s scratching.\nDepending on the size and strength of your dog and how hard they move their little paws and nails against the fabric, you can save yourself time and money by purchasing a scratch-proof bed. These beds may be more expensive, but many also have a lifetime guarantee, preventing you from having to buy a dog bed over and over.\nIt’s a personal preference, but here are the pros and cons.\nIs it bad for dogs to scratch their beds?\nThis is a normal behavior that dogs do. If your dog does this behavior to get comfortable, cool off, mark an area, or while they are in labor, this is perfectly fine.\nAs with all behaviors, there is normal, and then there is abnormal. If you find that this is a compulsive behavior that happens over and over to the point of obsession, and you cannot distract or stop your dog from the behavior, this is a cause for alarm. If your dog is scratching to the point of making themselves bleed, this would be another cause for alarm. In this case, contact your vet immediately.\nDogs need more sleep than humans.

Normal reasons your dog may scratch or dig at their bed include for their comfort, to mark their scent, to regulate their body temperature, or if they are in labor. Some reasons your dog may scratch that are a cause for concern include anxiety, stress, or a compulsive behavior.\nInterrupting your dog by calling their name or gently asking them to stop can prevent your dog from scratching their bed. You can also give your dog appropriate outlets to dig, like in a sandbox that you make for them. Sometimes, fulfilling a behavior appropriately may prevent it from happening somewhere that you do not want it to happen. If you cannot interrupt your dog from doing this behavior, or if it is affecting their daily life, it’s important to contact your vet.\nChoosing the right bed for your dogwho is a scratcher could help prevent you from having to replace the bed due to damage.

  "page_content": "Few nights of the year torture my anxious dog more than Halloween. A nervous creature already prone to barking at the faintest noise in our apartment hallway, for her, this holiday is basically an overstuffed candy bag full of triggers. She hates the foot traffic. She never gets used to the constantly ringing doorbell. And don’t even get herstartedon the crowds outside when we take her downstairs for her last walk of the night.\n“Imagine going for your usual morning walk and suddenly seeing a 30-foot blow-up cat in a yard that wasn’t there yesterday, without having any concept or understanding of Halloween,” Kristi Jones certified dog trainer and owner Mind Your Manners Pet Training, LLC, says. “It’s no wonder dogs can be on edge.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhat’s a sympathetic pet parent to do?\nNo matter the issue, there’s a lot we can do to help prepare our dogs for the big night. I asked two experts — Jones and Kirsten Kraljevic, a professional dog trainer with 35 years of experience — to give me the rundown of everything dogs hate about Halloween, and how best to help them.\nAKA a night that won’t turn into a scary time at the emergency vet.\nThings your dog hates about Halloween\nStrange objects can be scary — especially if they move, light up, or make noise. To help your dog deal, Jones recommends letting them watch you set everything up. “If you have motion-activated decor, inside or outside, turn off the motion detector when not in use so your dog isn’t startled every time they just try to walk to the water bowl or go outside,” Jones says. Let your dogs check out any new objects on their own terms.\nAnd as for all of the spooky lawn decorations around the neighborhood? Don’t force your dogs to interact with anything they don’t seem to like; instead, let them investigate new objects during walks on their own terms wherever it’s safe to do so. Jones recommends giving curious dogs about five to 10 seconds to check out new sights. “After about 10 seconds, if they aren’t ready to move on themselves, they may be mentally stuck, like a deer caught in headlights, and guiding them away with a treat may be helpful,” she says.\nIf your dog is accustomed to long, quiet walks and isafraid of kids, Halloween is rough. Try walking your dog or taking them out to play earlier in the day, before all the superheroes and movie monsters take to the streets. As Kraljevic puts it, “A tired dog is often a calmer dog.”\nThis isn’t just about keeping your dog calm; it’s also about safety. Even ifthey’re microchipped,Jones recommends keeping your dog’s collar on with a tag or even some painters tape with their name and your contact information. Make sure the contact information on both their tag and microchip is up to date and keep a current photo on hand in case they get lost. As Jones points out, “A picture showing a shaggy dog isn’t very helpful if they’ve just been shaved at the groomer.”\nWhile walking outside during and after Halloween, keep an eye out for stray candy. Jones warns that sugar-free candies and chewing gum contain Xylotol, also known as birch sugar, which, like chocolate, is highly toxic to dogs. If your dog eats any of these sweet treats, consult with your veterinarian or call theASPCA poison control hotline.\nScarier thanHalloween Kills.\nEven the most calm and sociable dogs might find themselves stressed on Halloween night. “Constant foot traffic and strangers coming to the door can make dogs feel like their territory is being invaded, leading to protective or fearful behavior,” Kraljevic says. To your dog, the stranger danger is real.\nThis holiday is the second-most prolific day (following the Fourth of July) of the year for lost pets for a reason, Joan says: “Even pets who are usually very friendly with people can get spooked by kids who don’t look or act as they normally do, and sometimes, they may bolt out of the door and become disoriented and scared very quickly.” That’s why it’s crucial to keep their collar and tags on at all times.\nIf repeated doorbell ringing makes your dog anxious, take steps before and after the actual night of Halloween to help them cope.\nBefore the big day, try teaching your dog some door etiquette by asking a friend or relative to ring the doorbell while you reward your dog for staying calm or retreating to a quiet place, Kraljevic says. And on actual Halloween night, Jones recommends setting up a quiet spot or room in the house with familiar bedding and lots of toys. Leave a noisy distraction like the TV or radio on to mask the unfamiliar sounds of the night.\nDepending on how bad your dog’s doorbell fear is, you might also consider sitting outside to greet trick-or-treaters and pre-empt the doorbell, weather permitting. As an alternative, Jones suggests keeping an eye out for approaching trick-or-treaters so you can open the door for them before they ring the bell.\nIn terms of noise, it’s not just the doorbell you have to worry about. From fireworks, to electronic decorations, to nearby house parties, Halloween spawns all sorts of sounds that can make a dog nervous. Just like with the doorbell, this approach can help to create a comfy, cozy, peaceful spot where your dog can ride out the night.\nWhatever you do, both experts advise against leaving your dog outside unattended or off leash, even in a fenced yard. Sounds like fireworks can cause them to panic and run away, even by digging under a fence. Plus, Jones points out, “people can enjoy playing pranks and you don’t want your dog to be a target of some trickster with less than good intentions.”\nFireworks and thunderstorms aren’t the only things that make them say,“No, thanks!”\nYour Morticia Addams costume might slay, but sadly, your dogs won’t get the reference. In fact, there’s a good chance that the sight of you in a long wig and unfamiliar clothes might just freak them out. The solution? It’s time for a “get ready with me” (GRWM) sesh.\n“I always suggest that people let their dogs see them dress up or dress up in stages,” Jones says. “Don’t just suddenly pop out in full costume.”\nKraljevic echoes this suggestion and adds that it can also be helpful to reward dogs for “calm exploratory behavior” while they check out your weird outfit. Just don’t take it personally if they don’t give you the compliments you deserve.\nIf seeingyouin weird clothes might freak your dog out, there’s a non-zero chance that they don’t want to wear a costume, either.\n“While we find dogs dressed in costumes cute and fun, many dogs are very uncomfortable with wearing clothes,” Jones says. “If you really want to dress them up, make sure that costumes do not restrict their movement or their breathing at all, or have pieces that can be chewed off easily. Get them acclimated to wearing the costume gradually, using lots of treats.”\nWe all want our dog to win Best Dressed at the office Halloween party, but no prize is worth making them miserable.\nHumans love shiny objects, but your dog might not be as wild about the light-up decorations, the glow sticks, and the flashlights that can go hand-in-hand with Halloween. Ahead of the holiday, Kraljevic recommends trying desensitization training to help lessen your dog’s stress around whatever triggers might set them off.\n“Ideally you would start desensitization training for Halloween way ahead of Halloween,” Kraljevic says. “Desensitization training relies on Halloween-related stimuli being introduced gradually, taking weeks if not months.”\nWhatever the flashy thing might be, introduce it to your dog slowly and offer plenty of treats and praise for neutral or happy responses.\nHave we gone too far with this Halloween dog costume thing?\nLike many of us, dogs are creatures of habit, so any shift in their usual routines, like eating and walking times, can create stress, Kraljevic says. Try to keep your activities as ordinary as possible and minimize disruptions.\nIf your dog appears stressed, Jones advises that activities like licking, chewing, and sniffing can help reduce stress hormones. She recommends distractors like long-acting chews to help them calm down after stressful events. Kraljevic also suggests enrichment activities like puzzle toys to keep their attention occupied.\nKeep your responses soothing but not over-the-top; making too much of a fuss about your dog’s anxiety can unintentionally reinforce it, Kraljevic warns. “If you’re outside, and your dog is visibly stressed, calmly remove them from the stressful situation and return home or to a quieter area.”\nShould I give my dog medication for Halloween stress?\nMost dogs can make it through Halloween without medication, Jones says, but each dog is different. If you’re considering looking into medication to help your dog manage isolated, stressful nights like Halloween, consult your vet in advance to give yourself time to try out the medication, see if it works, and adjust the dosage (with help from your vet) if needed.\nIfanti-anxiety medicationsseem too extreme, you can also speak with your vet about calming supplements or pheromone diffusers.\nHalloween can be a busy, logistics-heavy holiday, but follow these tips, and you and your dog will be dancing to “Monster Mash” in no time.",

  },
  "page_content": "Dogs are highly social animals with a complex system of communication that allows them to interact with other dogs and humans. Through a combination of body language, vocalizations, scent signals, and expressions, dogs can convey various emotions, intentions, and information to one another.\nEven though your dogs are speaking another language, if you carefully observe them, you will be able to understand their “language” and bring your relationship to the next level. Understanding how dogs communicate is an important skill for dog parents. It can prevent a dog bite, or dog fight, and help a scared or nervous dog feel comfortable. When reading your dog’s body language, it’s important to look at the whole picture of your dog to get the full message they are trying to relay.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nDogs use the forms of communication below to allow humans and other dogs to understand what they are feeling. Understanding your dog’s body language can help you keep yourself, your family, and other dogs safe in all situations.\nHow to tell the difference between dog aggression and communication.\nHow do dogs communicate with each other?\nDogs communicate with each other through body language and sounds. When a dog is a puppy they learn how to communicate through interactions with their mother and siblings.\nYes, dogs use barking as a form of communication. Typically, a dog barking at another dog can communicate excitement, a need for space, or an alert that it is frustrated. The different tones in a dog’s bark can help you differentiate what the bark is trying to tell the other dog. A bark during play sounds more exciting; it is usually higher pitched. A bark when a dog tries to get space or show frustration will be much deeper.\nGrowling, whining, and howling can be other vocalizations that dogs may use to communicate with other dogs. Each type of vocalization communicates a different message. When adog growls, it is typically a warning sign that they are trying to give off, there is something they are not fond of and would like it to stop. When a dog growls and the other dog listens they prevent the escalation of a situation. Growling can also be playful. Some dogs are very chatty when they play, and growling is part of the way they play. It can seem scary from the outside, which is why it is important to know your dog.\nAdog whineswhen they are trying to communicate a need, they may need food, water, or to go outside to pee or poop. Some dog breeds can howl. Howling can be used for excitement, but it also may be used to alert. Have you ever noticed your dog sneezing when they are excited or want to play?Dogs sneezeto communicate excitement or happy feelings, or maybe they just got a tickle in their nose. Snorting is another form of communication that dogs use. Dogs may snort to communicate that they want attention or are frustrated.\nAn air snap is abigform of communication coming from your dog. If you notice your dog air-snapping at another dog, they are trying to tell them they are very uncomfortable. If does an air-snap and the other dog does not stop their behavior, they may feel motivated to bite. Typically, if a dog is air-snapping, they have tried many other forms of communication and their message was not received, so they are now going to the next level.\nDog scent plays an integral role in communication, dogs can learn a lot of information about other dogs from their scent. Dogs use their urine or scent glands in their paws to leave messages wherever they go. Their scent can communicate their gender, age, whether they are spayed/neutered, and their health or emotional status.\nDogs observe their environment and use their sense of sight and sound to understand what is happening around them. Because dogs cannot communicate with words they use their senses to get their message across and to understand them.\nThis body language is not as simple as you probably think.\nSpecific dog communication methods\nA wagging tail does not always mean a happy dog. Tail movement is one of the ways dogs use their body to communicate. The height and speed of a dog’s tail have a lot to tell about how they are feeling. A tail pointing up high means that your dog is alert and excited, this could be to see their friend or squirrel that ran across the street and they want to chase it. When their tail is wagging straight out from their body in line with their back that means they are feeling neutral about a situation or may be exploring intently. If a dog’s tail is pointing down it may be a cause for worry, this position typically means they are submissive and concerned.\nWhen the tail is wagging, it adds more meaning to the position and body language your dog is trying to convey. A fast wagging tail is an excited dog, and wide strokes mean that your dog is happy. When you see a dog’s tail wagging slowly, they are not thrilled with the situation, and when the tail is moving low and very slow they are stressed or anxious.\nHas you everseen a dog smile? A smile in dog language can mean different things, and it is not always the same as a human's smile. A dog that is showing relaxed body language, and a happy tail wag may smile if they are enjoying something. But a dog may also smile when feeling frightened (look for other signs of fear in dogs). They will also lift or curl their lip if they want to show that they need space from a situation.\nAdditionally, ears are a body part used in dog communication dogs ears are always moving and giving off more information than you would think. Whether your dog has pointy ears or floppy ears they will still give off messages. If you have ever noticed your dog’sears go flator pulled far back on their head your dog is trying to show that they are scared. Ears up may mean they are alert and curious listening to what's happening around them.\nNot only can dogs communicate by body movements they can also use their eyes to communicate. Staring is a rude behavior in dog language, it can lead to intimidation and the build-up can cause a dog fight. Slow blinking and soft eyes during eye contact mean they are calm, content or happy. Or they may show the whites of their eyes, aka “whale eye.” Whale eye communicates that your dog may be worried or stressed. If you notice whale eye along with other signs your dog is uncomfortable, it is best to get them the space they need.\nMarking is a way for a dog to tell other dogs or animals they have been here. Dogs may mark to tell other dogs they are frustrated or anxious. A dog who has been spayed or neutered may be less likely to mark to show territory.\nCelebrity dog trainerVictoria Stilwell on how to keep your dog from using your living room as a toilet.\nBreed-specific communication traits\nHowling would be considered a breed specific communication trait, but not all dogs can howl. Certain breeds also have different types of barks that they use for communication, though other dogs may not have the ability to make similar sounds. Wolf related breeds such as Shar-pei, Chow-Chow or Basenji are unlikely to bark, but hunting breeds will use a specific type of barking to get their message across.\nThe importance of context\nObserving your dog as a whole is important to understand what they are communicating. Looking at one form of communication/body language may not always tell you exactly what your dog is trying to say. But if you look at the dog as a whole; the environment and each part of your dog (vocalizations, body posture, tail, eye contact, and facial expressions) you will get a clear picture of what your dog wants to tell other dogs.\nLili Chin’s bookDoggie Languageillustrates how dogs communicate — beyond ear perks and tail wags.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nDogs can argue ordisagree with each other. When dogs are not very social or do not listen to another dogs’ body language, this can cause issues. Social dogs will have a disagreement and communicate with body language and then resolve the situation by giving each other space. Dogs who are not well socialized or don’t understand how to read other dogs’ cues may cause an argument to become worse by not taking a hint and a dog fight may happen.\nNo, a dog’s growl doesnot always mean aggression. A growl is just a way for a dog to give information that they are displeased or need space. Typically, a growl is used to prevent a situation from escalating. If the other dog does not pay attention to the growl, or accompanying body language, a fight can start.\nIf you notice a dog with stiff body language, this dog is uncomfortable. A stiff dog may look frozen or tight when moving.\nLoose dog body language shows the dog is relaxed and ready to play. A loose dog is happy, calm, and enjoying the environment.\nWhen a dog’s hackles go up, that means the hair along their spine is standing straight up. When this happens, it can mean a few different things. Your dog may be defensive, excited, afraid, uncertain, or surprised.\nReferences:\nCommunication in Dogs\nCommunication in Dogs\nExcessive Barking\nExcessive Barking",

  "page_content": "Yes, your dog is judging you. That is, if your dog is a female. Have a male dog? You may be living in a judgment-free zone. In other words, according to a2022 study, female dogsare more critical than the gymnastics judges at the Olympics.More so, they care about competence — they evaluate people and respond accordingly. Males don’t act the same way (at least not those observed in the study).\nThey can sniff out where you’ve hidden their treats, but deception is another matter.\nShe may judge, just not about your ability to open a pickle jar.\nIn the study, researchers set up an experiment to investigate dogs’ ability to recognize competence in people and to see if they adjusted their own behavior depending on whether a person was or was not competent. Dogs watched two people try to open an empty container. One person was successful at opening it, and one person failed in their attempt.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThe people then repeated this with a different container, with each person consistently either being the competent one or the incompetent one (mimicking real life for those of us who have never opened a pickle jar on their own). Then, the people simultaneously tried to open a third container, and researchers observed the dogs’ behavior. Half the dogs (30 of them) were watching people try to open containers with food inside and the other half (30 dogs) were watching people try to open empty containers.\nThe dogs were faced with a choice of heading over to the person who struggled to open the container or the person who opened it with ease. Although male dogs showed no preference for one person over the other, 83 percent of the female dogs chose to approach the person who was competent. There’s no evidence that the dogs were thinking,Game recognizes game, but I like to think that they were.\nWhen faced with people trying to open empty containers, neither male nor female dogs showed any preference for competent people over incompetent people. That means these dogs cared more about competence when it mattered than when it was irrelevant. The female dogs had no reason to care about a person’s ability to open an empty container, which makes sense.\nYou and your pup are on the same wavelength—seriously.\nDogs are careful observers.\nDogs have evolved alongside humans, and during the thousands of years they have closely associated with people, they have developed high-level abilities to pay attention to us and understand our behavior and emotions. They have previously been shown to distinguishbetween selfish and giving people(those who share treats versus those who want it all themselves), andfriendly peopleversus people who paid no attention to them. Dogs benefit from associating with generous or friendly people, and they also gain resources if they choose to be around competent people rather than those who are incompetent.\nAnother difference between the males and the females in this experiment was that female dogs looked at the people for a longer duration of time. That is consistent with a number of studies that show differences between the sexes. Female dogslooked longer at picturesof dog and human faces than male dogs did. Females looked at their people more frequently and for a longer amount of time when they were stumped trying tosolve a task. They also looked at their people longer afterbeing given oxytocin.\nFuture research is needed to explore whether dogs evaluatecompetence in other situations, and whether males ever pay attention to competence. For now, remember science only has evidence that points toward your sweet, smart, perfect (and yes, judgmental) girl dog.\nReferences:\nFemale Dogs Evaluate Levels of Competence in Humans\nFemale Dogs Evaluate Levels of Competence in Humans\nSex, Skull Length, Breed, and Age Predict How Dogs Look at Faces of Humans and Conspecifics\nSex, Skull Length, Breed, and Age Predict How Dogs Look at Faces of Humans and Conspecifics\nSelfish Versus Giving People Dogs’ Discrimination of Human Selfish and Generous Attitudes: The Role of Individual Recognition, Experience, and Experimenters’ Gender\nSelfish Versus Giving People Dogs’ Discrimination of Human Selfish and Generous Attitudes: The Role of Individual Recognition, Experience, and Experimenters’ Gender\nDopamine Receptor D4 Gene (DRD4) Is Associated With Gazing Toward Humans in Domestic Dogs (Canis familiaris)\nDopamine Receptor D4 Gene (DRD4) Is Associated With Gazing Toward Humans in Domestic Dogs (Canis familiaris)\nOxytocin-Gaze Positive Loop and the Coevolution of Human-Dog Bonds\nOxytocin-Gaze Positive Loop and the Coevolution of Human-Dog Bonds\nFriendly People Versus Those Who Ignored Dogs\nFriendly People Versus Those Who Ignored Dogs",

  "page_content": "It’s hard to resist the urge to put dogs in costumes. The cuteness factor can fly off the charts, and for many people, dressing up their dogs is as natural as dressing up children. There’s a certain joy in seeing pups parading around as cowgirls, devils, sports stars, or Elvis, but I have bad news to share with you: Most dogs hate costumes.\nWhy don’t dogs like wearing costumes?\nDogs don’t like wearing costumes becausethey easily become stressedand uncomfortable when wearing clothing, especially anything on their head or around their bodies.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n“To a dog, a costume, fitting tight around the dog’s midriff and back, might well reproduce that ancestral feeling [of being scolded by a more powerful dog],” says dog cognition researcher and professorDr. Alexandra HorowitzinThe New Yorker. “The experience of wearing a costume would not be the experience of festivity.”\nAKA a night that won’t turn into a scary time at the emergency vet.\nSigns that your dog doesn’t like wearing their costume might include looking tense with a closed mouth. A stiff body is indicative of a dog who is not comfortable — it’s as though they are frozen in angst. In contrast, a content dog will have a happy face and a relaxed body and tail.\nPicking dog-friendly Halloween costumes\nIf you simplymusthave your dog participate in dressing up on Halloween, costumes that don’t impair your dog’s movements are best. Because most dogs are accustomed to wearing collars, small costumes that consist of something around the neck are the most easily tolerated.\nThe key word is “small.” Rather than dressing a dog up in a full tuxedo, for example, having them sport just a small bow tie may be easier for your dog to handle. This can be a great compromise that works for both people and dogs. Costumes that dogs barely notice are great options. When it comes to picking a Halloween costume for your pup, use a “less is more” approach:\nPick unobtrusive costumes.\nPick unobtrusive costumes.\nPick simple and soft.\nPick simple and soft.\nDon’t cover their face.\nDon’t cover their face.\nDon’t impair their movement.\nDon’t impair their movement.\nScarier thanHalloween Kills.\nOne easy costume idea forblack dogs: Use baby powder applied as a strip down their back to create a skunk — or a few more stripes of baby powder, and you’ve got yourself a skeleton. It’s cute, easy, and won’t bother most dogs.\nOr, make it more of an audience participation activity. Ask trick-or-treaters what they think about your dog: “What do you think of my cat’s costume? Doesn’t she look exactly like a dog?” This way, you can have your dog participate in the holiday spirit without making your pup feel uncomfortable.

    "title": "Can Dogs Be Depressed? Signs and Treatment for Canine Depression",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-health/dog-depression"
  },
  "page_content": "Dogs can experience depression-like symptoms, due to factors, like major life changes or medical conditions, exhibiting signs, such as decreased appetite and lethargy. However, it’s essential for pet parents to consult with a veterinarian to rule out underlying health issues and determine the best course of action.Depression affects many people and can be a major health issue for some. But can dogs experience depression too?Dr. Lore I. Haug, a board-certified veterinary behavior specialist who works at the VCA Lexington Boulevard Animal Hospital in Sugar Land, Texas, says, “Most likely, yes.”\nDr. Haug says that while there is no official depression diagnosis for dogs and cats, given the similarities to humans in their brain anatomy and neurochemistry, “it is reasonable to hypothesize that dogs do suffer depression in their own way.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nDogs and cats can’t read self-help books, so a veterinary behaviorist explains how your pet may benefit from being in treatment.\nIs my dog depressed?\nBecause dogs can’t express what they’re feeling in terms that are clear to humans, diagnosing depression in dogs is challenging and uncommon. In people, clinical depression can include a variety of complex, persistent emotions and mental states, including:\nAnhedonia (a reduction in the ability to feel pleasure)\nAnhedonia (a reduction in the ability to feel pleasure)\nDifficulty concentrating\nDifficulty concentrating\nAlterations in social behaviors\nAlterations in social behaviors\nTrouble with making decisions\nTrouble with making decisions\nLearned helplessness\nLearned helplessness\nPessimism about likely outcomes\nPessimism about likely outcomes\nFeelings of worthlessness\nFeelings of worthlessness\nExcessive guilt\nExcessive guilt\nThoughts of death\nThoughts of death\nIdentifying these feelings in dogs makes a definitive diagnosis of depressionchallenging, even for veterinary behaviorists. It’s possible your dog could be experiencing depression-like symptoms, especially if they begin after amajor stressoror significant life change.\nHere’s why your pup may get the winter blues, too.\nWhat can trigger depression in dogs?\nDr. Haug says that depression — in both humans and research animals — is in large part a response to feeling like one lacks control over their environment. As she puts it: “The feeling that nothing you do matters or can change your situation.”\nIn the case of dogs, this means that when they feel like they have no control over their lives — like when and what they eat, where to walk, and when and who they can play with — they may begin to experience feelings of helplessness that can lead to depression.\nHyper-controlling training styles can be similarly deleterious to the dog’s well-being, because, as Dr. Haug says, “the dogs do not have any choice or ability to express their own wants and needs.”\nOther potential triggers, according to the American Kennel Club, include major changes to their environment and lifestyle, such as a big move, the loss of a human or animal companion, the introduction of a new baby or animal into the home, and social isolation.\nAdditionally, while experts don’t know whether depression is more common in certain breeds, dogs that experienced trauma or abuse may be more prone to it and require extra care and stimulation to help them manage feelings of fear and anxiety.\nNot all fearful dogs have been mistreated.\nSymptoms of depression in dogs\nLike humans, if your dog is withdrawn, or doesn’t seem interested in the activities they usually love (playing fetch, walking, or even eating) that could be a sign that they are experiencing depression. Dr. Haug is quick to underscore, however, that it’s important to rule out any potential physical ailments first.\n“As there is overlap between behavior changes in dogs with medical issues and ‘depression,’ owners should always consult with a veterinarian before assuming their dog is depressed,” she says.\nA sudden change in behavior, especially after a major life change, may lead some pet parents to wonder, “how do I know if my dog is depressed?” Some symptoms that could indicate a dog is depressed include:\nDecreased appetite or weight loss\nDecreased appetite or weight loss\nLethargy or decreased activity levels\nLethargy or decreased activity levels\nWithdrawal from or avoiding interaction with family members or other pets\nWithdrawal from or avoiding interaction with family members or other pets\nExcessive sleeping\nExcessive sleeping\nLoss of interest in activities they once enjoyed\nLoss of interest in activities they once enjoyed\nIncreased vocalization or whining\nIncreased vocalization or whining\nSelf-trauma or obsessive behavior\nSelf-trauma or obsessive behavior\nIncreased anxiety\nIncreased anxiety\nAgain, it is important to note that all the above symptoms can also signal physical health issues as well. This is why it’s important to have your vet examine your dog to look for possible medical causes for altered behaviors. Even if you know that a significant life change occurred for your dog before the onset of their symptoms, it’s vital to rule out other health problems before assuming your dog is depressed.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a shy pup to go from wallflower to social butterfly.\nTreatment options for canine depression\nIf you and your veterinarian are concerned that your dog is experiencing a depressive episode or has a depressive disorder, there are some treatment options available. For many dogs, simple, positive changes to their routine and environment may help to alleviate symptoms. Other dogs may need more intensive therapy ormedicationsto begin feeling like themselves again. Your veterinarian may recommend treatment strategies for depressions such as:\nOnce physical health problems have been ruled out, your vet may recommend consultation with a veterinary behaviorist like Dr. Haug to better establish if depression could be the cause of your dog’s symptoms and set up a treatment and monitoring plan.\nDogs seem to enjoy a predictable routine that helps to make them feel like their day is under control. As much as possible, try to establish a regular schedule of walks, feeding, playtime, and exercise that fits your dog’s lifestyle and activity level. If recent life events have disrupted your dog’s routine, try to return to a schedule that they were familiar with previously.\nProvide your dog withactivities and distractionsto help keep them active and mentally stimulated. Treat puzzles, play mats, and play dates can help to providehealthy diversionsthat your dog can enjoy.\nIncorporating exerciseinto your dog’s day can help to provide social interaction, quality time with you, and mental stimulation. If your dog has been a couch potato, always introduce and increase exercise gradually. Sudden overexertion and soreness won’t make this a pleasant addition to your dog’s routine.\nWorking with a veterinary behaviorist can help to give you a variety of strategies to shape your dog’s behavior and perspective. The baseline concept of behavioral therapy is to reward desirable behaviors and avoid either purposefully or inadvertently rewarding unhealthy or undesirable responses. Punishing a dog for showing symptoms of depression is not productive and could worsen the condition.\nMedication may be needed for some dogs with persistent depression-like symptoms. Some more natural solutions like pheromone collars, l-theanine, or alpha-casozepine may be recommended by your vet to see if they help. Starting on an SSRI medication is a bigger decision and may be one that is difficult to know the true effects of. SSRIs take about a month to reach full effectiveness, so separating the impact of the medication from other lifestyle modifications may be difficult if the medication is started early.\nOr are they just peacefully resting? Behaviorist Karen London explains how to tell the difference.\nWhat can you do to help a dog who seems to be experiencing depression?\nAs with most maladies, human or canine, the best treatment for depression in dogs is prevention. Learn what type of environment, food, exercise, and mental stimulation is best for your dog, and provide it for them.\n“Owners need to make appropriate breed choices for their living situation,” Dr. Haug says. A busy college student in a tiny apartment may love Labradors, she says, but that doesn’t mean they’re able to give them the attention, training, and exercise the breed needs to be happy and healthy.\nIf a dog is already showing symptoms of depression, and a veterinarian has ruled out any possible physical issues like pain or illness, Dr. Haug recommends finding a professional behaviorist who can evaluate the dog and their living situation, and provide recommendations appropriate for that animal, family, and home. For those interested in contacting a behaviorist, she recommends the following sites: American College of Veterinary Behaviorists, The American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior, and the Pet Professional Guild.\nUltimately, whether your dog has seemed down in the dumps recently or not, Dr. Haug says it’s important to always make sure they receive adequate mental and physical stimulation, as well the necessary training and education to help both you and your pet better understand each other.\n“Training classes are obligatory,” she says. “No dog should grow up ‘illiterate!’”\nHow to cure dog depression is an open question because the diagnosis of depression in dogs is not well established. A combination of environmental enrichment, positive behavioral reinforcement, and medication may be needed to get depression-like symptoms under control.\nThere have not been documented instances of dogs dying from depression. Some dogs showing depression-like symptoms may stop eating for a period, become lethargic, and show little interest in normal activities. These signs can be associated with other serious medical issues, so it’s important to have your dog examined if you’re worried that they’re depressed.\nIt certainly seems like it sometimes.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nAlthoughseasonal affective disorder (SAD)is not recognized in dogs like it is in people, dogs’ attitudes may change as the days get shorter and darker. It’s not clear if this is due to weather-related changes in routine or something bigger.\nOnce physical causes for your dog’s behavior changes have been ruled out, consulting with a veterinary behaviorist may be the best way to develop effective strategies to get your dog back to their routine.\nIt’s tough to know if dogs can have an existential crisis and learn to express their feelings about it. There’s still much to learn about how dogs interact withsound boards, and this is a topic of ongoing research in the field.\nReferences:\nCould Greater Time Spent Displaying Waking Inactivity in the Home Environment Be a Marker for a Depression-Like State in the Domestic Dog?\nCould Greater Time Spent Displaying Waking Inactivity in the Home Environment Be a Marker for a Depression-Like State in the Domestic Dog?\nDo Dogs Grieve?\nDo Dogs Grieve?\nInfluence of Owners’ Attachment Style and Personality on Their Dogs’ (Canis familiaris) Separation-Related Disorder\nInfluence of Owners’ Attachment Style and Personality on Their Dogs’ (Canis familiaris) Separation-Related Disorder\nHow do Soundboard-Trained Dogs Respond to Human Button Presses?

  "page_content": "When I look into my dogs’ big round eyes, it’s hard to believe they’d ever lie to me. But then, they see me eating a bowl of cereal and start whining like they haven’t been fed for a week, and I’ll admit, I start to wonder.\nAnecdotally, we’ve all probably heardstories about dogs faking being sickfor attention, but are any of them true? Is this a classic case of interpreting a very normal dog behavior through a not-so-accurate human lens, or do dogs really know how to yank our chains? I asked the experts to find out.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nApparently wild dogs can be pretty cute, too.\nThey’re not lying. But they’re notnotlying.\nScience has shown that on some level, dogsdosometimes think about how to manipulate circumstances to their benefit. Animal behaviorist Mia Bonadonna cites a small2017 studypublished inAnimal Cognition, which found that, as she puts it, “dogs may knowingly deceive uncooperative human competitors for high-value treats.” (The actual results of the study,as describedbySmithsonian,are genuinely fascinating.)\nStill, Bonadonna says, “I think an argument can be made that animals are not necessarily being willfully or maliciously deceptive. Rather they are active, perceptive learners that are more likely to repeat actions that result in a benefit for their survival.”\nIn other words, dogs probably don’t “lie” in the same ways (or for the same reasons) that people do. It’s more likely that they figure out which behaviors reward material desires like food, toys, and attention and act accordingly.\nCertified professional dog trainer Dae Grodin also does not believe that dogs are capable of deceit in the way that humans typically understand it. “I think dogs more or less think about what happens [when] they do xyz behaviors,” she says. “In order to have emotions/actions like deceit, guilt, etc., there needs to be a higher level problem solving involved, along with emotional forethought.”\nAlthough it’s rare, Grodindoesbelieve that dogs might sometimes fabricate afflictions for attention. She met one such trickster years ago at the kennel where she worked at the time. The dog would behave normally all day, and then, when their parent came to get them, they’d start limping. At first, the parent would get concerned and reward the dog with attention — but once they caught on, the afternoon limping charades finally stopped.Curious.\nYou and your pup are on the same wavelength—seriously.\nThere’s a difference between getting your attention and being really sick.\nOf course, smaller deceptions are more common. I felt personally vindicated when Grodin said she believes that some pets try to “convince” their parents they need a snack or another meal when they’ve just eaten. (I’ll never give my dogs seconds after dinner again.) Grodin says she’s also seen dogs run to the door when they want another pooch’s toy. Once the other dog runs to the door, the first dog will run back to steal the coveted prize.\nIf your dog’s condition is not severe, and they don’t appear to be in distress, Grodin suggests that pet parents might conduct a little experiment. “If we think [the strange behavior] is attention based, the individual can try not giving any attention to that certain behavior and see how their pet reacts,” Grodin says. “They can try this for a few days and see if the behavior changes or not. If it is prolonged, there may be something else going on where they may need further diagnostics.”\nBut if your dog genuinely appears sick or injured, it’s very unlikely they’re faking it. Regardless of how they present themselves, it’s important to take dogs’ symptoms seriously.\n“While I love the idea that dogs have the agency, social complexity, and intellectual ability to deceive a human,” Bonadonna says, “ultimately, it is harmful to assume that a dog might fake an injury or illness … Dog guardians shouldalwaysconsult a veterinarian when there is a concern that their dog is sick or hurt.”\nThey can sniff out where you’ve hidden their treats, but deception is another matter.\nWhen in doubt, always assume there is something actually wrong.\nYes, there’s achancethat an observant dog might become injured, notice the amount of attention they receive, and fake an injury later. But generally, this would be a stretch. “Acute pain floods the brain with so much stress-associated hormone that memory retention related to beneficial things is challenging,” Bonadonna says. In terms of memory, mammals’ brains usually prioritize information related to threats, rather than things that are nice and soothing.\nSo whilesomepet parents and trainers might witness an Oscar-worthy performance from their pups, if your dog is sick or limping, it’s best to take it seriously.\n“There is no data to suggest that our companion dogs are regularly deceiving us about injury or illness,” Bonadonna says. “To the contrary, the behavior data and research suggests that we humans frequently miss and misinterpret behavioral indicators of real pain, injury, and disease in our companion dogs.”\nIf you notice any significant change in your dog’s behavior, consult with your veterinarian to rule out any possible medical cause. Assuming otherwise could jeopardize your dog’s health, safety, and wellbeing. When it comes to your dog’s health, it’s always better to be safe than sorry.",

  "page_content": "You’ve probably already noticed that there are some messages your dog gets loud and clear, while others seem to go right over their perfect little heads. They might stare at you blankly during your breathless explanation of the plot ofThe Bear, but they seem to know exactly who issuch a good doggie. Now, scientists are getting to the bottom of how we can better communicate with our dogs.A new studypublished inPLOS Biologyfound that dogs understand slow speech better than fast speech — meaning the next time you’re chatting with your pup, you might want to channel Christopher Walken rather than Katharine Hepburn.\nHow dog and human speech patterns differ\nResearchers analyzed the vocal sequences of 30 dogs — all their barks, growls, howls, snarls, and whines. They also analyzed the speech patterns of 27 humans speaking to other humans across five languages, plus 22 humans speaking to dogs across five languages. They found that dogs vocalize more slowly than humans; while humans speak about four syllables per second, dogs vocalize at a rate of about two sounds per second.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nYou and your pup are on the same wavelength—seriously.\nThey also found that when speaking to dogs, humans tended to speak at a slower rate than when speaking to humans — but still a faster rate than when dogs speak to each other. On average, people lower their speech rate to about three syllables per second when addressing pups.\nHow dogs best understand speech\nThe researchers then performed EEGs on dogs and humans to measure their neural activity. They found that dogs best process delta rhythms, which relate to the long, slow rhythms in speech like intonation and pauses. Humans, though, prioritize processing theta rhythms — the faster parts of speech, like individual syllables.\nDogs are not able to process the quick, intricate parts of our sentences, but they can get the gist when we take it slow. This means that our instinct to slow down our speech when we’re talking to our pups is right, but we could even take it one notch further. The researchers hope that this knowledge can help promote stronger bonds between people and dogs. After all, our dogs are ready to listen — they just want us to take our time.",

Get ready for the adventure of a lifetime — because let’s be real, parenting a dog is basically signing up for a full-time job with plenty of slobber and tail-wagging. But honestly, it’s also the best thing ever.\nYour experience as a first-time pet parent can really be shaped by the breed or breed mix you choose, their personality, and temperament. Sure, not every dog in a breed is cookie-cutter, but different breeds come with their own quirks and care needs. So, before you commit, it’s worthsniffing out their personalityand tendencies.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nLet’s break down some of the best dog breeds for first-time pet parents. Whether you’re looking for a low-energy, gentle giant or a non-shedding lap dog, grab a leash and a cup of coffee (trust us, you’ll need it), and let’s dive in. Remember, there are plenty of rescue dogs who need good homes, and you can most likely find the breed or mix you want at a shelter. U.S. shelters are overflowing, so please do your research for breed-specific rescues; you can find the kind of dog you’re looking for while doing a good thing.\nThe dogs — 20 of them puppies — will be available for adoption in the coming weeks.\nBest breeds for first-time dog parents\nFrom the ever-popular Golden Retriever to the spunky Papillon and beyond, here are some top contenders that are known for their friendly demeanor, adaptability, and overall awesomeness.\nThe Golden Retriever is pretty much the OG of family-friendly pups, and they make perfect first dogs. These pups are basically like sunshine on four legs, with their friendly demeanor and ever-wagging tails. Need a buddy for outdoor adventures? They're all in. Want a snuggle partner for movie nights? They've got you covered.\nPlus, they're super smart and easy to train, making them a great pick for first-time pet parents who want a versatile and loving companion. Just keep in mind, their luscious coats do require regular grooming to keep them looking their best.\nLabs are like the class clowns of the dog world, always up for a good time and never failing to put a smile on your face. With their outgoing personality, trainability, and boundless energy, they are a top choice for first timers. Plus, they’re total pros at fetch and swimming, so they’ll keep you entertained for hours on end. Grooming-wise, be prepared for some shedding and invest in a good brush to keep their coats in tip-top shape.\nBichon Frisés are like fluffy little clouds on four legs. They’re basically walking cotton balls, with their soft, curly coats and sweet, expressive eyes. Bichons are known for their cheerful disposition and love of a good snuggle, making them ideal companions for first-time pet parents craving close connection. Those luscious locks, however, require regular grooming to prevent matting and keep them looking their fluffiest.\nThese elegant hounds are the ultimate couch potatoes when they’re indoors, but give them an open field to stretch their legs, and they’ll show you just how fast they can go. Greyhounds are known for their gentle and laid-back nature — they’re surprisingly low-maintenance pets, despite their mad agility skills. Their short coats do shed moderately, so regular brushing will help keep the fur situation under control.\nWith their regal demeanor and soulful eyes, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are sure to steal your heart in an instant. They’re renowned for their affectionate nature and love of companionship, and they also make great lap dogs. Small in size but big in personality, they’re the perfect fit for apartment dwellers and families alike. Just be prepared for some grooming duties to keep their silky coats looking their best.\nPrepare to be charmed by the daintiest of doggos — the Papillon. With their butterfly-like ears and sprightly personalities, these little pups are as elegant as they are energetic. Papillons are known for their intelligence and agility, making them quick learners and eager participants in any activity. Their small size also makes them a great fit for apartment living. However, their long, silky coats do require regular grooming to prevent matting and tangles.\nWant a purebred? Here’s yet another reason you should rescue one.\nWorst breeds for first-time dog parents\nWhile there’s no bad dog breed (because honestly, we love them all), there are some that aren’t well suited for first-time pet parents. Dogs with extremely high energy, strong guarding tendencies, and lots of grooming needs might give novice dog moms and dads a tough time.\nHigh-energy breeds are like the canine equivalent of a kid on a sugar rush — they’re always on the go and ready for action. While their boundless enthusiasm can be infectious, it can also be a handful for first-time pet parents who may not have the time or energy to match their pup’s pace.\nThese breeds thrive on plenty of exercise and mental stimulation, so if you’re not prepared to commit todaily walks, runs, and play sessions, you might want to think twice before bringing home one of these energetic furballs.Examples: Border Collie, Australian Shepherd, Jack Russell Terrier\nIf you’re not ready to channel your inner hairstylist, dogs withhigh grooming needsare likely not a great option for you. They require lots of regular primping and pampering to keep their coats looking fabulous. While their luxurious locks may be a sight to behold, they also come with a hefty grooming commitment that may not be ideal for first-time pet parents with busy schedules or limited grooming experience.\nFrom brushing and bathing to trimming and styling, these breeds demand a significant time and effort investment to maintain their pristine appearance.\nExamples: Afghan Hound, Standard Poodle, Shih Tzu\nWhat is the best dog breed for me?\nBefore you commit to a new canine companion, there are a few important factors to consider to ensure you find the perfect match for your lifestyle and personality. From size and energy level to grooming needs and trainability, we’re breaking down everything you need to know to find the best dog breed for you.\nSize matters — especially when it comes to choosing the right dog breed for your home. Whether you’re living in a cozy apartment or sprawling countryside estate, it’s important to consider how much space your new family member will need to thrive. Larger breeds may require more room to stretch their legs, while smaller breeds can adapt well to apartment living. So, before you bring home that adorable ball of fluff, make sure you have enough space to accommodate their size and energy levels.\nReady to keep up with a four-legged tornado of energy? Or looking for a laid-back couch potato to cuddle up with? Energy level is a crucial factor to consider when choosing the right dog breed for your lifestyle. High-energy breeds such as Border Collies and Huskies thrive on plenty of exercise and mental stimulation, while low-energy breeds such as Basset Hounds and Saint Bernards prefer lounging around the house. It’s a good idea to give some thought to how much time and energy you're willing to invest in keeping your pup happy and healthy.\nGrooming needs\nFrom daily brushing and regular baths to monthly haircuts and occasional trims, grooming needs can vary widely depending on the breed. Love spending hours at the salon getting pampered? Then a high-maintenance breed might be right up your alley. But if you’re more of a wash-and-go type of person, you’ll want to opt for a low-maintenance breed that won’t require as much grooming.\nSome pups are eager to please and quick to learn, while others just…aren’t. Trainability is an important factor to consider when choosing the right dog breed for your family. Some breeds, such as Golden Retrievers and Labrador Retrievers, are known for their intelligence and trainability.\nOthers, such as Beagles and Dachshunds, may be a bit more stubborn and independent, requiring extra patience and consistency during training sessions. Think about your training goals and how much time and effort you're able to invest in teaching your pup the ropes.\nWhen choosing the right dog breed for your family, it’s important to consider their compatibility with children and other animals. Some breeds are known for their gentle and tolerant nature, while others may be more wary of small children or prone to conflicts with other animals. Before you make your decision, think about your family dynamic and choose a breed that will fit in seamlessly with your lifestyle and existing pack members.\nFurther proof that you can — and should — adopt rescued designer dogs.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nWhen looking for dog breeds suitable for first-timepet parents in apartments, people tend to prioritize small size, adaptability, and moderate energy levels. Consider breeds such as Yorkshire Terriers, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, and Bichon Frisés.\nBreeds with high energy levels, strong guarding tendencies, or extensive grooming requirements may not be ideal for novice pet parents. Examples include breeds such as Border Collies, German Shepherds, Chow Chows, and Afghan Hounds. These breeds often require experienced handling, consistent training, and a dedicated grooming regimen, making them less suitable for new pet parents.\nSeveralmedium-sized breedsstand out as being good for first-time pet parents for their manageable size, friendly temperament, and adaptability. Breeds such as the Beagle, Cocker Spaniel, and Australian Cattle Dog are excellent choices for those seeking a canine companion that's not too large but still offers plenty of personality and loyalty.\nReferences:\nExpectations versus Reality of Designer Dog Ownership in the United States\nExpectations versus Reality of Designer Dog Ownership in the United States\nLooking for a Well-Behaved Dog?

  },
  "page_content": "Dogs walking sideways, also known as crabbing or sidewinding, is a peculiar sight. While this behavior can be a quirk or a temporary adjustment to physical changes, it could also be a sign of underlying health issues, like hip dysplasia or vision problems, that require attention.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nNormal reasons for sideways walking\nA dog can walk sideways for many reasons and in many different ways. Some dog parents want to know why their dog always walks at an angle when on a leash. Other dogs seem to walk sideways after grooming or when they’re excited. Becoming familiar with your dog’s normal gait and behaviors can help you to recognize what’s normal and spot problems when they arise.\nSome breeds are more likely to do a type of sideways walking called “crabbing” when they’re trying to trot. This is due to the mechanics of trotting in dogs. During a trot, legs diagonal from each other move at the same time. This type of gait results in a forelimb in a slightly back position when a hindlimb on the same side comes forward.\nMost dogs can trot in a straight line, but dogs with long legs relative to their body length can have trouble with this because their hind foot wants to land where their front leg is planted. To avoid their legs getting tangled, they’ll trot at a slight angle so their legs are no longer perfectly aligned. Some dog breeds that may display crab walking include:\nGerman Shepherd Dogs\nGerman Shepherd Dogs\nDoberman Pinschers\nDoberman Pinschers\nBorder Collies\nBorder Collies\nSome Spaniel breeds\nSome Spaniel breeds\nParents of active dogs (especially puppies) may wonder,Why does my dog walk sideways when excited? Dogs will often move at an angle or almost completely sideways when they’re excited about something.\nThey may be using the change in angle to look back at you to make sure you’re coming along to share in their excitement. Many dogs willcurve their bodiesand hop or stand sideways away from you during play as well. This behavior is perfectly normal, and just means you’re part of the fun.\nWhen walking on rough trails orhiking in hilly areas, it’s expected that dogs will adjust their gait to account for any obstacles or steep angles they encounter. Dogs will naturally try to find the body position that allows them to stay as steady as possible. At times, this could mean that they’re walking at an odd angle.\nDogs tugging on a neck lead will often walk at an angle because they’re straining against the limits of the leash and their back end can move forward more freely than their front end. This can be helped byproper leash trainingand using a chest harness instead of a neck lead.\nDog trainer Karen B. London promises you’re not doomed to be pulled down the street forever.\nWhy does my old dog walk sideways?\nA senior dog walking sideways is most commonly due to pain or a balance issue. If your older dog has a sudden change in the way they’re walking, alert a veterinarian as soon as possible.\nIt could indicate muscle or joint pain, idiopathic vestibular disease, back pain, or a neurological condition. Getting your senior dog examined by your vet can help to get to the cause of sideways walking and hopefully get them comfortable and walking normally quickly.\nWhy is my dog suddenly walking sideways?\nWhile many dogs may normally walk sideways, a sudden change in your dog’s gait, body posture, or balance may indicate a problem. Some causes may be obvious. Dogs wearingnew clothes(including sweaters, jackets,ThunderShirts, booties, or harnesses) can walk crooked as they adjust to their new gear. On rare occasions, pet parents may notice that their dog is walking sideways after grooming. For hairy dogs who were shaved, this could be a reaction to the unfamiliar feel of the breeze moving across their skin. Grooming can also involve holding up limbs in unusual ways or being put in awkward positions. For dogs with arthritis, this can result in muscle or joint soreness that affects their gait.\nIf you don’t recognize an obvious trigger for your dog’s sideways walking, you can check them over for causes. Things like scratches, burrs caught in hair, thorns in paws, or rocks between toes can all cause dogs to contort their bodies as they walk. If you’re not picking up on a reason for your dog to be walking sideways, get them checked out by your vet. It may be nothing, but it’s always better to be safe than sorry.\nMedical conditions causing sideways walking\nWalking sideways isn’t always normal for dogs. Some dogs can have a crabbing gait or sidewinding due to medical issues. Getting to the root of these problems may involve consultation with your primary vet or a veterinary surgeon or neurologist. Some possible causes for sideways walking in dogs include:\nMany neurological issues can causeloss of balance and incoordination. Some brain issues are lateralizing, meaning they affect one side of the body more than the other. This can result in a gait that leans or falls to one side consistently. Neurological issues can include congenital disorders like hydrocephalus, cerebellar hypoplasia, or caudal occipital malformation syndrome (COMS).\nHydrocephalus: Dogs with hydrocephalus have an excessive amount of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) where their brain should be. This condition has many possible causes but is most often due to improper drainage of CSF from the brain. Chihuahuas are one of the most commonly affected breeds.\nHydrocephalus: Dogs with hydrocephalus have an excessive amount of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) where their brain should be. This condition has many possible causes but is most often due to improper drainage of CSF from the brain. Chihuahuas are one of the most commonly affected breeds.\nCerebellar hypoplasia: The cerebellum is a part of the brain whose primary function is to control muscle function and balance. Some puppies can be born with anunderdeveloped cerebellumdue to prenatal issues like viral infections, lack of oxygen, or exposure to birth-defect-causing drugs or toxins.\nCerebellar hypoplasia: The cerebellum is a part of the brain whose primary function is to control muscle function and balance. Some puppies can be born with anunderdeveloped cerebellumdue to prenatal issues like viral infections, lack of oxygen, or exposure to birth-defect-causing drugs or toxins.\nCOMS: Also called a Chiari-like malformation or syringomyelia, COMS is a condition in which there is not enough space in the skull for the brain to fit. This results in compression of the back part of the brain (where the cerebellum and brain stem sit), leading to gait issues. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are particularly prone to this, though most flat-faced breeds are at risk due to their skull conformation.\nCOMS: Also called a Chiari-like malformation or syringomyelia, COMS is a condition in which there is not enough space in the skull for the brain to fit. This results in compression of the back part of the brain (where the cerebellum and brain stem sit), leading to gait issues. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are particularly prone to this, though most flat-faced breeds are at risk due to their skull conformation.\nAcquired neurological issues can result in sideways walking as well. Head trauma can result in either short-term or permanent gait abnormalities. Brain inflammation due to autoimmune diseases or infections can also cause dogs to have balance issues that result in crab walking. Infectious causes include conditions like toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, neosporosis, and tick-borne diseases.\nIdiopathic vestibular diseasein dogs is a common cause of balance loss. Dogs with vestibular disease usually have a head tilt and loss of balance. They will often roll or fall to one side. Idiopathic vestibular disease has no known cause (that’s what “idiopathic” means) and tends to show up in older dogs.\nVestibular disease can also be caused by middle- or inner-ear infections that cause inflammation of the ear structures that help control balance. Dogs with a loss of balance due to vestibular disease take days to weeks to return to normal, and they may walk sideways while they’re recovering.\nFor a dog with hip dysplasia, walking in a perfectly straight line maycause discomfort. Dogs with hip dysplasia often sway their hips when walking or have a bunny-hopping gait. When one hip is more painful than the other, this can result in an angled or sideways gait. Dogs with hip dysplasia also tend to shift as much weight as possible to their forelimbs to reduce movement of their hind limbs.\nThere’sa rubbery discbetween each of the bones of a dog’s spine. These discs serve as “bumpers” to help protect the bones from injury and allow the spine to move more freely. With wear and tear, the tougher outer part of a disc can weaken, allowing the softer material within to be squeezed out.\nThis material can press against the spinal cord, causing pain, inflammation, or damage to the cord itself. Disruption between a dog’s brain and nerves carrying the signals to the muscles can result in incoordination, which can show up as a crooked gait.\nAlso known asswimmer’s tail, rudder tail, cold tail, or frozen tail, this syndrome usually affects young (or young-at-heart), happy dogs.Limber tailoccurs most commonly after water activity (often the first of the season), crate confinement for transport, or prolonged exposure to cold or damp weather. The exact cause is unknown, but the muscles near the base of the tail acutely become very sore and painful.\nDogs affected by limber tail will walk around with a droopy, lifeless tail that is very painful. By itself, this doesn’t cause them to walk sideways, but some will hold their tail off to one side to avoid sitting on it or hitting it on things. This sideways pressure will cause their gait to be angled and can result in sideways walking.\nFound a tick on your dog? A veterinarian breaks down everything you need to know.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nVestibular disease describes any condition that causes a loss of balance due to changes in the balance center in the brain or middle ear. Dogs can develop vestibular symptoms due to deep ear infections or forunknown causes as they age.\nSigns of arthritiscan be subtle and may look like other orthopedic problems. Your vet can evaluate your dog for signs of pain or changes to their joints. Radiographs may be recommended to check any affected joints for arthritis.\nReferences:\nTextbook of Small Animal Orthopaedics: Chapter 91",

  "page_content": "Your dogbites at the forelegof another dog at the park. Aggression? No, it’s verylikely playful. A dog’s mouth is open, and they appear to be grinning. Plotting an attack? Nope, once again, it’s far more likely to be playful.\nOne dog is batting at another dog with their paws. Did they confuse this event with a boxing match? Not at all, because using their paws like this is a really common way to get play going with other pups. Elbows on the ground, behind up in the air, tail actively engaged? Having a good stretch? Well, however much it may resemble a stretch, in this context, it is almost surely playful. You may know that’s a play bow, but humans don’t understand most other play signals very well—whether our dog is displaying them for us or another dog. That’s unfortunate, because if we did, we would understand our pets so much better.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThe idea of a play signal — a behavior that requests play from a potential playmate or indicates that play is coming, is a great one. I mean, seriously, how great is it to have a way to communicate that you want to play and to invite someone to join? The following behaviors are good signs that your dog wants you to understand that they want the games to begin.\nPlay bow\nThe play bow is the best-known play signal and universally recognizable. This behavior consists of a dog placing their elbows and lower part of their forelegs on the ground while their back end stays up. The back often curves, the tail is frequently in a high position and wagging, and the forelegs are often turned out to form a “V,” rather than being parallel to each other.\nPlay bows frequently occur before dogs begin to play, and they also occur in between bouts of play, perhaps to ease tensions, make a hesitant dog more comfortable, or to keep play going longer. People can perform play bows to start play with their dogs, or even do a standing human version in which we bend our knees suddenly or even sort of hop into a partial squat and spread our arms out in a low V.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nPlay face\nThere’s a particular facial expression that is considered an invitation to play, and it is not unique to dogs; in fact, it is called the “mammalian play face.” It’s seen in many animals including canids and primates, and it was first described by Charles Darwin. In this expression, dogs have relaxed facial muscles, an open mouth that looks similar to a smile with slightly open jaws, and the lips pulled back sideways (not vertically).\nGently biting front paw of playmate\nDogs often initiate play by biting the front paw of a potential playmate. They don’t bite hard in this context but rather in a controlled, inhibited, gentle way. Many dogs respond to this play initiation attempt positively by mouthing back at the other dog, or starting to play with chasing or wrestling.\nMany humans become alarmed when a dog mouths at their arm and become angry or scared, and that’s why this play signal is not generally effective at initiating play with people. I prefer not to respond to this behavior by a dog with play because I generally like when dogs avoid having their teeth on my skin.\nBatting at a playmate with a paw\nBoxing or batting their front paws at a potential playmate is a common way to signal an interest in play. The play may continue with a lot of paw action or morph into another kind of play — wrestling, chasing, body slamming, or mouthing at each other’s faces. Some dogs commonly use this signal at the start of play but others don’t.\nEven dogs who don’t bat their paws at others tend to understand the meaning of this behavior. Most humans don’t, though, and that leads to a common communication failure between people and dogs. If a dog leaps up at a person, and the person attempts to stop this behavior by pushing the dog down with their hands, many dogs interpret this as a play signal andget even more jumpyand bouncy.\nThis often results in a person pushing at the dog but getting annoyed that the dog keeps jumping. Then, the dog will keep jumping, only to be confused and heartbroken that they’re being yelled at or grabbed roughly by the person. The poor dog! They understandably think the person wants to play but then become alarmed when the person seems angry with them for trying to play, too.\nThe internet has a lot to tell you about your new addition. Here’s what’s actually true.\nRolling over (in a particular way)\nAnother play signal involves a dog lowering themselves close to the ground and twisting their upper body so they are partly on their back with one shoulder, and then the other lands on the ground. They end up going belly-up just a split second later, right near the head of another dog. Sometimes after they roll over in this way, they then either bat their paws at the face of the other dog or give a very inhibited bite to the dog’s front paws.\nInitiating play without formal signals\nSometimes, dogs act in a particular way that seems to get play going, but they aren’t technically showing play signals. In these instances, it’s not so much that they are communicating their desire to play or assuring another dog that what follows is playful in nature, but rather they just act playful, and then the other dog joins in.\nOne way of initiating play without a formal play signal is to start a chase. A dog can do this either by running toward or away from the other dog. Here are some playful communications: If the dog runs in circles around the other dog; if they run with bouncy movements that are unlike the way dogs run when they are serious (serious meaning either running in the opposite direction to get away or running toward the other dog to attack); or they approach and then retreat from the other dog multiple times.\nAnother way that a dog can entice another dog to play is to hold a toy and wave it about near that pup or calmly approach and offer them one end of a toy that can be used toplay tug. If the other dog takes one end of the toy in their mouth, the first dog may wait a beat to make sure the other dog has a good grip on the toy and then begin to pull in earnest. In each of these cases, the playful intentions were obvious, and that’s important for avoiding misunderstandings.\nChase? Wrestle? Tug-o-war? Find out which are fair game.\nSkipping play signals\nPlay signals are essential in most cases but are sometimes skipped among regular playmates, especially within a household. Dogs who play together regularly, especially if they live together or see each other every day, sometimes don’t bother with play signals. It seems it is just assumed that the behavior is playful so there is no need to “say” so explicitly. It’s much like human siblings who suddenly leap out at each other to surprise or scare each other or suddenly start to wrestle — everyone understands that nobody is being attacked and that this apparently rough or aggressive behavior is actually playful. There’s no confusion because it is clearly intended to be in good fun.\nThe trouble comes when people who are used to skipping play signals with close friends or family members act the same way with other people, who don’t understand they are just playing. The person on the receiving end can become startled or alarmed. A person might jump onto their brother’s back unexpectedly, leading to a laugh and some wrestling, but if that same person jumps on the back of a random stranger, the responsemay be a fight, even if the leaper had playful intentions.\nThe same is true for dogs. They may be able to charge at and start wrestling with their best buddy, as they have done many times with everyone having fun. However, charging at and starting to wrestle with an unknown dog can lead to real trouble. The other dog might naturally seek to defend themselves from what they perceive as an attack.\nIn praise of play signals\nDogs are good at initiating play, and a big part of their process is using play signals to communicate that play is the plan.

Well, yes, they may be doing this to show you how much they love you, or they are asking for comfort in a stressful situation.

Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhy dogs lean on people\nMaybe you were gone all day at work or away on vacation. When you return, your dog is excited to see you; after jumping on you a few times, they lean their body weight into you. They are showing you how much they missed you and that they are happy you have returned. They may like to cuddle up on the couch at the end of the day and lean on you for love, affection, and petting. Some dogs can be very cuddly and affectionate!\nDogs lean on people for comfort, security, affection, expressing trust, and bonding. This behavior can also indicate a need for attention or reassurance, especially in new or stressful environments. Leaning is a natural, loving gesture that shows that your dog feels safe and connected with you.\nYour dog’s Velcro habits are cute—but not always convenient.\nDo dogs lean on you to show dominance?\nTypically, if your dog is leaning on you for attention, their personality will be showing a bit more than in other situations. If a dog is leaning on you for this reason, it may come across as more of a body slam when they lean their body against you, trying to get you interested in play — just like how they may do with another dog. Your dog may come over and lean on you with a ball or rope toy in their mouth, trying to engage you to grab it.\nYour dog also may lean or hide behind you when in a fearful situation (especially on leash if there is nowhere else to go). If your dog lacks confidence, they may be fearful in different situations and may react by hiding. Typically, if your dog is leaning because they are afraid, they will show other signs of fear, too. Some signs of fearfulness in a dog are:\nears back\nears back\ntail tucked\ntail tucked\ntrembling\ntrembling\nor lowering their head\nor lowering their head\nIf you notice these behaviors, it may be best to either leave the area or remove your dog from what they are scared of, until you can work on building their confidence around whatever is scaring them.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a shy pup to go from wallflower to social butterfly.\nCan dog leaning be a problem?\nDid the vet just walk into the exam room, and did your pup come over and lean on you? Your dog is looking for reassurance in this situation. They may feel uncomfortable because they remember what has happened at the vet’s office in the past. In this situation, it’s OK to comfort your dog and do your best to reassure them that everything will be fine.\nIf your dog has other great qualities on top of their tendency to lean on you to show their support, they may be the perfect candidate to become acertified therapy dog. A therapy dog differs greatly from an emotional support dog or service dog.\nOnce your dog passes the test and becomes a certified therapy dog, they can visit folks in a retirement home, hospital, school, library, and more. There, they will provide comfort for individuals who may have an illness or anxiety, and help comfort them in difficult situations.

  },
  "page_content": "Night after night, it’s the same. You get in from your evening walk, unclip the leash, and watch as the dinner show begins. Your dog is jumping around, barking and excited for the meal to come. Maybe it’s kibble, or maybe it’s fresh food, but whatever it is, they’re ready to chomp and chew until every last bite is gone. But at some point, in between pouring the food into their bowl and watching them lick up every last morsel, you start to wonder how much chow you’d have to pour into the bowl for them to realize enough is enough.\nCan dogs actually tell when they’re full, or are they simply eating machines with no sense of self control? We consulted with two veterinarians to dig into all of our questions about why dogs overeat.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nBloat is one of the leading causes of death in deep-chested dogs. This elective surgery can lower the risk.\nDo dogs know when they’ve eaten enough?\nIt turns out, the answer is a bit complicated. Dr. Wendy Mandese, a clinical professor of primary care and dentistry for the University of Florida’s College of Veterinary Medicine, tells us that just like people, “dogs have stretch receptors in their stomach that will send a satiety signal to the brain.”\nAt the same time, Dr. Claudia Kirk — a board-certified veterinary nutritionist and small animal internal medicine specialist who founded the University of Tennessee’s veterinary nutrition department — cautions in a separate email interview that the concept of being “full” is “a bit of a human description of becoming sated or meeting energy needs.”\nAccording to Mandese, “While some dogs can self-regulate when free-fed, many will overeat, and food left down can lead to resource guarding with other dogs.”\nThose of us who’ve caught our dogseating forbidden objects like socksknow firsthand that dogs are not always the most judicious about their dietary choices; it’s up to us to keep them safe.\nDon’t take it personally — even if that’s hard to do.\nWhy do dogs overeat?\nTo some degree, it’s in their nature. Dr. Kirk notes that dogs have been described as “bolt-feeders,” which means that they tend to wolf down their food so quickly that they bypass the signals that tell their body they’ve eaten enough. (If you’ve got a dog who eats too fast, we’ve gota few tipsthat can help.)\nJust like humans can eat so fast that we don’t notice our own physiological signals until it’s too late, dogs can (and, in some cases, are designed to) do the same.\nWhen you think about how dogs evolved over time, it makes sense; eating quickly would have been advantageous to dogs’ wild ancestors.“As scavengersand pack animals,” Dr. Kirk points out, “it is advantageous to gobble up your share of the food before your neighbor or a competitor comes to take it away.” Perhaps because of this, dogs tend to eat more in the company of other animals.\nThe type of food a dog receives can contribute to overeating as well, Dr. Kirk says. Some dog foods are so energy dense that dogs who consume them can wind up taking in more calories than they initially realize. In other cases, the food might be so tasty that dogs (again, like humans) simply cannot help themselves. Offering a variety of foods at mealtime can encourage a dog to overeat for the same reason.\nDrs. Kirk and Mandese both note that a dog’s medical conditions could play a role in their dietary habits. Some medications and diseases, like hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing’s disease), can stimulate an increased appetite. If you notice a significant increase or decrease in your dog’s appetite, Mandese suggests consulting with a veterinarian to rule out any possible underlying conditions.\nAnd finally, there’s the element of human error. Often, dogs’ over-indulgent eating habits can stem from loving pet parents who “overfeed their dog as a sign of affection and may not recognize their pet is becoming overweight or obese over time,” Dr. Kirk says.\nA dog food measurement by any other name would be confusing.\nAre some dog breeds more likely to overeat than others?\nAccording to Dr. Mandese, overeating is not related to any specific breed. Beyond the usual contributing factors, overeating likely has more to do with your dog’s personality and previous experiences with food security.\n“Previous starvation or the need to compete for food may cause dogs to eat more than necessary in preparation for future deprivation of food,” she says.\nHow does overeating affect dogs’ health?\nChronic overfeeding can lead your dog to become overweight or obese. Per Dr. Kirk, dogs withweight management issues aremore prone to health problems including arthritis and mobility issues, cancer, heart disease, urinary tract disorders, skin infections, and breathing difficulty. They’re also at risk for a shorter life expectancy.\nDogs who normally eat a healthy amount but suddenly consume way too much food might face more acute symptoms including vomiting, regurgitation (aka, throwing up undigested food —yummy), or diarrhea. They could refuse food, begin panting or pacing, or feel bloated and lethargic. In some cases, they may refuse food altogether.\nIn more severe cases, Dr. Kirk warns, sudden overeating can cause life-threatening disorders like pancreatitis, GI Bloat, and/or or gastric torsion — also known as agastric dilation and volvulus(GDV).\n“A GDV is an acute emergency,” Dr. Kirk warns. “It is more typical in large breed dogs.  While many dogs will develop a GDV without overconsumption of food, feeding practices and sudden access to a large volume of food may predispose dogs to this condition.”\nThe key to curbing mindless snacking — this is for your dog.\nWhat should I do if my dog has overeaten?\nDr. Kirk advises that pet parents whose dogs begin showing the symptoms listed above should seek veterinary advice.\n“It is important to remember that some of the consequences like GDV and pancreatitis are deadly and need immediate treatment,” she says. “The best course of action is to avoid overfeeding by feeding an appropriate amount to the dog’s age, breed, and energy level. Control uncontrolled food access by closing cupboards, feed containers, garbage cans, or other sources of unlimited food.”\nHow do I stop my dog from eating too much?\nBoth Drs. Kirk and Mandese urge all pet parents to speak with their veterinarians to learn how many calories their dogs should actually consume each day and come up with a feeding plan.\nYour dog’s ideal weight and nutritional demands will depend on their age, breed, gender, activity level, and lifestyle. “Keep in mind that calorie needs can change over time,” Dr. Kirk says. “Aging and a sedentary lifestyle will lower the calorie requirements, just like in people.”\nMandese advises that pet parents should divide their dogs’ caloric needs across two to three meals over the course of the day. Depending on your dog’s eating habits, she adds, you might want to adjust how you dole out their meals.\nAnd as tempting as it might be to feed your dog table scraps during holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, Dr. Kirk warns that overdoing it can have dire consequences. During these times of year, she says, “veterinary emergency rooms commonly seevery sick petsafter the pets overindulgence on fatty foods like turkey with skin, gravy, and other fatty foods.”\nLong story short: We all love to eat, but our dogs might struggle to know when enough is enough. It’s important for pet parents to pay attention to our dogs’ nutritional needs so that they can feast on everything life has to offer for as long as possible.",

Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nIf they’re following you around like your shadow, there’s a reason for that.\n7 reasons why your dog sits on you\nDoes your dog have anyfears or anxiety? Depending on the relationship you have built with them, you may help them feel safe. Dogs have been known to seek comfort from their parents when scared or uncomfortable. If your dog is scared, it’s OK to help them feel comfortable by petting them and allowing them to sit on you.\nDo you find your dog getting closer, looking at you with concern, or wanting to sit on you during a thunderstorm or fireworks or while at the vet? Your dog may be seeking a sense of safety and security. By consoling them, you will not make their fear worse. You can help them become more comfortable with whatever they are fearful of or uncomfortable with because they trust you.\nBonding with your dog is important to help build a healthy relationship. Having a great bond with your dog will make them easier to train and more likely to respond to the cues they have been taught. Typically, dogs will cuddle or sit on other dogs with whom they have a bond or feel comfortable, and this goes the same for their humans.\nAllowing your dog to sit on you and then cuddling them (if they enjoy that) is a great way to bond with them. Whenpetting your dog, you want to pet them in a way they enjoy. Your dog may sit on you because they love you and enjoy your company. Size doesn’t matter; be sure to make room for your large lap dog or your miniature snuggle pup.\nDogs like to get cozy, too. Depending on their size, the type of fur they have, or their breed, they may seek warmth or cuddles more than other dogs. Your Husky or Malamute may not enjoy cuddling or sitting on you because they get too warm. But Greyhound or Chihuahua may need the warmth of a jacket, blanket, or cuddle session to help keep them toasty and happy.\nWho doesn’t love sitting by the fireplace or under your favorite blanket? Some dogs may enjoy that, too, paired with sitting on their favorite human.\nJust like humans, dogs enjoy attention and interaction. Your dog may come over to sit on you when they are looking for attention or interaction. One way your dog may want to interact is by sitting on you during play, just like they might sit on one of their siblings. This is a great way to bond with your dog. Encouraging play can help build a stronger relationship with your dog. Find different ways that your dog enjoys playing, and engage with them in those ways.\nTypically, wolves are known to be animals that stay together with other wolves; they are not usually independent animals. Dogs are the same; most dogs like the company of others, whether it be another dog or a human.\nIf your dog is home alone most of the day, they may crave your attention and want to interact when you get home. Dogs don’t have a way of telling us they want a hug, so they may come over and sit on you to show they want your attention, especially if your attention is focused elsewhere after a long day.\nDogs may rub on you and sit on you to mark you with their scent, which often represents affection. They may be doing this to show you affection and that they are bonded with you and trust you.\nDogs can be creatures of habit, and they learn by repeating a behavior over and over. This is the same way you taught your dog to give a paw by being rewarded each time they completed the cue. Your dog can learn if they sit on you, they get what they want. Whether they want affection, play, or comfort, your dog may engage in this behavior because they have done it before and gotten their desired results.\nSome breeds are known to sit or lean on their humans. Bernese Mountain dogs are known for leaning on their parents, as well as anyone petting them. Being close to you brings a Bernese Mountain dog comfort. Vizslas are known to beextremely clingy dogswho love cuddling. Vizslas can suffer from separation anxiety if their needs are not met because this dog was bred to be with their parent at all times to participate in falconry.\nIt’s important to doyour research before selecting a dog based on how cuddly they are. Always be sure that you can fulfill all the needs of a dog you bring home. Next time your dog plops in your lap, be sure to remember this article, and get a better understanding of why they came to sit with you.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B.

They may begin to mirror how you feel and act in similar ways.\nIf your dog has imprinted on you, they have a special connection with you and may have a great recall (answering when called) or responsiveness. If your dog is responsive, they answer and follow almost all your cues well.\nYour dog may bark when other humans/dogs come near you or get aggressive toward another dog who wants you to pet them. If you notice these behaviors in your dog, it may be best to seek the help of a trainer. This behavior may become more serious and turn intoresource guarding.\nA dog with a strong attachment to one particular person may feel anxiety when separated from them. There are varying degrees of anxiety. Depending on the severity, it may be important to seek assistance from a trainer or veterinarian.\nIf your dog is exclusively bonded or attached to you, they may not listen to other caregivers. Dogs who have imprinted on someone become lifelong friends and will look to you for reassurance, love, or comfort.\nWhat to do when you don’t feel the close bond you want.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nDogs are social animals who love to spend time with their human companions.

  "page_content": "When I got my dog Georgie I had just turned 26 years old. My partner and I had only been together for 10 months, had very little expendable income, and exactly zero business adopting a pet at that point in our lives.\nBut there she was, with Golden Retriever ears that were too big for her face, Red Heeler markings (one of which looks exactly like a heart), and perpetually concerned Cocker Spaniel eyes. And we were a family of three for five years. She was our girl. The OG (original Georgie). Our one and only baby. That was, until we met Charlie.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nA study found that millennials are choosing pets over kids. Here’s why.\nMy deaf dog is the best boy.\nOriginally known as Duke when we first adopted him, he was a seven-month-old, spindly little guy whose mother had been abandoned and rescued while pregnant. The first thing we noticed when we went to meet him and his foster was that he followed the other dogs at the park wherever they went. He never went off on his own and always stayed close to the pack, careful to follow their every move. And that, we found out, is because Charlie is deaf.\nCharlie — or Prince Charles (no relation, to beclear), Chuck, Charles Entertainment Cheese, or The Boy — as he is alsoaffectionately known in our household—  is what is referred to as “a double merle.”  This is what happens when two dogs with a spotted “merle” pattern on their coats — think Australian Shepherds — breed.To quotethe resource andadoption site Deaf Dogs Rock(DDR), where his foster, an American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter and dog trainer, initially found Charlie: “If two merle dogs are bred together, each puppy in the litter has a 25 percent chance of being born a double merle. A double merle inherits the merle gene twice.”\nThis double copy then results in a lightening effect, which means the resulting puppy will have a white coat and will lack pigmentation around their eyes and on their nose (it’s a whole high-school biology punnett square thing). And they will also likely be deaf or blind — or both.\nWe didn’t set out to get a deaf dog, but once we saw Georgie and Charlie interact, we knew he was the right second pup for us. Because of his deafness, he benefits from having a hearing sister who looks out for him, and as a Cattle Dog mix, she likes having a job. She’s his ears when he needs her to be.\nTo celebrateDeaf Dog Awareness Week, I spoke with DDR founder Christina Lee — who was inspired to start the organization in 2012, two years after adopting herdeaf BoxerNitro — about what we wish people knew about deaf dogs and other deaf pets. We also make the case for why you should adopt these animals, who are often surrendered to shelters, asovercrowding is on the riseacross the U.S.\nBut first, how to spot the early signs of hearing loss.\nThey are the best pals.\nGeorgie is a sweet girl, and she likes cuddles… on her own terms. If I don’t pet her enough during a Zoom meeting, she’ll grumble at me so loud that my boss once asked if the sounds were coming from a human being. But she’s not a snuggler. Charlie, though, is a classic Velcro dog (as deaf dogs tend to be). He wants to be as close to me as he possibly can; it’s comforting for him to feel someone next to him. Unlike Georgie, he can’t rely on his ears to pick up any startling sounds that would jolt him out of sleep. He relies on feel, so if I suddenly stand up, he snaps awake to see what I’m reacting to.\nHe sleeps like a human being with his head on my or my partner’s pillow and, because he can’t hear me, he needs to see me at all times. Yes, that does mean he occasionally pokes his head into the shower to make sure I’m still there and didn’t magically disappear into Narnia or something. Would I prefer to shower alone? Sure.\nBut I also feel pretty flattered by his devotion. He has the energy of a little kid who doesn’t understand romantic partnerships yet and says, “I want to marry Mommy.” The bonus? He’ll never grow out of that phase — I hope. “You do have to be OK [with] never having any personal space again, but it is so worth the sacrifice,” Lee tells me.\nRescuer Henry Friedman helped a disabled dog go from abandoned on the street to rocking a designer whip.\nThey can be just as easy to train as any other dog.\nIt’s important to remember that what makes dogs different don’t make them harder to train, necessarily. We train Charlie the same way we train Georgie, except with a slightly altered approach. With her, we use a clicker, so she can hear the “click” when she completes a task. Then we give her a treat. With Charlie, after he sits, comes, waits, etc., we just flick a thumbs up — more of a visual clicker. And then, of course, he gets a treat.\n“We don’t consider deaf dogs or deaf/blind dogs disabled. We think of them as differently abled,” Lee says. “They are just as easy to train and live with their human families as a hearing dog, and the training is very similar. My deaf dogs all excel in all their training classes, therapy classes, andagility classes.”\nShe adds that “the sky is the limit” if pet parents make a commitment to positive reinforcement training with their deaf dog and points to all the accomplished pupsfeatured on their site.\nPro tips on training your dog with the click of a button — literally.\nThey are a dog first — and should be treated as such.\nYour dog’s so-called disability does not define them. Lee says the reason so many dogs who are listed as having disabilities may have a harder time getting adopted is that people see the disability first. At Deaf Dogs Rock, Lee says they tend to lead with the adoptable dog’s breed and personality. Deafness is third on the list.\nThey aresosmart.\nGeorgie is our little honors student; we always joke that she’s that “actually” person in class who’s always correcting other kids when they get an answer wrong. But Charlie is just as smart. He knows several ASL signs, and through our training with him, we’ve learned a lot of ASL, too. But more importantly, he’s emotionally intelligent. He can tell when I’m having a hard mental health day and instantly checks on me, deploying his very best “Velcro” snuggle therapy as he sticks to my side for a couch cuddle.\nLee says the same things about the deaf dogs in her life, adding that deaf dogs have “super powers” because they are so tuned into their environments. “My deaf dogs can feel the vibration of the UPS truck a quarter of a  mile down the road way before my hearing dogs alert us,\" she says. “They can also sense darkness (like an empath), and they can recognize good people but also pick up on negative energy from bad people.”\nDogs have the ability to understand much more complex things than you give them credit for.\nThey may communicate differently—but that doesn’t make it wrong.\nBecause he can’t hear himself to regulate his own volume, my boy is a loud barker. This has led some fellow pet parents to interpret that as aggression. In reality, he’s simply playing and asking his pals to play along with him — he’s just loud about it.\n“It really is about educating people when it comes to your deaf dogs playing with new dogs,” Lee says, adding that it’s always helpful to give other dog parents a heads up by saying something like, “‘My dog is completely deaf and he sounds ferocious because he can't hear himself, but rest assured it is just his way of playing.’”\nAs much as I wish I didn’t have to do this and that everyone would automatically accept Charlie for who he is, it is my job to be his advocate in this world. And it’s the least I can do for my favorite person (he’s a human being; please don’t refute that).\nLee says that, before DDR dogs get adopted, it’s her team’s role to be their champions. Again, this starts with not focusing on their disabilities, but rather on who they are and the kind of family they need. “It is more important to advertise for a committed, loving forever home with someone who is really serious about daily positive reinforcement training and being the deaf dog’s advocate in every situation,” she says.\nIf they’re following you around like your shadow, there’s a reason for that.\nHelping them feel comfortable in their new home and family is so rewarding and joyous.\nAs settled as we were in our life with Georgie, Charlie completed our family. Lee tells me that the best part of having deaf dogs is seeing that “light bulb” go on in their heads when they learn a new sign or master something new. For me, it’s knowing that he feels safe with me and in our home. When he’s nuzzled up against me, he can sleep soundly with the knowledge that I’m protecting him. And I feel immense comfort from a companion who reminds me that external silence is valuable — especially when my mind is often full of nothing but anxious chatter.\n“We say that deaf dogs are like potato chips; you can’t just have one!” Lee says, and it makes perfect sense to me. Charlie is my first deaf rescue dog, but he’s certainly not my last. All it takes is opening yourself up to understanding a different way of training and of looking at the world. Unfortunately, many people don’t take the time to do this. Lee says that right now, DDR is seeing that hundreds of deaf dogs — most of them between the ages of eight months and 1.5 years old — are being surrendered at shelters.“Many times, it is because someone adopted a deaf dog and then didzerotraining/socialization and the deaf dogs end up being put outside on a chain or stuck in the backyard until the owners do an owner surrender and take them to the shelter.” She adds that there is a huge need for fosters of deaf or deaf and blind dogs right now, in addition to adopters. So, if I’ve done anything to convince you that a deaf dog would only make your family better (and I hope I did), please check out DDR’sadoptable dogsandeducational resourcesright now.\nReferences:\nWhat Is a Double Merle?",

  "page_content": "Dogs are synonymous with loyalty. Most would follow their parents to the ends of the earth. Mine obsessively follows me to the bathroom. But as loyal as they are, surely, sometimes, they’re skeptical of us, right? Or raise their eyebrows when we say they will get a treat if they come to us at the park but in fact we are fresh out? Are they little detectives who can suss out when we’re lying?\nThey certainly seem to be able to read human emotion. Astudy publishedearlier this year inAnimal Behavioursuggests dogs may haveevolved to understand human emotion. Researchers found that dogs showed more signs of stress (i.e., shaking, whining) when they heard the sound of a human crying than when they heard the sound of a person humming. They believeyears of domesticationmay have conditioned dogs to match the emotional state of their human companion.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nA2017 studyon how dogs respond to different human expressions found similar results: Looking at a human with an angry face triggered dogs to lick their mouths, a behavior associated with excitation and stress. Given their ability to sense negative emotional states, can dogs also sniff out a liar?\nResearch finds that your pup can smell when you’ve been doom-scrolling, and they get bummed out.\nResearchers used the Sally-Anne test for dogs.\nThe short answer is yes, dogs can pick up on whether they have been given false information.\nIn 2021, researchers from the University of Vienna studied whether dogs coulddistinguish between honest and deceptive people. They used a variation of theSally-Anne test, a psychological assessment evaluating social cognition and the ability to understand other people’s beliefs and perceptions. In the original experiment, researchers pose the below problem to children:\nSally hides a marble in a basket and leaves the room. While Sally is gone, Anne moves the marble from Sally’s basket and hides it in a box. When Sally comes back, where will she look for her marble?\nChildren under five, as well assome apes, often indicate that Sally would look for her marble in the basket where she originally hid it. Experts believe this shows an ability to anticipate the behavior of someone with a false belief. Although researchers from the University of Vienna anticipated dogs to behave similarly to apes or children under five, the results were a little different.\nFor their experiment, researchers trained 260 dogs to find hidden food in one of two covered bowls. A person, whom the dog hadn’t met, would touch the bowl with food and verbally indicate that there was food in that dish. After establishing trust with the new person, the dog reliably following their correct signaling, a new person was introduced.\nWith the dog present, the second person would move the food from one bowl to the other. In some instances, the first person was present and witnessed the switch; in others, the first person left the room, apparently unaware that the food moved. In both instances, the first person would indicate to the dog that the food was still in the now-empty dish.\nIf the first person left the room while the switch happened, half of the dogs would follow their incorrect advice and go to the now-empty bowl. However, if the first person witnessed the food being switched, about two-thirds of dogs ignored the person’s suggestion when they gestured to the now-empty bowl, going instead to the opposite bowl with food. In other words, they could sense when the person was not completely trustworthy.\nA studyconducted in 2014 found similar results: Dogs appear to make inferences about a person’s reliability, modifying future behavior depending on whether that person tells them correct or incorrect information.\nYou and your pup are on the same wavelength—seriously.\nSo, does that mean my dog knows when I sneak medicine into some cheese or trick them into going to the vet?\nThe short answer: probably not. As Becky Mathia, a certified dog trainer and adoptions manager with Kansas City shelterWayside Waifs, tells us, our dogs are often responding to our body language and tone of voice. However, they do learn from repetition. “If we consistently ‘fake them out’ or ‘lie to them’ they can pick up on that pattern, or get to the point where they are confused and not wanting to listen to us,” Mathia says.\nBrett Currie, Wayside Waifs Canine Public Training and Behavior Manager, also emphasized dogs’ ability to pick up on repeated cues. “Dogs do not have the capacity to think ‘I think they’re lying to me or tricking me,’ but they do pick up on patternsveryquickly,” Currie tells us, noting that dogs are also using their own senses and experiences when decision making. “Dogs have an incredible sense of smell,” she adds. “So, if they’ve associated the smell of a pill with something that tastes badly, it’s going to be difficult to get them to take it again.”\nIf your dog is hesitant to, say, eat a pill hidden inside a piece of turkey, that may have more to do with their ability to smell something they don’t like than their expertise in lie detection.\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nCandogslie?\nWhen it works to their advantage, they sure do.\nIn 2017,Animal Cognitionpublished a study on deceptive behavior in dogs. Results showed that dogs appeared to adjust their behavior, depending on whether they were working with a “cooperative” human partner or a “competitive” human partner. The dogs showed an ability to use tactical deception, leading a cooperative partner toward a food reward and a competitive partner away from it. In other words, dogs appeared to “lie” when it was in their best interest.\n“Dogs learn best when we are consistent with our training,” Mathia reminds us. “But we can do things to make the training fun and keep the dog interested!” If you’re worried about establishing trust with your pup, she suggests balancing tough training with multipleforms of positive reinforcement, like treats, walks, and playing outside.",

  "page_content": "We know what happens inour ownbrains when we gaze into a dog’s eyes — in non-scientific terms, it’s heaven on earth. Now, thanks to new research, we know that the relationship isn’t one-sided — and those ooey-gooey feelings of connection aren’t made up.A new studypublished inAdvanced Sciencefound that when dogs and humans stare into each other’s eyes, our brain activity actually syncs up.\nPrevious research has found that being “on the same wavelength” is a real thing; while socializing or working on an activity together, our neural activity cansync up with other peoples’— in fact, when we’re really enjoying a concert, ourbrain activity becomes similarto that of the musician’s. Similar syncing has beenfound in mice,bats,andmonkeys, and it has been shown to increase attention and thequality of social interactions.The latest research proves that this harmony doesn’t just happen between creatures of the same species; humans’ brains match up with our dogs, too.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThe study\nIn the study, ten Beagles were paired with ten unknown humans. The humans and Beagles both had electroencephalograms (EEGs) measuring their brain activity as they engaged in petting and mutual gazing.\nEspecially if you pet them.\n“We observed that interbrain correlations in frontal and parietal regions dramatically increased … during mutual gaze,” wrote Wei Ren, the study’s lead author. The brain activity was even more synced when humans both petandgazed at the dogs.\nThe more familiar with each other they were, the greater the connection. “The strength of the synchronization increases with growing familiarity of the human–dog dyad over five days,” Ren wrote.\nPrevious researchhas found that petting a dog increases activity in a human’s prefrontal cortex, which can help us improve our social skills, emotional regulation, and attention spans — but this is the first evidence that this increased brain activity is at work in a pup’s brain during bonding, too. So, give your pup a chin scratch and stare into those puppy eyes; it’s bonding, it’s good for both of your brains...and you were going to anyway, right?",

    "title": "Understanding Reactivity and Aggression in Dogs: Two Very Different Things",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/reactive-vs-aggressive-dog"
  },
  "page_content": "Historically, the term “aggression” was used broadly to encompass various troublesome behaviors which can be problematic, such as barking, growling,lunging, and snarling. Unfortunately, there is a lot of shame associated with having a dog who is labeled “aggressive.” It’s not as loaded a term as an “angry dog,” but it still makes many dog parents feel bad unnecessarily.\nThe introduction of the term “reactivity”  aimed to address this issue by providing a more neutral, less judgy label for certain behaviors. The term “reactivity” came about in part to assuage people’s shame about having an aggressive dog which is why some of the first uses of the word involved discussing “leash reactivity” which is essentially the same behavior that has long been called “leash aggression.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nReactivity refers to a response to a stimulus that is perceived as excessive or intense, while aggression traditionally involves behavior with the intent to harm. Many people consider the term “reactive” more appropriate for their dog, and are more comfortable using it. The fact is that dogs are either aggressive or reactive based on the descriptions above, but some dogs are accurately called both aggressiveandreactive. Rather than focusing on labels, try to focus on addressing specific behaviors, because aggressive dog training and reactive dog training involve the same skills and require the same knowledge to be successful.\nWhen your dog growls, they’re expressing their emotions. A study found that you’ll likely be able to understand what they’re feeling.\nWhat is reactivity?\nReactivity is frequently used to mean a response to a stimulus or a trigger that is over the top — usually based on big emotions, as we say these days. Part of the challenge of using the term “reactive” is that it requires us to determine whether a dog’s response to something is excessive, and that depends on many variables: what caused the dog to react, what a normal response would look like, and so on.\nThe idea is that a reactive dog is one who is responding to a stimulus in any way that is beyond what the situation calls for. That can include dogs who are so happy to see people or dogs, or a specific person or a dog (or even a toy) that they respond with excessive enthusiasm. It can also include dogs who get extremely aroused because of a negative emotional response when they see people or dogs (or even other animals, or if they hear certain sounds) and appear incapable of exercising the proper amount of self-control.\nReactivity is a subjective construction because it means a response to a situation or a trigger that is more intense than expected by a typical dog. So, a dog who barks when the doorbell rings but then stops and calmly greets the visitors would not generally be called reactive.\nHow to teach your pup to play nice.\nBut a dog who barks in response to the doorbell and slams their body into the door over and over while spinning, leaping, barking ever louder, and being inconsolable would reasonably be called reactive. These cases are not going to prompt much argument, but what about all the variation that’s in between these two extremes? It’s not easy to determine the line between behavior that indicates reactivity and typical canine behavior involving some level of excitement. Basically, the answer to “What is a reactive dog?” depends on who you ask.\nWhat is aggression?\nAggression is historically used to indicate something about intention, because a common definition of aggression is behavior with the intent to harm another individual. There are people who vehemently disagree with the inclusion of intent as a part of the definition of aggression because it is not possible to know for certain what a dog’s intention is. They prefer to look only at the behavior without ascribing any intent to the dog exhibiting the behavior. It’s a fair argument that it’s more useful to describe what a dog does than to label them an aggressive dog.\nSo, sometimes the definition is “any behavior that causes harm to another individual or threatens to.” An issue with this definition is that a situation that causes harm could also just happen from an accident a dog has, such as falling off a surface, like the couch, and scratching someone on the way down unintentionally or knocking someone over when greeting them exuberantly. Ugh — definitions are so hard!\nStep one: Never put your face close to theirs.\nAggression is just one of many types of behavior that fall under the category of “agonistic behavior,” which is any social behavior that relates to fightsor contests. The other ones are threats, displays, placating, and reconciliation. Threats, displays, and placating behavior can reduce tension and lower the likelihood of aggression.\nOver time, threats and displays have been lumped in with aggressive behavior by dogs, which means that some behaviors that may actually prevent harm to one dog (or a person) by another dog have been included in the category of aggression. That leads to a weird situation in which many of the behaviors we describe as aggressive in dogs are actually agonistic behaviors that have theintenttoreduceconflict and toavoidfighting.\nThe truth: Defining dog behavior is complicated.\nTrying to define all behavior precisely and accurately is inherently problematic because we are trying to overlay a simplistic form of clarity over the truly complicated nature of behavior. Definitions seek to make things simple and easy to understand, but that is really difficult because of how complicated behavior is, especially when conflict and arousal are involved.\nReactivity alludes to the emotional aspects of what is going on, and “aggression” more commonly refers to intent and to the possibility of injury. Many people find it frustrating that reactivity is so often confused with aggression, but that’s not surprising, given that the terms are not mutually exclusive. If you try to sort all dogs with certain types of undesirable behavior into those who are aggressive and those who are reactive, it’s impossible because you are trying to fit three categories of dogs into just two categories.\nExpert advice for people with dogs who jump, bark, and generally go nuts when people come over.\nSome dogs, based on a general understanding of the terms, are both reactiveandaggressive. Their emotions are over the top, and they may hurt someone. Others are just reactive. They are highly aroused and respond to other individuals in an intense way, but they never hurt them or try to hurt them. Andsome dogs are just aggressive, but not reactive. I’ve met dogs in this last category, though I think it is the rarest of the three groups. Those particular dogs may bite, and even cause a high level of damage, but they do so without any of the emotional arousal so typical of most scenarios. (Usually, a dog who bites iseither fearful— this is the most common emotional state of dogs who bite — or frustrated or in a high state of arousal.) Dogs who seem emotionless when they bite and exhibit no emotion after the bite remind me of movie depictions of hit men. I picture them saying, in their dog language, “This is not personal. It’s just business,” before they seriously injure someone with a bite.\nI tend to recognize the term aggression the way that most people who book appointments with me use the term — to indicate any behavior that gives them a bad feeling that someone could get hurt by the teeth of their dog. That refers to all the barking,growling, lunging, cold stares, tooth displays, nips, air snaps, and bites.\nYou can’t reliably distinguish aggression and reactivity based on body language alone. Both aggressive and reactive dogs can bark, lunge, growl, run, tuck their tales, leap around, cower, exhibit piloerection, pin their ears, show their teeth, or give a fear grimace, among other behaviors.\nAggression has to do with intent and injury, but also relates to conflict resolution, and reactivity has to do with excessive arousal, but reactivity and aggression are not mutually exclusive. Arousal is one cause of aggression and a dog who is reacting excessively fearfully can behave in an aggressive manner because of their fearfulness.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nFocus more on the behavior, less on the label.\nI know it’s a wild dream that will never come true, but it would be my preference to focus on the behavior and avoid labeling it. Labels have value for brevity and ease of communication, but so much is lost when we group large numbers of dogs into a small number of categories because of a desire to define behavior. Additionally, without any clear consensus on what these terms mean, clarification is always needed when we communicate with one another, and when someone uses either of these terms. Rather than say a dog is aggressive or a dog is reactive, I like to say, “This dog barks and lunges atunfamiliar peoplewho she sees while on leash” or “This dog bites people who reach for him.”\nAn emphasis on describing the behavior rather than defining it avoids the confusion that can arise when the terms “aggressive” and “reactive” mean different things to different people.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nAll dogs, including those who arereactive and aggressive(or both), should be trained with positive reinforcement and patience. Set dogs up for success, have reasonable goals, and use management to keep everyone safe and relaxed.\nThe knowledge and skills of professional behaviorists and trainers are assets when working to improve the behavior of any dog, but are essential for appropriate safety measures and good progress with aggressive and reactive dogs.\nSeek professional help from a qualified canine behaviorist or dog trainer, and consult with your veterinarian to rule out medical causes if you have had the very distressing experience of your dog biting you.\nReferences:\nBehavioural Testing For Aggression in the Domestic Dog\nBehavioural Testing For Aggression in the Domestic Dog\nFactors Associated With Aggressive Responses in Pet Dogs\nFactors Associated With Aggressive Responses in Pet Dogs\nUnderstanding Dog Aggression: Epidemiologic Aspects: In Memoriam, Rudy de Meester (1953-2012)\nUnderstanding Dog Aggression: Epidemiologic Aspects: In Memoriam, Rudy de Meester (1953-2012)\nAn Overview of Types of Aggressive Behaviour in Dogs and Methods of Treatment\nAn Overview of Types of Aggressive Behaviour in Dogs and Methods of Treatment\nManaging the Risk of Aggressive Dog Behavior: Investigating the Influence of Owner Threat and Efficacy Perceptions\nManaging the Risk of Aggressive Dog Behavior: Investigating the Influence of Owner Threat and Efficacy Perceptions",

  "page_content": "Dogs are loyal companions, enthusiastic tail-waggers, and occasional couch thieves. They’re also master communicators, using barks, tail wags, soulful stares, body language, and whining to express their emotions. Sometimes, those soft, high-pitched sounds are endearing. Other times, whining can be annoying, especially when you don’t understand how to interpret what your dog is trying to say.\nBefore you start looking for dog psychologists, take a deep breath. Whining is a sign that your dog needs attention — not necessarily an emergency, but something worth addressing. Here’s a breakdown ofwhy dogs whine, what you can do to ensure you don’t get a headache, and that your pup is well-understood and cared for.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents.

They may be hungry, bored, or need pets and affection. If whining gets a reaction from you — even a frustrated one — they’ve learned that it works.\nWhining can be a way for dogs to tell you that something hurts. According toDr. Alisha Kidwell, an experienced and reliable veterinarian at North Carolina’s Cabarrus Animal Hospital, persistent whining often indicates discomfort or pain. Schedule a trip to the vet if your dog’s whining seems unusual, and they are limping, licking a particular spot, or showing signs of distress.\nSometimes, whining is a dog’s way of making a polite request. Do they need to go outside? Do they want a treat from the cookie jar? If your dog stares at you while whining, they need you to decipher their canine code.\nLoud noises, unfamiliar environments, and new people or animals in the house can trigger whining. This is how dogs can express anxiety, and sometimes whining indicates unease. They feel stressed, anxious, or fearful if their ears are pinned back or their tails are tucked.\nA bored dog is whinier than average. If your dog lacks mental or physical stimulation, they may whine because they have nothing better to do. It is their version of asking you to play or do something with them.\nIf your dog starts whining when you leave the room or house, they may have separation anxiety. Dogs with this condition whine excessively. They may pace or become destructive when alone because all their energy is focused on how they feel when separated from you.\nNot all whining is negative. Sometimes dogs whine because they feel excited. Their body language expresses excitement, such as joyful eyes and a wagging tail. They are letting you know they can’t wait for whatever comes next.\nIt’s the saddest sound in the world.\nWhat to do about excessive whining in dogs\nSome dogs are dramatic, using whining to test the patience of the most loving pet parents. The key to restoring peace in your home is to discover why your dog is whining. Remember, whining is a dog’s way of communicating, so your job is to pay attention to the pitch and body language to figure out why they’re expressing themselves this way.\nThere are practical ways to manage and minimize whining. You can turn whining into a manageable method of communication by ruling out medical concerns, paying attention to patterns, and setting clear boundaries.\nContact a veterinarian to rule out health problems. If your dog’s whining is sudden, unusual, or paired with symptoms like a change in appetite or lethargic behavior, there could be something medically amiss.\nWhen, where, and why is your dog whining? Are they whining near their food bowl at dinnertime? Are they sitting by the window and whining at the neighbors? Pay attention to your dog’s behavior and body language. Context clues can help you decode their whining.\nSome whining deserves immediate attention (like if they are in pain or need to go outside). Other times, whining is less urgent, like when your dog is begging for leftover sandwich crusts while you’re eating lunch. Learn to prioritize so you don’t spend your day catering to your dog’s demands.\nHold off for a few minutes if your dog is whining for attention. Don’t give in immediately. Wait until they calm down, then reward them with praise, treats, and affection. This teaches them that silence and peace — not whining — earn your attention and positive response.\nTired dogs are typically quiet and peaceful. Daily walks, playtime, and mentally stimulating toys can help burn off excess energy, reducing the risk of whining out of boredom. A bored dog is a toddler on a sugar high. Keep them busy, and they will whine less.\nTo pet parents, awhimpering dog sounds as sad as a crying baby. Here’s why.\nWhen should you work with a professional trainer for help?\nIf your dog’s whining stems from issues like fear or anxiety, a professional trainer can help. They can assist with tackling the root cause of the whining — not just the symptoms. Think of it as therapy for your pup and peace of mind for you.\nTrainers can teach you tools and techniques to better understand and communicate with your dog. They help you foster a stronger bond and more precise boundaries, whether helping your dog build confidence or learning self-soothing behaviors. Professional guidance can make a difference byteaching your dog(and you) to unlearn habits that may be distressing or triggering, contributing to whining.\nProfessional dog trainers often spot subtle cues or triggers you may otherwise overlook. They can help you address whining issues more effectively, setting up you and your pup for long-term success.\nFAQs\nSometimes. You should ignore a whining dog when they are begging for attention, and you’re sure nothing is immediately wrong. Ignoring them teaches them that whining won’t work to get your attention. However, if they’re in pain, scared, or requesting something (like going outside), don’t ignore them —address the issue.\nSome dog breeds are more vocal than others. For instance, Siberian Huskies, Beagles, and Dachshunds are notable chatterboxes, and whining is part of their reputations. However, they can be trained to stop whining unless something is wrong.\nIf whining is sudden, excessive, or paired with symptoms like limping, vomiting, or lack of appetite, it’s cause for concern. Your vet will help you figure out if something is wrong.\nReferences\n“Why Is My Dog Whining So Much All of a Sudden – [Vet Explains Pets].”Vetexplainspets.com, 2024,vetexplainspets.com/why-is-my-dog-whining-so-much-all-of-a-sudden.

  },
  "page_content": "Fireworks?Very scary, obviously. Thunderstorms? Not great. Big delivery trucks? Same deal. As a dog parent, you’ve probably identified a few things that clearly trigger a stress reaction in your pup. But some common sources of stress for our dogs may not be so obvious. How our dogs experience the world can be very different from our interpretations of the world, so some things we perceive as normal or inconsequential might actually be very stressful for our pets.\nFor your dog’s short-term happiness and long-term health, it’s important to understand what stresses your dog out and how to mitigate that anxiety. We spoke with Fanna Easter, a professional dog trainer and a member of the APDT Board of Directors, and veterinary behaviorist Dr. Margaret M. Duxbury about various ways you might be stressing out your dog without realizing it.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nHow to cope with dog anxiety—from training to medication.\nCommon stress triggers for dogs\nWhen we experience stress, it can impact our mood, behavior, and relationships. The same goes for dogs.\n“None of us respond the best when we’re stressed,” Duxbury says. “We don’t bring our most rational selves to people or the environment…[Stress] sets the dog up not to do as well as they could.”\nWhen dogs experience stress — especially “trigger stacking,” or when multiple stressful or scary events “stack” on each other in a short period of time — it can cause them to act out, sometimes with uncharacteristic aggression, such as snapping or biting.\nThanks, they hate it.\nIt’s important to learn to recognize stress in your dog and know when it is necessary to take action to reduce that stress. Here are some things that might be stressing your dog out more than you expect:\nDogs have independent emotional lives, Duxbury says, and they form their own unique relationships with different people and pets. Just because someone is your best friend, doesn’t mean they’re your dog’s best friend, too.\nSometimes, the new person in your home is a baby or child. Even if your dog tolerates a newborn well, their stress levels might rocket when that toddler becomes mobile. Duxbury advises taking things slow and gradually acclimatizing your dog toa new baby, friend, or animal in the household.\nThe same rules apply when you’re out in public. Easter notes that people often insist on petting dogs they see — whether they know that dog or not. This can be especially stressful for more reserved dogs.\n“If your dog doesn’t want to be pet,” Easter says. “Ask (insist if needed) a person to ignore your dog and stand six feet away.”\nWhat might seem like a clear cue to us (“sit!”) might not be so obvious for our dogs.\n“People really underestimate how dogs read people,” Duxbury says. “Just minute changes in your posture… affect the quality of signal or cue you’re giving the dog.”\nIn other words, if the cue you’re giving (i.e., “Come!”) and body language (i.e., stern voice, aggressive posture) don’t match, it might confuse your dog. Duxbury, who advocates for reward-based training, says the same is true when you respond authoritatively when your dog does something wrong. Correction-based training doesn’t provide your dog with enough information on what they did wrong or how they should react instead, she says, which can also cause stress.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nWhile taking your dog for a walk is generallygood for their health, there are a few exceptions. For example, Easter says you should never force your dog to go on a walk if they appear stressed. If your dog pulls to go home, barks at other dogs, and/or displays other anxious behavior, listen to their needs and return home, she advises.\nWalking by barking dogs can also be extremely stressful. “No one wants to walk near someone screaming obscenities toward them, so why do we insist dogs should walk near dogs barking aggressively at them?” Easter says. “Change directions, and avoid that spot in the future.”\nWhile you might want to include your dog in all your fun weekend plans, our experts say it's best to consider what the experience really might be like for your dog. Duxbury says crowded locations such as farmers’ markets or breweries can be extremely stressful for all except the most social dogs. “They’re just looking at kneecaps and feet coming at them,” Duxbury adds. If you want to bring your dog to a brewery, try less crowded days and times, or sit on the periphery where it’s less busy.\nThe same goes for dog-oriented events and locations, such as dog parks. “There are huge expectations that your dog will be social with a bunch of other dogs they’ve never met,” Duxbury says. “Some dogs are. But some dogs aren’t, and they don’t bring their best selves to the dog park because it’s stressful.”\nFireworks and thunderstorms aren’t the only things that make them say,“No, thanks!”\nHow to recognize stress in your dog\nThe first step to supporting your dog is to learn how to recognize when your dog is starting to feel anxious or overwhelmed. The key here is to pay close attention to your dog’s body language. Here are a few signs to look out for that might indicate your dog is feeling stressed:\nExcessive yawning, panting, or lip licking\nExcessive yawning, panting, or lip licking\nWhale eye — when you see the whites of your dog’s eye\nWhale eye — when you see the whites of your dog’s eye\nLooking away\nLooking away\nPacing\nPacing\nCowering, trembling, or backing away from a situation\nCowering, trembling, or backing away from a situation\nPay attention to whether your dog’s stress is building.

There are alsoseveral resourcesout therethat can help you identify body language in your dog that shows they are not OK.\nBoundaries, folks. Boundaries.\nCreate a stress-free zone\nThere is no one-size-fits-all solution to relieving anxiety for dogs. However, there are several things you can do to make your home feel like a safe space. Consider the following:\nFollowpositive reinforcement training: Both of our experts recommend seeking out a positive reinforcement behaviorconsultantortrainer. “Many [pet] guardians focus on symptoms (barking, hiding, hyperactivity) as a stressor when anxiety is usually the main cause,” Easter says. “Expert help is needed to clearly define the cause for anxiety and how to address the issue.”\nFollowpositive reinforcement training: Both of our experts recommend seeking out a positive reinforcement behaviorconsultantortrainer. “Many [pet] guardians focus on symptoms (barking, hiding, hyperactivity) as a stressor when anxiety is usually the main cause,” Easter says. “Expert help is needed to clearly define the cause for anxiety and how to address the issue.”\nGive your dog a safe space and comfy bed: If your dog doesn’t get along well with strangers, make sure they have a safe place in your bedroom to relax with food, water, and toys. If your dog isn’t allowed on your bed or furniture, Duxbury says to make sure your dog bed passes the “princess and the pea” test: If you pinch your dog bed and can feel your fingers rubbing together, then it’s too thin.\nGive your dog a safe space and comfy bed: If your dog doesn’t get along well with strangers, make sure they have a safe place in your bedroom to relax with food, water, and toys.

Help them, and listen to their needs.”\nDuxbury agrees, emphasizing that part of our duty as dog parents is to care for the emotional and mental well-being of our pets. “So much depends on trust and being able to count on your partner,” she says. “It’s really you and your dog against the world.”\nResources:\nFamily Paws Resources\nFamily Paws Resources\nHow to Tell If Your Dog Is Stressed\nHow to Tell If Your Dog Is Stressed\nStress in Dogs\nStress in Dogs",

  "page_content": "Have you ever noticed your dog yawning excessively and wondered if it’s just a sign of tiredness? While yawning is a common behavior in dogs, there are various reasons, such as stress or pain, as to why they may be doing it more frequently than usual.\nLike most behaviors in dogs, yawning is a form of communication. The function of a dog yawning may be a physiological or emotional function. Yawns can happen due to physiological tension or mild stress.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat does it mean when a dog yawns?\nDog yawns can have a few different meanings. When interpreting why your dog yawns, it is important to observe what is also happening around them. The yawning behavior in dogs can be physiological, meaning the yawn happens as a normal function in the dog’s everyday actions.\nJust like us, dogs do yawn when they are feeling tired or drowsy or are just waking up from a nap.\nYour dog might yawn to show they are uncomfortable in a situation, otherwise known as displacement behavior. That could mean someone or something around them is making them uneasy.\nA yawn is one of the first signs your dog is stressed. According to theDog Ladder of Communication, yawning is at the bottom and one of the first subtle signs of stress. As you continue to put pressure on a dog, they may begin to move up the ladder, potentially ending at the highest level, a dog bite.\nDoes your dog yawn when you come in for a hug or get in their personal space? They are telling you that they do not enjoy what is happening and would like more space. You may also see your dog yawn at the vet, which is another stressful situation. When your dog is excessively yawning and showing other stress indicators, you might want to assume they are stressed or feeling fearful of a situation. They may also have their tail tucked, be cowering, have their ears back, or showing the whites of their eyes.\nAnother reason your dog may yawn is when they are in pain. Excessive yawning paired with other behaviors like whimpering, licking, or limping may indicate that they are hurt and are in need of medical attention.\nInterpreting your dog’s yawns\nTo understand why your pup is yawning, you’re going to want to look at a few factors. They are responding to what is happening around them, so they’re most likely not yawning for no reason.\nWhat is the environment in which this is happening? The way your pup acts is an indicator of what they are feeling and how stressed they may be. If they are acting anxious while they around an excitable child, for example, this could be an indicator they are not comfortable around kids.\nThe other stress signals that accompany the yawns may help you determine your dog’s wellbeing and how you should address the situation. First, as a dog parent, it is important to learn what dog body language is and what those behaviors mean. Once you know what those behaviors are, you can be on the look out for when your dog displays them, this will help you better care for them.\nSome ways that you can help your dog in an event that they are stressed: Start by avoiding a situation you know will be stressful for your dog, i.e., leave them at home from theFourth of July barbecue. Sometimes, you can’t avoid a stressful situationlike the vet. Typically, vets are very supportive and helpful when it come to fearful animals. Many vets will allow you to pop into the waiting room on days you don’t have an appointment and get some yummy treats; this will help set up a positive association.\nTo figure out the source of your pup’s yawns, you might want to keep notes, logging every time they yawn. This way, you can keep track of what might be triggering this behavior so you can work to avoid those situations.\nIf you find that your dog is stressed often, it may be best to work with a veterinarian and dog trainer to help figure out the best treatment. Sometimes, dogs with serious anxiety may benefit from the use of medication to help them feel calm. Yawning is a common behavior in dogs and should be interpreted appropriately to help them live a happy and healthy life.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nThere are a number of reasons why dogs might yawn. These can include physiological responses, such as yawning as theyfall asleepor upon waking up.\nYes, dogs may yawn when stressed. Yawning is often one of the first signs that a dog is stressed, and is a subtle sign for you to change your dog’senvironment or your behavior.\nYour dog might be yawning frequently due to stress, pain, or exhaustion.\nReferences:\nCanine Ladder of Aggression or Communication\nCanine Ladder of Aggression or Communication\nContagious Yawning in Domestic Dog Puppies (Canis Lupus Familiaris): the Effect of Ontogeny and Emotional Closeness on Low-Level Imitation in Dogs\nContagious Yawning in Domestic Dog Puppies (Canis Lupus Familiaris): the Effect of Ontogeny and Emotional Closeness on Low-Level Imitation in Dogs\nFamiliarity Bias and Physiological Responses in Contagious Yawning by Dogs Support Link to Empathy\nFamiliarity Bias and Physiological Responses in Contagious Yawning by Dogs Support Link to Empathy\nWhy Do Dogs Yawn?\nWhy Do Dogs Yawn?",

  },
  "page_content": "For as much time as we spend gazing into our dogs’ sweet puppy eyes, it can be hard for us to tell what’s actually going on in those adorable noggins. We know that dogs are pretty clever; we wouldn’t have to spell out “W-A-L-K” and “O-U-T” if they didn’t havesomesocial awareness, after all. But exactly how deep does their knowledge of language go — and how long can they remember a word once they’ve learned it?Ina new studypublished inBiology Letters, researchers explored the long-term memory abilities of dogs and found that some dogs can remember the names of toys that they haven’t seen in two years.\nDogs remember the names of their toys\nThe study included five gifted word learner (GWL) dogs. Gifted word learner dogs are pups who are able to learn object labels —these smartiescan learn over 100 words (Chaser, a Border Collie who’s pretty much the Einstein of the dog world,learned over 1,000, but he’s an outlier).\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nEach of the dogs were able to learn the names of 12 toys over one week. The toys were then stored out of the dogs’ reach for two years. One day before the test, the dogs were given back each of the toys at once and allowed to investigate them.\nOn the day of the test, six randomly selected toys were placed on the floor along with eight other toys from the dogs’ toy inventory. The pet parents then asked their dog to retrieve a toy based on the name the dog had learned two years earlier. Each toy was requested twice.\n“Our findings show that, after initial consolidation, most of the GWL dogs tested in this study maintained the object-label mappings over a two-year time period, without any further rehearsal,” wrote the study’s lead author, Shany Dror. Four out of the five dogs were able to remember the names of between three and nine toys.\nYep, your dog remembers that you didn’t take them out for a walk yesterday.\nWhy these findings matter\nThe results of the study show that dogs don’t just retain information through their pet parents repetitively refreshing their memories; they actually learn names and store the labels in their long-term memory. The researchers guess that results would have been even better if the dogs had been exposed to fewer labels to begin with and given more time to learn each name.\n“In humans, high performance in verbal memory tasks has been associated with high-performance in other memory tasks, such as visuospatial memory and autobiographical memory, and other cognitive domains, such as executive functioning,” Dror wrote. They hope to explore further research on dogs to find if an advanced verbal memory also correlates with other cognitive abilities.\nLearning about how dogs’ memories work can help us understand our own memories and language acquisition, too. “Why is language uniquely human? To understand that, we need to understand what parts of language are available in other animals and which parts are not,”Dror toldThe Guardian.\nThey add the caveat that since not all dogs are able to learn object labels the way these gifted word learners are, the results don’t necessarily apply to all dog populations.\nResearchers also found that the dogs with the sharpest memories were the ones whose pet parents were able to spend the most time practicing the original labels with them. “The more you invest in your dog, the more you will get back from the relationship,” Dror toldThe Guardian.",

    "title": "To Cry Is Human—and Apparently Canine",

  "page_content": "We treat our dogs like (very cute) people — when it looks like they’re smiling we coo over how adorable it is. When they put their heads in our laps, we feel the love. When they cry actual tears, we...wait, what? That’s a thing? Apparently, it is.\nTakefumi Kikusui’s Standard Poodle was nursing her puppies six years ago when he observed the Poodle’s eyes welling up with tears. The tears didn’t roll down her face as they do when humans cry, but her eyes were clearly wet. Her face looked different because of the tears, and it seemed to happen whenever she was nursing her puppies. In addition to being a dog parent, Dr. Kikusui is a faculty member in the Department of Veterinary Medicine at Azabu University in Azabu Saitama, Japan.As with so many great studies in science, the original idea for Kikusui’s most recent published study, “Increase oftear volume in dogsafter reunion with owners is mediated by oxytocin” was based on an observation — in this case, the teary eyes of his nursing Poodle. In a study exploring the connection between emotions and the production of tears in dogs, he and his fellow researchers came to three important conclusions.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nDogs produce tears when reuniting with their owners after a separation of many hours.\nDogs tear up more when reuniting with their parents than with other humans they know. The amount of tearing up observed during reunions with parents is also more than the amount produced when dogs are just hanging out with their parents at home. The increase in canine tears when people reunite with their dogs suggests an emotional cause of the tears.\nEmotions both sad and happy (and even those of rage and frustration) can make humans cry. Everybody knows that’s a thing. What makes this new research such a big deal is that it’s the first study showing a connection between emotion and tears in another species.\nAlthough the increased tear production is small, it is noticeable. Kikusui emphasized that it was a difference in visual appearance that prompted his research in the first place: “If the owners are sensitive, they can recognize it. Initially, my female Standard Poodle got pregnant, and she gave milk to the puppies (meaning higher oxytocin secretion), her eyes were shining, and [her] face became cuter; we recognized it and started this experiment.\nWhat to do when you don’t feel the close bond you want.\nThe “love hormone” oxytocin causes the production of tears in dogs who are feeling happy.\nOxytocin applied to dogs’ eyes results in more tears than when a control substance of a similar peptide is applied to the eyes. Oxytocin — famously called the “love hormone” — plays a huge role in romantic relationships, the bonding of mothers and babies,andthe strong bond between people and dogs.\nOxytocin promotes feelings of love and tranquility. Petting dogs and caring for them increase oxytocin levels in both people and dogs. Nursing also causes the release of oxytocin, which is why Kikusui says it was seeing his dog’s tears while nursing her puppies “that gave [him] the idea that oxytocin might increase tears.”\nThat oxytocin may be the cause of the tears further supports the idea that dogs are producing more tears in response to their emotions.\nApparently wild dogs can be pretty cute, too.\nPeople feel more love and compassion toward dogs with misty eyes.\nPhotos of dogs with artificial tears prompt more desire in humans to take care of them than photos of dogs without those tears. People responded more positively to misty-eyed dogs, which means it makes sense for dogs to produce them. When tears lead to love, nurturing, and possibly steak, the tendency for tears to form in response to the beloved people will increase — that’s just the way evolution works.\nEye contact has already been shown to enhance our relationship. Gazing at one another leads to increased levels of oxytocin, which leads people to take care of dogs. This increases oxytocin levels, and the positive feedback loop continues. This experiment suggests that the extra tears, shown to prompt more loving feelings and the urge to care for the dogs who have such tears, may be the stimulus that leads to increased oxytocin and increased feelings of love in people when they lovingly look at dogs.\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nDogs shed tears of joy.\n“We found that dogs shed tears associated with positive emotions,” Kikusui says. “Their tears might play a role in the deepening of mutual relationships and further leading to interspecies bonding.”\nThe idea that dogs cry happy tears is new information. Prior to this study, there was no evidence connecting canine tears to feelings. If the thought of your dog’s tears stemming from happy emotions has your eyes glistening even a little, you can thank science for a deeper understanding of true love!\nReferences:\nIncrease of Tear Volume in Dogs After Reunion With Owners Is Mediated By Oxytocin",

  "page_content": "On a good day, you come home smiling, maybe even singing that Chappell Roan song you’ve had stuck in your head for months. You’re happy. Your dog comes running up to you, tail wagging, taking on your cheerful mood.\nOr you come home from the worst day at work and instantly flop onto the couch to have a cathartic cry. As your face scrunches up and tears start to flow, you feel something gently tap one of your heaving shoulders. It’s your dog, just placing a paw on you, as if to say,I’m here. It’s OK.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nDogs have an uncanny ability to connect with humans, often seeming to read our emotions easily. But do they really know what is going on in your head? Here’s what researchers found about their ability to discern different facial cues, how they respond, and what you can do as a dog parent to improve communication with your pup.\nIf they’re following you around like your shadow, there’s a reason for that.\nCan dogs understand facial expressions?\nThe short answer is: yes. Dogs pay attention to human facial expressions. A 2021study foundthat dogs can distinguish between happy and angry human faces. They use their memories of real emotional human faces to identify both feelings. Pups prefer smiling faces to sad ones, suggesting they might understand who might be a friendly presence in their lives.\nVeterinarian Dr. Kathryn Dench, the chief scientific advisor atPaw Origins, tells us she has observed a significant percentage of her pup patients consistently show a sensitivity to their parents’ emotional states, which are often reflected in how they respond to care routines and cues.\n“Every day in the clinic, I see evidence of this empathetic connection. Dogs recognize happiness or sadness and respond in ways that seem emotionally supportive, such as cuddling closer when an owner is visibly upset,” Dench says.\nIf they’re following you around like your shadow, there’s a reason for that.\nHow do dogs tune into our feelings so well?\nDogs are essentially empaths, but how do we know this? This ability may depend on the extensive human-dog interactions and domestication.\nPhilip Tedeschi, human-animal connection expert with Rover and founder ofthe Institute for Human-Animal Connectionat the University of Denver, believes that the intimate evolutionary relationships between dogs and humans have led dogs to be more emotionally attuned to their parents. “The co-evolution between people and animals, a feature of domestication, has led dogs to exhibit a consistent ability to detect, distinguish and respond to their human counterparts,” Tedeschi says.\nHe adds that human-dog interactions have allowed pups to become sensitive to nuances in human behavior and emotion, and are thought to be some of the most intelligent social animals when it comes to understanding people.\n“People frequently report that their dogs are more quickly and sensitively discerning of their human's emotional experience,” he says. “It looks like facial expressions and other interpersonal information inform dogs of acute emotional shifts in those around them.”\nPlus, dogs are very observant creatures. Even when asleep, minor noises, and position shifts will get them curious. Tedeschi adds: “The careful observation by dogs specifically focuses attention to facial expression, body gestures, and relevant olfactory data, which translates to responsive social-emotional awareness.”\nCanine grumpiness is very real and the summer heat doesn't help.\nDogs respond using their own facial and body cues.\nYou know a dog can understand your facial expressions by the way they respond to you. One 2017 study showed thatdogs reacted differentlywhen shown happy and angry human facial cues. Dogs licked their mouths when they saw photos of angry human faces, but not when they heard furious voices. The mouth-licking behavioris an appeasement body signalduring dog-to-dog conversations. A dog exhibits this to let their fellow pups know they’ve come in peace.\nResearchers at Portsmouth University’s Dog Cognition Centre found that pupscreated more facial expressionswhen their parents are attentive than when they are not. Some cues include blinking, nose licking, tail wagging,and whining.\nDogs mainly use body language to communicate with humans. For instance, tail-wagging isoften associated with happiness, but it’s not always the case. Observe the tail’s position and the wag’s direction and speed to determine their emotions and intentions.\nThe faster the wag, the happier the dog. This type of wag usually happens when your pup’s tail wags with their whole body. Your dog usually does this when you get home after spending time away. On the other hand, a faster, twitch-likewagging tailmight indicate negative arousal.\nRaised hackles, or the hairs along your dog’s back, are a sign of arousal. It could mean they’re stressed but could also be excited about something. It’s an involuntary act that can happen anytime.\nTheir posture is also a strong indicator of their mood. A cowering dog is scared or stressed. A pup exposing their belly could indicate they’re either relaxed or anxious. They may even pee a bit in appeasement. You might notice them placing their chest close to the ground with their bottoms in the air, aka the play bow. The play bow is used when they want to play with their parents or other dogs.\nA dog’seyes say a lot. Soft eyes have relaxed lids, so it can seem like your pup is squinting. This eye language indicates calmness or happiness. On the other hand, when your dog’s eyes appear cold, it means they’re defending something, such as food or a toy. Eye contact is essential for dogs — a hard staremay signal aggression, andlooking awaycan mean they are stressed or anxious and trying to calm down.\nThey can communicate through their eyes. If you leave home for work every day, you may notice your dog’s eyes well up as you arrive. Believe it or not, these are tears of happiness — they’re glad they’ve finally reunited with you. A2022 study suggeststhat oxytocin triggers tear production, which increases when dogs are reunited with their parent.\nYou can certainlyfeelthe love.\nYou can improve communication with your dog.\nNow that you know dogscanread your facial expressions, you must remain mindful of your actions when interacting with your pup. Dench advises pet parents to be more conscious of their emotional state and expressions when interacting with pets, especially in stressful, training, and bonding situations.\nShe says: “Maintaining a calm, happy demeanor can help soothe a pet during visits to the vet or in new environments. Additionally, showing positive facial feedback when a dog obeys a command or behaves well can reinforce good behavior more effectively than words alone.”\nConsequently, Tedeschi thinks it’s helpful to remember that dogs — powered by their deep commitment to knowing their human parents — are capable of complex thinking. “We should reciprocate and also be observant of them, their individual and species-specific needs, opinions, capacity for consent and desires,” he adds. “For instance, I always try to acknowledge my dogs by name when they enter the room.”\nDogs are highly emotional animals — your dog can sense your facial cues and feelings because they’re always paying attention to you. Remember to always respond positively to them. For instance, if your pup is scared and runs away after seeing an object, it’s best to remove or walk away from that trigger instead of pulling them closer. You can also sit with them until they are less scared.\nRemember how your mood can affect your dog. For instance, if you feel angry at the time you plan to take your four-legged friend for a walk, you may want to take a beat to calm down before you head out. Your pup might even associate your walk with negative emotions when you get more frustrated.\nWhile negative emotions — such as anger and sadness — are inevitable, try not to channel them toward your pup. They’re your best friend — if anyone is going to make you smile again, it’s them.\nBow down, puppers. It’s time to play.\nStay positive.\nDogs can respond to your facial cues — frommouth-lickingto tail-wagging — without saying a word. Their ability to discern human facial expressions is a testament to thedeep bondbetween humans and dogs. While there’s still much to learn, the conclusion is clear — your buddy is far more emotional and perceptive than you often give them credit for. Thank them by providing them with the care and love they deserve.\nReferences:\nCurrent Advances in Assessment of Dog’s Emotions, Facial Expressions, and Their Use for Clinical Recognition of Pain\nCurrent Advances in Assessment of Dog’s Emotions, Facial Expressions, and Their Use for Clinical Recognition of Pain\nMouth-Licking by Dogs as a Response to Emotional Stimuli\nMouth-Licking by Dogs as a Response to Emotional Stimuli\nIncrease of Tear Volume in Dogs After Reunion With Owners Is Mediated By Oxytocin\nIncrease of Tear Volume in Dogs After Reunion With Owners Is Mediated By Oxytocin",

Well, our pets aren’t far off from acting like senior citizens whose predictions are more accurate than most meteorologists’. In fact, a lot of animals can sense a storm approaching because they have heightened senses. Birds, cats, dogs, and more have shown that they can sense when there’s a shift in the weather, and things are about to get intense.\nKnowing when your pet is feeling a storm coming can not only help you prepare — but also get your pet ready to make sure they’re safe and comfortable.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nThe East Coast just had a rare earthquake. Avet breaks down what to include in an emergency go-bag for your pet in times like this.\nCan pets sense when a hurricane is coming?\nWhile there isn’t a lot of research on animals being able to detect changes in weather, the research continues to grow. A2022 studyfound that dogs’ and cats’ behavior (particularly related to their anxiety) is influenced by weather events, and research continues to advance when it comes to animals and their sense of weather changes.\nThere isn’t a study that definitively proves that dogs can use their heightened sense of smell to predict a storm, but there are plenty of experts who  believe that smell plays a part. If humans are able to smell incoming rain, it’s a pretty safe bet to assume that dogs and cats, both with heightened senses of smell than our own, can smell it coming too.\nResearch continues to advance when it comes to animals and their sense of weather changes. A2013 studyfound that birds can sense a decline in barometric pressure and respond accordingly. Similarly, as the 2022 study indicated, dogs can also feel sudden drops in temperature and changes of temperature, indicating that a strong weather event, such as a hurricane or severe thunderstorm, is approaching.\n“What we need advanced tools to predict, they’re able to use their senses to feel,” dog trainer Robert Haussmann explains. “So, while that sounds a little woo-woo, it’s just really about pressure.”\nImagine that every time a storm rolled through, your sweater suddenly took on a ton of static. Well, that’s essentially what can happen with some dogs.\n“Some dogs are more sensitive depending on the coats that they have,” Robert adds. “If there’s an electrical storm, for instance, dogs who have a double coat can kind of build up some static in the electric storm.”\nIf your furry pup starts to seem a little more anxious before or during a storm, it could be because they’re feeling tiny shocks from all the insulated static electricity in their coat.\nTips for comforting your pup when the storm is too loud for your pup’s comfort.\nSigns and symptoms\nYour pet’s reaction to a hurricane or incoming storm will depend on their own temperament. If you have a dog or cat who gets spooked by loud noises, they’ll most likely act afraid or nervous. If your pet doesn’t mind storms, they might show small changes in their behavior that are a little bit harder to detect\nPets who are afraid of storms may start to show visible signs of stress and anxiety around an hour or so before the weather hits. They may start panting, pacing, orbecome extra clingy. Other changes in behavior may be more subtle, such as restlessness or acting just out of the ordinary, they may be responding to what they’re feeling from the weather. They may also show less interest in playing or physical activity.\nCats may become more reactive and fearful than usual, as well as show an increase in their vocalization.\nIf your dog starts to gravitate toward a place like the bathroom, laundry room, or another room with grounded pipes, that could signal that they’re feeling an uptick in electricity. Some dogs may also start shaking or showing signs that they want more attention from their parents.\nA VCA Animal Hospital expert explains everything you need to know about preparing for a natural disaster.\nTreatment and management\nMaking sure your pet feels extra comfortable before the storm hits may help ease their anxieties. Sit with them, act calm, put on a noise machine, or try anything else that you know will soothe them. Put extra effort in being in tune with your pet and don’t push anything. If you know your dog hates going out in the rain, for example, don’t make them do it unless there is no other option.\nIf your pet doesn’t respond to your efforts and still appears to be distressed during storms, try seeking out the help of a trainer.\n“Trainers don’t just do ‘sit,’ ‘stay,’ ‘come,’ and ‘heal.’ They can actually give you some pretty insightful tips for desensitizing and counterconditioning a dog’s emotional state to any given situation,” Haussmann tells us. “And that could be storm phobia as well.”\nWhen to see a vet\nIf you find your pet is consistently fearful and anxious to the point that it’s causing them debilitating stress or affecting their wellbeing, speak to your vet. They will be able to assess their symptoms and behavior to give you additional support tools. They will also be able to prescribe medication for anxiety or other symptoms that your pet struggles with.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nFor any major storm, people should have a preparedness plan — and that includes anysupplies your pet may need.

  "page_content": "If you scroll long enough on Tiktok (and who hasn’t?), you’ll inevitably stumble across a video of something humanity once only dreamed of: a talking dog. It’s not science fiction. For the past few years, pet parents have been teaching their dogs (and cats!) how to use speech buttons to receive cues and communicate their desires. Some,like an iconic Sheepadoodle named Bunny,have gatheredmillions of devoted followers.\nBut, welcome to the internet: There are a whole lot of naysayers. In the comments, many people question how well the speech buttons really work, and whether or not pets are really understanding language when they communicate with them.In a new studypublished inPLOS One, researchers looked for answers — and they found that dogs do in fact understand words spoken by speech buttons.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThe experiments\nDr. Federico Rossano, a professor at the University of California San Diego, and his colleagues carried out experiments with 59 dogs who had been trained to use speech buttons. The experiments took place in the dogs’ homes.\nIn the first experiment, a researcher pressed buttons and recorded the dog’s behavior; the researcher was unable to hear what the button said, and the word on the button was covered with tape. The buttons said words related to play, outside, and food: the play words were “play” or “toy,” the outside words were  “out” or “outside,” and the food words were “food,” “eat,” “dinner,” or “hungry.”\nThis study findsthat dogs can process numbers in a similar fashion to their humans.\nThe researchers wanted to observe if the dogs would “behave in anticipation of the actions or events indicated by these words,' they wrote. Some behaviors they looked out for were picking up a toy after hearing “play” or looking to a food bowl after hearing “food.”\nIn the second experiment, with a new group of dogs, pet parents themselves either pressed the button or spoke the cue out loud. There were multiple trials, and each dog experienced both a pressed and spoken word.\nThe results\nResearchers found that across experiments, the dogs showed play behaviors seven times more often after hearing a “play” button than they did on average after hearing any of the three buttons. The same was true for outside behaviors. Interestingly, they did not show more food-related behaviors after hearing the food-related cues. The findings were true whether a researcher or pet parent pressed the button or said the word aloud.\nIf only there were dogJeopardy!.\nThese results indicate that dogs are likely truly listening to speech buttons — and not just reacting to their pet parents’ body language. “Here we show that actually [dogs] do pay attention to the [soundboard] words and they produce appropriate behaviors independently of environmental cues and who produces the word,”Dr. Rossano toldThe Guardian.\nGranted, these results aren’t jaw-dropping. It’s pretty well established thatdogs can understand many words— Rossano admits this himself. “While this study is most certainly not mind-blowing, it is a necessary first step,” he toldThe Guardian. The researchers hope to aim future studies on how many (and what kind of) words dogs can understand using buttons, as well as whether or not dogs can use buttons themselves to produce appropriate responses.",

  },
  "page_content": "Do you ever look at your dog after a trip to the groomer and think they’re standing a little bit taller? Acting a little bit more regal? Or just generally strutting their stuff? Ofcourseyou do. Because they are, right? They look good, and they know it. And you know this to be true because you’ve seen them when they get a bad haircut — the way their body language changes and how they seem to hang their head in shame. Dogs (and cats — but we’ll get to them later) definitely care what they look like. It’s obvious.\nUh, not so much, according to dog expert Christina Shusterich, owner ofNY Clever K9 Inc. “Studies show dogs are not able to visually recognize themselves in a mirror,” she says.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nWithout that ability, it is impossible for them toknowwhat they look like, let alone judge it as either good or bad, beautiful or ugly. And even if they were able to make such judgements, who’s to say their assessments would align with ours?\nAs Shusterich points out, “even among humans, there isn’t a consistent, objective, or proven standard of what is considered ‘beautiful’ and what is ‘ugly.’ And dogs are not humans. They don’t think the same way we do. And while they do experience some emotions, studies support the idea that dogs’ emotionality is more limited — similar to that of a two-year-old child — and while dogs feel joy, fear, aggression, affection and even love,they do not feel guilt, shame, pride, or contempt.”\nRobert Haussmann, certified dog trainer, canine behavior consultant, and co-founder ofDogboy NYCconfirms this: “Even if dogs did experience pride or recognize beauty, they would have a completely different metric for measuring those things than we do. And dogs are much morescent-oriented anyway. If one dog is ‘attracted’ to another dog, they are more likely responding to that dog’s scent and their own biological urges than the way that dog looks.”\nHere’s why dogs know who they are more by smell than by sight.\nBut your dog knows when they’re looking spiffy, right?\nBut you’ve seen the way your dog acts when they exit the groomer with a fresh cut. They’re excited. Don’t they know how perfect they look?\n“That excitement likely isn’t because theylookgood,” says Haussmann. “But because A) they are happy the experience is over, or B) they feel better after being combed out and having their fur trimmed.”\n“Pent-up stress from being groomed is often released through hyperactive or playful behavior, which can be misunderstood by humans and anthropomorphized as ‘showing off, which is not something dogs actually do.”\nIt’s also possible that your dog is not responding so much to their new do as they are to your reaction to it. “Studies have shown dogs are able to read and understand human body language, including postures, movements, tone of voice, smells, and even facial expressions like smiles and frowns,” Shusterich says. “They’ve even shown that dogs are able to feel empathy and reciprocate feelings of love, joy, sadness, and aggression.”\nSo, if you think your dog looks good, and you are showing them you are happy, they will likely feel happy, too. If you think they look less-than-impressive and are showing them that you are upset, they will likely respond to those feelings. “Dogs do not know they have a ‘bad haircut’,” Shusterich says.\n“If your dog seems sad after leaving the groomer, it may just be about the smell,” Haussmann says. “Dogs have very sensitive noses and may not like whatever fragrance is on them. It’s also possible that after being shaved or combed, they may havesome sore spotsand want to avoid being touched. Or, if the experience was a traumatic one, it may just take a little time for the cortisol to wear off.”\nIsAnimal Planetreally their favorite channel?\nOK, so dogs don’t care what they look like, but what about cats?\n“We have no evidence to indicate that cats care about their appearance,” saysJoey Lusvardi, certified cat behavior consultant atClass Act Catsin Minneapolis. “Most of why we care about our appearance is related to social pressure, and cats don’t experience that type of pressure from other cats.”\nLusvardi adds that “cats don’t have the cognitive capacity” to comprehend or judge their own appearance the same way humans do. He continues: “We also don’t think that cats understand the concept of mirrors so it’s hard to be as obsessed with appearances as we are without having the ability to look at themselves.”\nBut what about those videos of cats who have been given lion cuts and look so abashed, even more so than dogs? “Cats do not have the cognitive capacity to experience embarrassment,” Lusvardi adds. “The cat is probably responding to the humans involved. Most likely, the humans are behaving strangely, and the cat isn’t sure what’s going on. The cat is trying to assess if they need to escape or if there is any danger around. The cat also might have just had a stressful grooming experience orgotten out of a carrier. The cat may be stressed and trying to figure out how they can get somewhere that they feel safer.”\nThis doesn’t mean that cats, like dogs, cannot enjoy the benefits of being well groomed. Matted fur can be extremely uncomfortable for cats and candamage their skin, leading to infections and other health issues, so it’s important to help them maintain their coats, even if the only one who appreciates the visual appeal of their full fluffy glory is you.\nAnd, of course, the best thing about cats and dogs not caring how they look is that they don’t care how you look, either. So, feel free to skip that shower today, if they’re the only one you’re seeing. They literally don’t care if your hair looks like a bird’s nest; they just want you to feed them.",

  "page_content": "Whether you picked this up from therapy or one of the more realistic rom-coms out there, you likely know this universal truth: Relationships take work. A lot of that work is the same across species; if you pick up a book about improving your relationship with a partner, child, or friend, it’ll likely offer similar advice as books about bonding with your dog.\nIt makes sense: We all just want to be loved, respected, and gifted the occasionalhomemade treatorheart-shaped charm. Below are nine ideas that will help you improve your relationship with your dog (no judgment if you try them on your human friends, too).\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n1. Spend time together.\nGood news: Another excuse to spend the day cuddled up with your dog. A relationship is about being with one another and sharing experiences, so spending time together will strengthen your bond — especially if you spend that time in enjoyable ways. Try going outfor a sniffariand putting in some quality playtime with your pup.\n2. Communicate clearly.\nIt’s cliché advice for a reason: Communication really is everything. Misunderstandings and confusion are the enemies of good relationships, so be as clear as you can when you communicate with your dog. Be consistent with your training signals. Because dogs tend to learn visual signals faster than vocal cues, use the former when possible. Dogs pay attention to what you do more than to what you say, which means that you should attend to what you do when you communicate with them. You’ll feel closer when there’s greater understanding between the two of you.\nWhat to do when you don’t feel the close bond you want.\n3. Put a little love into their food.\nThe way to dogs’ hearts is through their stomach, and preparing healthy, tasty food for your dog shows you care. You can choose tocook for your dogor simply focus on providing the best nutrition in the most delicious way possible.\n4. Train your dog.\nWell-trained pupsare allowed greater freedom. If they come when called, they get to spend more time off leash. If they don’t go for thefood on the table, they can stay nearby during meals. Training also reduces frustration because when you ask your dog to do something they’ve been taught to do, they know exactly what you want — no guessing games or back-and-forth required.\n5. Be playful.\nThere’s a reason I called one of my booksPlay Together, Stay Together. Scientists have observed that, across a variety of species, parents who play with their children have the closest relationships with them, and this also seems true in relationships between people and dogs. Playing games and having fun together strengthens your bond.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\n6. Remain calm.\nLosing your temper, yelling, or freaking out in any way upsets everyone in the vicinity of the emotional storm, even if it doesn’t have anything to do with them. No matter what’s going on, exude a sense of tranquility so your dog can count on you to keep your cool.\n7. Learn more about dog behavior.\nEspecially body language and facial expressions that indicate stress. When you can identify the signs that yourdog is anxiousor scared, it’s easier for you to protect or remove your dog from situations that make them uncomfortable. If your dog can count on you to keep them safe, the trust between you will be better and, in turn, so will your relationship. There are a number of excellent books and DVDs on this subject; look for works by Patricia McConnell, Suzanne Hetts, Daniel Estep and David Grant, and Barbara Handelman.\n8. Pay attention to your dog’s likes and dislikes.\nKnowing your dog’s preferences, (such as favorite games and foods), means that you can give them what they really want and be the source of all things wonderful. Similarly, keep track of what your dog can’t stand. A good starting place is to know the things that most dogs find unpleasant: head pats,citrus, or strong floral scents, loud noises, being stared at, being dressed up in clothes that impede their ability to move, andbeing hugged.\nBoundaries, folks. Boundaries.\n9. Pet your dog.\nThere is strong evidence that physical contact, such asgrooming and petting, lowers stress in shelter dogs, which is measured by reductions in both heart rate and the stress hormone cortisol, as well as by an increase in theanti-stress hormone oxytocin. This has led researchers to believe that physical contact plays a role in enhancing the bond between people and dogs.\nFocusing on your relationship is arguably the most important aspect of living with a dog. After all, you love your dog as a friend and family member, and being with them enhances your life in many ways. It’s all about the relationship, which is worth improving no matter how magnificent it is already.",

  "page_content": "I’ve seen my dog smell some strange stuff over the years. My feet, street garbage, a new rug after she rubs her butt on it; it’s all been fair game with this one. To be honest, there’s not much she won’t dig her nose into when given the opportunity. Of course, none of this will come as a huge surprise to anybody who has ever met a dog. Smelling is kind of their thing.\nRenee Rhoades, applied animal behaviorist atR+Dogs, confirms as much. “Being an olfactory-based species there are not a lot of smells that dogs don’t find interesting,” she says. In fact, Rhoades explains that dogs tend to gravitate toward complex smells — usually the stronger the better. This will often include the organic scents of the earth like grass, mud, and plants.Some studies have foundthey’re particularly partial to the scent of edible plant products such as blueberry, blackberry, peppermint, rose, and lavender.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nUnfortunately, this desire for multifaceted sniffs can also result in, let’s say, less-than-ideal scent preferences. “Dogs enjoy complex smells, for instance, urine or feces of other animals. Another animal’s waste product is going to have a lot of chemical compounds in it making it a rich olfactory experience for a dog to engage with,” Rhoades adds.\nAs I rethink every time I’ve kissed my dog’s nose and mourn the joy it once brought me, it’s important to note how crucial their smelling abilities are to the canine existence. “A dog’s whole world is really navigated through their nose,” says Leigh Siegfried, the founder and training director ofOpportunity Barks. Most estimates have a dog’s sense of smell somewhere around 10,000 to 100,000 times stronger than a human’s. With this,dogs use their noses to guide them, perceive their surroundings, and communicate with other pups.\nStill, as hard as it may be to believe, they don’t love every smell. Some scents dogs downright despise. And considering how much stronger their sense of smell is compared to humans, the discomfort these scents bring upon their nostrils can be excruciating. Think of how you feel when you smell a skunk and multiply the intensity by 10,000.\nLike any superpower, a dog’s superior smelling capability can be a double-edged sword at times. As Michelle Bernstein, animal behavior scientist atVCA Animal Hospitals, explains, “Dogs are highly sensitive to smells so a strong scent can cause them to become overwhelmed. Some of these scents are even toxic to them.”\nFireworks and thunderstorms aren’t the only things that make them say,“No, thanks!”\nScents your dog (probably) hates\nWith that in mind, it’s best to avoid the following fragrances around your pup.\nWhen thinking of the smells dogs most try to avoid,anything citrusis generally what experts have top of mind. The classic examples of citrus foods that pups hate are lemons, limes, oranges, and grapefruits. Siegfried explains it’s their acidic nature that creates an aroma that turns dogs off.\n“I think it’s a strong offensive odor. If you ever peeled an orange and invited your dog to sniff your fingers, they’ll probably not want to get in there,” she adds. This is actually a popular polling position in the animal kingdom. It’s why we’re able to use citronella candles to keep our least favorite living creatures at bay: insects.\nIf it were up to my dog, I’d never clean the house. Not only does she actively enjoy rolling in dirt and probably believes that cleaning time could be better spent with her on the couch but many household products give off nasty odors. These cleaning tools often use chlorine and ammonia, which create a harsh bleach-like smell dogs hate as much as we do. Not to mention, they’re equally dangerous for both of us.\n“We understand that these types of chemicals can be harmful to us so it is likely that the reason why dogs tend to avoid these smells is because of their toxic nature,” Rhoades says. If you’re wondering, this distaste also extends to rubbing alcohol.\nBy all accounts, dogs are not huge fans of the beauty industry. On some level, it makes sense, my dog rolls out of bed and looks absolutely perfect literally every day with no effort. She certainly doesn’t require a multi-step skincare routine to feel pretty like her dad does.\nNot to mention, beauty products can often be just as toxic to dogs as cleaning tools. “It’s likely that a dog would be put off by smells related to cleaning products or heavy artificial perfume smells,” Rhoades says. In addition to perfumes, nail polish can also cause some nasal damage.\nI don’t know if I was the only one who had to hear this as an adult, but mothballs are made of chemicals. As a result, they’re straight-up poisonous to dogs. Not that my dog needed to be told because she’s equipped with built-in chemical radar. “Not only do dogs pick up scent from the air but located on the roof of their mouth is the Jacobson’s, or vomeronasal, organ, which detects chemicals,” Rhoades explains.\nThere’s a reason most dogs enjoy eating the same food day in and day out: They don’t want to spice it up. Bernstein explains that they hate the smell of many herbs and spices. Rosemary, mint, basil, and garlic are all enemies of the canine nose. While it’s technically neither a spice nor herb, Bernstein notes dogs don’t like tosniff onions, either. For my pup, I can only imagine it’s out of fear for her tear ducts, likely due to the number of times she’s seen me ugly-cry duringThe Notebook.\nJust like anything citrus, vinegar is incredibly acidic and therefore produces a smell pooches loathe. While it’s technically safe for dogs to eat, Rhoades recommends avoiding the smells they don’t like. And you certainly shouldn’t be using them in training. “Just like we don’t enjoy having smells we dislike around often, it would be better for dogs’ health overall to not be exposed to disliked smells on a regular basis,” she says.",

You give them a light nudge to subtly beg them tostop licking, but nonetheless, the behavior continues. So why do our lovely canine companions engage in this repetitive behavior?Surelyit isn’t just to annoy us.\nDogs lick themselves for a variety of reasons. For one, it’s a natural grooming behavior, which helps to keep their fur clean and free of debris. It can also be soothing for dogs and provides comfort or stress relief. These are normal and common behaviors; however, if the licking becomes excessive or occurs out of the blue, it could be a sign that something is going on.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents.

Remember, they can’t draw their own bath or just hop in the shower whenever they want to, so if they notice some crusties on their paws, they resort to repetetive licking. They may also lick themselves because they simply don’t have anything else to do.\n“It is normal for dogs to lick themselves up to a certain point,” says Dr. Ray Spragley, founder and veterinarian atZen Dog Veterinary Care. “Dogs without an issue may lick to clean themselves or out of boredom. If they are fixated on licking a certain area and will not stop, there is likely an issue going on.”\nWhether the issue is behavioral or medical, it’s important to get to the bottom of it so your dog doesn’t do any damage to their skin or cause an infection. And as a bonus, maybe you’ll be able to get a good night’s sleep again.\nBehavioral reasons for excessive licking\nExcessive licking in dogs isn’t always a sign of a medical issue; sometimes, it stems from behavioral reasons. Here are some common behavioral causes of repetitive licking:\nBoredom: Dogs may resort to excessive licking when they’re understimulated or lacking in mental and physical activities.\nBoredom: Dogs may resort to excessive licking when they’re understimulated or lacking in mental and physical activities.\nGrooming: Dogs instinctively groom themselves, but excessive licking can indicate an overzealous grooming habit, possibly due to discomfort or stress.\nGrooming: Dogs instinctively groom themselves, but excessive licking can indicate an overzealous grooming habit, possibly due to discomfort or stress.\nAnxiety:Similar to humans, dogs may lick excessively as a coping mechanism foranxietyor stress.

Allergies are a common culprit, but there are a slew of other conditions that can lead to this peculiar behavior, whether they’re licking their paws, lips, or genitals.\n“The most common reason for a dog to lick excessively is allergies,” Dr. Spragley says. “Dogs may also lick a specific area due to pain at that spot, parasites, infections, nausea, or dry skin.”\nHere’s a quick breakdown of some common medical issues that cause excessive licking:\nAllergies: Dogs can develop allergies to various environmental triggers, such as pollen, dust mites, or certain foods. Excessive licking may be a response toitchingor irritation caused by allergies.\nAllergies: Dogs can develop allergies to various environmental triggers, such as pollen, dust mites, or certain foods.

Experts believe that dogs with ELS likely have an underlying GI issue or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). So, if you notice your dog licking both themselves and surfaces such as floors, walls, carpet, and other objects, it’s definitely worth a chat with your pup’s veterinarian.\nThe sentiment is nice, but...\nIs it normal for a dog to lick themselves a lot?\nIt’s perfectly normal for dogs to lick themselves occasionally as part of their grooming routine or to soothe minor irritations. However, if you notice your dog licking excessively, especially if it’s a change in behavior or becomes a chronic habit, it’s important to pay attention, because it could indicate an underlying problem that needs to be addressed. The reality is that “normal” can look different for each dog, but generally, sudden onset or long-term excessive licking likely signals an issue.\nHow to stop your dog from excessive licking\nIf you’re not noticing any signs of a serious medical or behavioral condition, you may want to try some home remedies for dog licking. Dr. Spragley suggests redirecting their attention by giving them something they like or playing with them. If they tend to lick out of boredom, giving them a mentally stimulating toy can also help. Here’s a round-up of home remedies for excessive dog licking you can try:\nIncrease exercise and activity: Provide regular exercise and mental stimulation to prevent boredom and anxiety.\nIncrease exercise and activity: Provide regular exercise and mental stimulation to prevent boredom and anxiety.\nConsider their diet: Make sure your dog’s diet is balanced and meets their nutritional needs to address any dietary deficiencies that may contribute to licking behavior.\nConsider their diet: Make sure your dog’s diet is balanced and meets their nutritional needs to address any dietary deficiencies that may contribute to licking behavior.\nKeep it clean: Keep your dog’s environment clean and free of potential irritants or allergens that could trigger excessive licking, such as harsh cleaning products or synthetic fabrics.\nKeep it clean: Keep your dog’s environment clean and free of potential irritants or allergens that could trigger excessive licking, such as harsh cleaning products or synthetic fabrics.\nDiscourage the behavior: Use bitter-tasting deterrent sprays on areas your dog tends to lick excessively to discourage the behavior.\nDiscourage the behavior: Use bitter-tasting deterrent sprays on areas your dog tends to lick excessively to discourage the behavior.\nPractice positive reinforcement: Positive reinforcement training techniques can help redirect your dog’s licking behavior towards more appropriate activities.\nPractice positive reinforcement: Positive reinforcement training techniques can help redirect your dog’s licking behavior towards more appropriate activities.\nElizabethan collar (cone): In cases of excessive licking, it may be necessary to put on an Elizabethan collar while you wait for a veterinarian to assess the situation.\nElizabethan collar (cone): In cases of excessive licking, it may be necessary to put on an Elizabethan collar while you wait for a veterinarian to assess the situation.\nCompression vests, interactive toys, and pheromone sprays will be game-changers this Fourth of July.\nWhen should I take my dog to the vet for excessive licking?\nAt a certain point, the licking will likely become unbearable for both you and your dog. The sound is driving you nuts and your dog’s skin is getting red and irritated, and not stopping the behavior could lead to even worse issues such as infections orlick granulomas.\n“You should take your dog to the vet if they are becoming fixated on licking a certain area,” Dr. Spragley explains. “By licking an area, they are introducing bacteria to that spot as well as traumatizing the skin in that area. Without treatment, they will almost always cause themselves an infection if it continues.”\nDr. Spragley says that if you notice an odor or redness, to bring them to the vet immediately. If they are licking the air, objects, or the environment excessively, you should also bring them to the vet to determine the cause.\nThankfully, there are treatments. But first, you have to figure out why they have an itch to scratch.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nDogs lick their privates as a part of their grooming routine. However, they may also engage in this behavior to alleviate itching or discomfort caused by irritation, allergies, or even infections. If you notice excessive licking in this area accompanied by signs of pain or inflammation, it’s essential to consult with a veterinarian to rule out any underlying medical issues.\nDogs lick their lips for various reasons, such as to alleviate anxiety or stress, as a signal of submission, or in anticipation of food. It can also be a reflexive response to something delicious or a way to gather more information about their environment through scent. Lip-licking can also be a response to physical discomfort, such as nausea or digestive upset.\nYes, lick mats can be beneficial for dogs who engage in excessive licking behavior. These mats provide a distraction and can help soothe anxiety or stress. By spreading a tasty treat or food paste on the mat, you can engage your dog’s senses and encourage them to focus on a positive activity rather than excessive licking. However, it’s essential to supervise your dog while using a lick mat to ensure they don't ingest too much food or the mat itself.\nReferences:\nGastrointestinal Disorders in Dogs With Excessive Licking of Surfaces\nGastrointestinal Disorders in Dogs With Excessive Licking of Surfaces",

Murphy whimpered, barked, and chewed the carpet whenever she was left alone. Tucker growled and lunged at every man he encountered. Maggie was inconsolable during thunderstorms —  pacing, whining, circling, jumping in and out of the bathtub.\nAll of these dogs have one thing in common: Their behavioral problems are a result of fear. But because fear-based behavior can vary so widely — from cowering under the table when a truck roars by to lunging at and evenbiting visitors— pet parents don’t always recognize that their dogs exhibiting it are fearful.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents.

Dr. Dan Estep, PhD and certified applied animal behaviorist (CAAB), notes that, unfortunately, early and perhaps subtle signs of fear —ears pulled back, tail tucked, avoidance — are often written off as things that all dogs do. If these signs are ignored, the signals may become more obvious and include panting and dilated pupils.\nEven then, it may be possible to distract the dog from the fear source. But, over time, fearful dogs act more intensely, become harder to distract, and then becomedestructive or reactive. Only then, when the problem is much more serious and harder to resolve, do people seek help. That’s why it’s so important to recognize the signs of fearfulness in dogs and intervenebeforethe behavior becomes more difficult to deal with.\nAccording to Dr. Estep, “fears have behavioral, physiological, and subjective components.” Some dogs flee in an attempt to avoid the stimuli that elicit fear; these dogs may hide under the bed or behind their guardian, or simply turn away from whatever it is that frightens them. The appearance of some dogs’ eyes change when they are afraid: The pupils may dilate, or more of the sclera (whites of the eyes) may be visible in an expression known as “whale eye.” This may be the result of a dog watching what frightens them by moving their eyes so they can see it without looking at it directly. Or, a dog may scan an area repeatedly in a highly vigilant manner.\nFearful dogs may also adopt telltale body postures: crouching in a lowered body position or lying down and freezing. Many dogs whine,barkor make other distress vocalizations. A fearful dog who is forced to confront or contend with what’s scaring them may become defensively aggressive while still exhibiting signs of fear.\nHow to cope with dog anxiety—from training to medication.\nDogs who are fearful often exhibit many physiological changes, as well: the sympathetic nervous system becomes aroused, which means an increase in heart rate and respiration and possibly shaking, trembling, or panting. As Dr. Estep observes, “No one of these signs by themselves is a reliable indicator of fear or any other emotional state. It’s the pattern of these things together that indicates fear.”\nBoth Dr. Estep and Wilde note that most common canine fears are related to loud or sudden noises,separation anxiety, and unfamiliar people. A fearful dog can be afraid of just about anything new, whether it’s a man in a hat, an umbrella, or a stroller.\nJust as the behavior exhibited by fearful dogs can vary, so can the reasons for the fearfulness. This may be because fear is such a common emotion. As Dr. Patricia B. McConnell, PhD, writes inFor the Love of a Dog: Understanding Emotion in You and Your Best Friend, “Surely fear must be the universal of emotions, given its importance to survival. Without it, even civilized urban dwellers wouldn’t live to pass on their genes, because they’d stroll in front of buses and forget to lock their doors at night.”\nMcConnell’s example is apt: Fear serves an important function. Without fear, it would be difficult to recognize dangers to which the appropriate reaction is critical for survival. So, fear is not itself a bad thing. It becomes a problem when individuals of any species, including dogs, are scared or skittish around so many things, or the fear is so intense, that it interferes with their enjoyment of daily life.\nDo these things to help your pup (and your guests) feel chill.\nWhy is my dog so fearful?\nWe wish we had a straight answer to this question. The reasons that dogs are fearful are exceedingly complex and very difficult to determine for an individual dog, much less for dogs in general.\nAny pup — purebred or mixed breed, male or female, young or old, rescue or from a breeder — can develop fear-based behaviors. That said, there is compelling evidence that any one of several factors can result in fearful dogs, including genetics.\nExperiments done with Pointers in the 1960s demonstrated that you can breed for fear of people in dogs.* Additionally, many dogs who are fearful have littermates or other relatives with this problem, which suggests a genetic predisposition.\nIt’s hard to tease apart the effects of early experiences and genetics. For example, an entire litter of puppies could also be fearful of people because they were raised with no opportunity to meet them;proper socializationcould have resulted in puppies without such fears.\nSocialization is indeed important: It’s critical to expose puppies to new people, places, animals, sounds, objects and anything else they are likely to encounter throughout their lives. As Dr. Estep succinctly puts it, “Positive early experiencesare critical for preventing fearfulness.” From ages three to 12 weeks, puppies are especially receptive to learning that the unfamiliar is not to be feared.\nNot all fears develop in puppyhood, however. At age eight, a Miniature Schnauzer named Maxine suddenly developed a fear of other dogs,reacting with barks, lunges, and growlswhenever a dog approached. She even reacted to her companion dog — a four-year-old Miniature Schnauzer who had been her playmate since being adopted as a puppy. I met Maxine when I was working at a dog camp and wondered if she was in pain, because sudden reactivity at an older age is consistent with thepresence of pain.\nWhen the camp veterinarian examined Maxine, she discovered inflammation along her spine and noted that she yelped when that spot was touched. A canine chiropractor treated Maxine, and once her health improved, so did her behavior. A dog who knows that it is going to hurt when dogs leap on them or roughhouse with them could react with behavior that’s intended to make the other dogs go away.\nNot surprisingly, negative experiences may also lead to fear. For example, a dog who is hit by a car may become afraid of cars. Similarly, a dog who accidentally knocks over a bunch of two-by-fours in the garage may develop a fear of any long object such as wood, brooms or shovels, or become afraid of the garage.\nCan dogs overcome their fears?\nThe good news for pet parents is that yes, dogs can overcome their fears. The bad news is that it takes a lot of work, patience, and understanding. It also requires a high level of proactivity, since these problems rarely resolve on their own. As Debbie Jacobs, animal behaviorist and author ofA Guide to Living With & Training a Fearful Dog, puts it, “Fear is an emotion and changing how a dog, or a person, feels about something is a challenge.” In most cases, professional help from a trainer or behaviorist who uses positive methods is a fundamental part of recovery.\nThere are so many misconceptions about treating fearfulness in dogs that before discussing what to do, it’s important to know what not to do. Ascribing to any of the following myths is detrimental to progress when working with a fearful dog.\nHere’s how your dog’s ears can clue you in to how they’re feeling.\nMisconceptions about fearful dogs\nExpecting a dog to “just get over it” is wishful thinking.\nThe behavior that most commonly elicits concerns of abuse in a dog’s past is that the dog is only scared of men. While it’s possible that a man has harmed the dog, fearful dogs are often more reactive to men than to women or to children, and this is particularly true of dogs whose socialization experiences were inadequate. It’s likely that men — with their larger size, deeper voices, and broader shoulders — appear more imposing to dogs.\nIt’s natural to assume that a dog who is scared of children has been teased by them, or that the only reason a dog would react badly to a broom is because of a terrifying experience with one. Yes, bad experiences sometimes lead to fear, but often, dogs are afraid of things that are new or unpredictable. So, the dog may fear children because they scream and move around in crazy ways, or they may fear brooms because he’s not used to them.\nPunishment will make the dog more fearful, and must not be used as a way to change any fear-based behavior. When bad things happen to a dog in the presence of what scares them, it makes the fear and the problem behavior worse, not better.\nIn some cases, and always under the supervision of a veterinarian,pharmacological interventionmay be appropriate, in conjunction with behavior modification and other techniques for helping fearful dogs. However, there is no magic pill that instantly cures fearfulness in dogs.\nWhen a dog refuses to get in a car or crate, resists allowing the vet to examine them, or won’t go down the steps to the basement, many people perceive their behavior as obstinate. But with fearful dogs, stubbornness is not the problem, any more than a kid standing on the high dive and refusing to jump is being mulish.\nStatus is a fact of life for many social species, but when dogs are afraid, their social standing is not the issue. Trying to fit all behavior problems under the heading of dominance does far more harm than good. Happily, more and more people recognize this perspective as outdated and counterproductive.\nCertified canine behavior consultant Pia Silvani’s comment on this common misconception is simple and to the point: “With all due respect, this does not make a bit of sense.” It is okay to reassure your dog that everything is fine in a calm and confident manner. To ignore them when they are clearly distressed is about as logical as refusing to hug your child when they wake up from a nightmare.\nThey are not going to become more fearful when they are reassured, but failing to do anything risks teaching them that you are not available when they need you most. Wilde tells her clients, “Be affectionate with your dog, but if you are overly worried, your dog will be, too. It’s fine to reassure your dog casually with an upbeat tone, but don’t coddle them with nervous energy.”\nThankfully, this is not true, but resolving a dog’s fear-based problem does take effort. As Jacobs puts it, “It’s not easy and it never happens as quickly as you’d like it to. It’s going to require more work, time and energy than you anticipated.” Many dogs recover completely, and still others improve greatly, though they may always remain on the cautious side; some situations may always be overwhelming and should be avoided.\nIf your dog loses their sh*t over anything—from a squirrel to a guest. Here are some tips to curtail that.\nSo, how can I help my fearful dog?\nPart of working with a fearful dog involves accepting that it’s hard to know how far a particular dog can go in overcoming the problem. If a pet parent expects that any dog can become happy-go-lucky, extroverted and confident, they may be disappointed in the future.\nAs Jacobs writes, “Changing our own views, beliefs, and expectations may be the first step the parent of a fearful dog needs to take.” To help a dog overcome fear, it is often most effective to combine several basic strategies.\nThe first step should be a thorough medical evaluation to determine if health problems are playing a role. Dogs who are in pain may develop fear of anything that exacerbates the pain, such as being touched, being approached by a playful dog, a leash or collar, or asport class like agility.\nOlder dogs may develop fears and phobias following physical changes, including cognitive deterioration orloss of sightor hearing. A myriad of other physical problems can be in play as well, and any underlying medical issue should be resolved.\nThis may involve being an advocate for your dog, such as stopping strangers from petting them or refusing to let a family member use power tools until you get the dog out of the house. Management of the environment is a lot of work, but it’s work that pays big dividends. Protecting a dog from exposure to situations that scare them is a great way to start, because every time a fearful dog becomes afraid, the problem is compounded.\nAnd as Jaak Panksepp, neuroscientist, psychobiologist, and author ofAffective Neuroscience: The Foundations of Human and Animal Emotions, once said, “One of the most horrible experiences of life is to be stricken by sudden terror. Another is to be continually consumed by the persistent feelings of anxiety that gnaw away at you, destroying your sense of security in the world.”\nFor dogs who are reactive to the point of snapping or biting, preventing situations in which the dog feels the need to do this is essential for the safety of others as well as for the well being of the dog.\nIt’s not going to help, and it may make the situation worse, adding yet another scary experience that confirms your pup’s belief that something is worth being afraid of. Wilde advises that we allow the dog to make the decision about approaching or avoiding a potentially scary situation.\nDeveloping your dog’s confidence can help them overcome their fearfulness because these two states of being are not compatible. Anything that allows a dog to experience success is good for their self esteem and adds to their self-assurance. Training dogs to perform behaviors on cue — standard obedience exercises, targeting, responding to their names or performing tricks — can build confidence.\nSo can getting their nourishment fromfood-reward puzzlesorfood-stuffed toys, because accessing the food is an accomplishment. Play is also a way to help dogs feel confident. Once a fearful dog is comfortable enough to happily engage in play, a positive feedback loop develops. The more they play, the more confident they are, and the more confident they are, the more they play.\nThese techniques are often the core treatment for fearful dogs. Systematic desensitization is a structured way of repeatedly exposing your dog to something that they fear, but starting at a low level so that fear is not induced. Then, gradually, during many sessions over a period of weeks, months or even years, the intensity of what frightens them is increased so that they can get used to it at each level before moving on to the next.\nScary things are made less scary by being smaller, slower, quieter, farther away or otherwise less intense. Exposing your dog to what frightens them at an intensity level that is too low to induce their fear is completely different than forcing they to confront what he fears by overdoing it and actually scaring them. (For details on these techniques, McConnell’s booklet,The Cautious Canine, is a great resource.)\nClassical counterconditioning consists of pairing up what frightens the dog with something the dog loves more than anything else; eventually, the dog realizes that the scary thing predicts the wonderful thing. If your dog fears people, then every time he sees someone, they should immediately receive atheir favorite treator highly prized toy or other item. Eventually, the dog will have a positive emotional reaction to seeing a person, because they know that something good is about to happen.\nExposing your dog to the trigger that scares them, starting at very low levels of intensity and gradually working up to more intense exposures, is most effective. In practice, desensitization and classical counterconditioning are often done together.\nSome dogs progress rapidly, but others make progress that can only be detected when viewed long-term, over years or perhaps over the dog’s entire life. No matter which pattern describes your dog, it’s important to work gradually, and as Wilde says, “go at the dog’s pace.” You must only move to more intense triggers when the dog is clearly comfortable at the previous level of exposure. Fearful dogs must be handled carefully and with endless patience.\nMost behaviorists and trainers agree that in addition to specific behavior modification, a good foundation for helping dogs overcome their fears is built from many aspects of their daily life. Good nutrition, regular exercise and predictable routines are all helpful. Other potentially calming, therapeutic techniques or alternativetherapies include massage, anxiety wraps, Bach flower essences, homeopathic remedies, acupuncture, and Traditional Chinese Medicine.\nWhether or not you believe in crystal healing, Chani Ronez’s chic, customizable, and sustainable products are designed to help treat everything from separation anxiety to joint pain to GI issues.\nHow much will my dog improve?\nAlmost all fearful dogs can improve, but the degree to which a dog overcomes their fear depends on many factors. Dr. Estep and Wilde agree that the human partner is a huge factor in the eventual outcome. Motivation is critical for success, as is an understanding of the situation and the amount of time the person is willing to commit to it. The use of gentle, positive methods is also linked with improvement. Mild fears or those of recent development have a higher likelihood of successful resolution. The dog’s genetics play a role as well; the stronger the genetic component of the dog’s fears, the harder it may be to overcome them.\nWilde sums up the basic approach to helping fearful dogs: “It takes time and patience. Always be gentle, positive and kind. Never, ever use physical force or corrections.” Jacobs echoes this advice: “Your dog’s trust in you is the most important building block in the foundation for building their confidence. Never use any type of punishment or correction which scares or intimidates your dog.”\nThough it can be gut-wrenching to watch a dog live in fear, there are also positive aspects, and that may be part of the reason why some people are drawn to fearful dogs. Wilde has a long-standing history of relating to them: “I always had an empathy for the fearful ones. I was drawn to the shaking dog in the corner.” She points out that having a fearful dog “teaches you a lot about subtleties of canine body language. You become tuned into your dog. You learn to manage things. You gain increased empathy for your dog. You expand your knowledge and patience.”\nHelping a dog who lives in fear is a common undertaking — many pet parents, knowingly or not, end up living with a dog who is afraid. To succeed in treating a fearful dog so that they can conquer their fears requires knowledge, consistent effort and extraordinary patience. It’s not easy, but it’s gratifying to see the difference in a dog who has been the beneficiary of this hard work.\nWhile it is an experience that is likely to have lows that are lower and highs that are higher than expected, many pet parents report that it is immensely rewarding to work with their dogs and help them overcome their fears. As though we needed further convincing that dogs of all types, including the fearful ones, enrich our lives!\nFinal takeaway — 10 things to remember if you have a fearful dog\nBe patient — it can take a long time for dogs to overcome their fears.\nBe patient — it can take a long time for dogs to overcome their fears.\nCommit to helping your dog by putting in the time and effort to treat their fears.\nCommit to helping your dog by putting in the time and effort to treat their fears.\nDon’t force your dog into situations that you know induce fear.\nDon’t force your dog into situations that you know induce fear.\nBe open to the variety of techniques that may help your dog conquer their fears.\nBe open to the variety of techniques that may help your dog conquer their fears.\nHandle any relevant medical issues.\nHandle any relevant medical issues.\nBe gentle, positive and kind.\nBe gentle, positive and kind.\nNever use punishment.\nNever use punishment.\nProtect your dog from scary situations.\nProtect your dog from scary situations.\nAccept that many fearful dogs never become gregarious, go-with-the-flow types.\nAccept that many fearful dogs never become gregarious, go-with-the-flow types.\nLove your dog for who they are.\nLove your dog for who they are.\nReferences:\nHelp for Your Fearful Dog\nHelp for Your Fearful Dog\nFor the Love of a Dog: Understanding Emotion in You and Your Best Friend\nFor the Love of a Dog: Understanding Emotion in You and Your Best Friend\nThe Cautious Canine\nThe Cautious Canine\nA Guide to Living With & Training a Fearful Dog\nA Guide to Living With & Training a Fearful Dog",

  },
  "page_content": "As someone who has been alive for (expletive deleted) years, I’m old enough to remember when Grumpy Cat ruled the Internet. But what dog parents knew then and what remains true today is why there was never a grumpy dog celebrity pet. It’s because they wouldn’t have been too remarkable. The truth is that this emotion and general display of displeasure is nothing new to the larger canine population. In fact, it’s quite common.\nFor example, my dog Banshee is nothing if not a grumpy old lady. Whenever I’m working, leaving, or doing anything without her, she’s all frowns and pouts. Lately, she’s also been acting extra cranky thanks largely to the heatwave currently hitting the East Coast. And despite blasting the air conditioner all day, she still blames me for her discomfort. I say this with apologies to our planet’s future, it’s hard being environmentally friendly with a sulking senior Pittie. But when does her face reflect more than a sassy attitude and suggest a real concern? I brought in an expert to find out.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nIs my dog grumpy?\nIn what is quickly turning into a near-daily tradition for me, I should first address whether I’m projecting human emotion onto my dog. Sure, when I suggest that Bansheefeels guiltyabout keeping me up all night licking her paws, I’ll reluctantly admit that I might be exaggerating a bit. But grumpiness doesn’t fall under thiscategory of anthropomorphism, at least not always. As applied animal behaviorist and founder ofR+DogsRenee Rhoades explains, it’s certainly a response pups are capable of.\n“Anthropomorphism looks at attributing human characteristics or behaviors to animals or objects that cannot express these emotions, however, irritability is most definitely one of the emotions that dogs can express,” she says.\nPro tips to keep your pup safe, happy, and exercised during the warmer months.\nThat being said, Rhoades does warn it’s possible to incorrectly project certain forms of grumpiness onto our pets. This is especially true when it’s seemingly inspired by spite, guilt, or rudeness — three emotions thatdogs are not capable of feeling. In these scenarios, this type of emotional projection will only make the situation worse. Not to mention, it could potentially do more harm to your pet as whatever is genuinely causing their grumpiness will likely go ignored.\nWhat makes dogs grumpy?\nIt turns out dogs act grumpy for many of the same reasons humans do. Of course, dogs will never match those rare cranky souls constantly lashing out from a lifetime of bad decisions. But overall, there is a lot of crossover and Rhoades warns that this is a common oversight for pet parents. “I think that we can discount many of our dogs’ experiences possibly because we don’t understand that their emotions are largely parallel to our own,” she says.\nJust like us, our pups might become prickly from a lack of sleep, being hungry, or simply boredom. And as Rhoades explains, dogs can even grow annoyed and sullen from day-to-day stress — how relatable! However, instead of being caused by having to complete the endless cycle of mundane occupational tasks necessary to reach the appropriate level of economic standing to obtain an ever-moving decent standard of living, this type of dog stress is usually just the product of a change in routine.\nThe most common cause, though, is physical discomfort. According to Rhoades, this can manifest in body language shifts that, when ignored, might even develop into behavioral issues like reactivity. That’s why any sudden changes should always be investigated. “One of the clearest ways for us to identify pain in our dogs is through behavior changes like irritability,” she says.\nIt turns out that my sulky pup isn’t the only one who reacts in such a manner to high temps. Thanks to the discomfort of wearing a permanent fur coat, the heat of summer can absolutely encourage additional crankiness for many dogs. Again, it’s not unlike how many humans react to the heat, except dogs don’t have to experience the heartbreak of a great hair day ruined by humidity. “Just like us, dogs will experience a rise in body temperature resulting in them sweating from exposure to hotter temperatures. The body’s natural response to a rise in temperature can feel uncomfortable, resulting in grumpiness,” Rhoades explains.\nItdoeshave something to do with dogs, believe it or not.\nBiological factors like breed and age may also inspire grumpiness. Not unlike myself, dogs also appear to dislike facing the inevitability of time. “Older dogs are possibly more likely to experience grumpiness and again this is most likely largely going to be due to their physical discomfort,” Rhoades explains. Can’t say I’m too surprised given the grumpy senior pup I share my life with, though it’s nice to know she understands my pain when I constantly complain about my — still very young — back.\nRegarding breed, Rhoades cautions against putting too much stock into it given the massive amounts of variability within each one. Still, there are a few standouts with genetic staples that might predispose them to a life of grumpiness. Mainly, she points tobrachycephalic breedslike Bulldogs, Pugs, and Shih Tzus, due to their common breathing difficulties. And considering my own temperament during allergy season, I can understand why they’re irritated about being constantly stuffed up.\nHow to turn that frown, etc., etc.\nOf course, anyone who has come face to face with a grumpy dog knows the effect it can have on the heartstrings. That poutiness might make you feel helpless but there is plenty you can do to relieve their discomfort. Rhoades recommends inspecting a dog’s overall physical and mental well-being, what she refers to as their foundational wellness.\n“Asking questions like, ‘How much daily stress are they encountering?’, ‘Do you have outlets for natural behaviors?’ and ‘Are they experiencing pain?’ Then becoming proactive by investigating the outcomes of those questions can start to open up the dialogue of why your dog is behaving a certain way,” Rhoades says.\nFrom DIY ice-fruit bowls to dog-friendly ice cream, they will be chillin’.\nTo determine whether there is a physical or mental issue brewing, slight changes in body language can often be the largest indicator. Rhoades states that one of the best things dog parents can do for their pets is pay attention to their standard body language and react appropriately to any sudden shifts. “If you have a true understanding of body language, you have a better view into understanding how your dog is feeling,” she adds.\nBody language that might indicate your pup is stressed or in physical pain includes an arched back, panting, holding their head below their shoulders, or trembling. In terms of other behavior, they might lick excessively, become restless, have changes in their sleeping habits, whimper, howl, or avoid touch. Mobility issues like limping, a newfound reluctance to walking, or moving slower than usual, may also indicate discomfort.\nIdentifying these changes will then help you, along with your vet, zero in on the root cause of their grumpiness. Afterward, it’ll be easier to alleviate their pain or stress and alter their grouchy disposition. More than anything, however, Rhoades makes it clear we should never punish our pets for acting grumpy and instead focus on what’s causing the moody response.\n“Our dogs rely on us to care for them and keep them safe and we can do that best when we’re kind and empathetic to their needs,” she says.",

  "page_content": "In their development, puppies go through at least two phases where they are particularly fearful, even if they haven’t previously shown signs of being scared. These are called “fear periods.” These fear periods in dogs can take pet parents off guard if they don’t know about them. If they are expecting to see fear stages in dogs, it’s easier for both the peopleandthe dogs to handle them and move past them in a way that is most beneficial to their dogs.\nKnowing that puppy fear periods are a normal part of development makes it easier to cope when your dog is suddenly scared of things that didn’t used to bother them.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat are puppy fear periods?\nPuppy fear periods are normal developmental stages. At this time, young dogs are more fearful than they are before orafterthese stages. Fear periods are predictable stages in puppy development during which dogs are more likely to react to people or objects in a way that tells us they are scared.\nThe triggers may be new things, as puppies are often more afraid of new things during fear periods than they are either before or after these fear periods. Puppies may also react to objects or people that never used to stress them out, like a trash can on the side of the road, a door slamming, or a person shoveling snow.\nNot all fearful dogs have been mistreated.\nPuppies have fear periods because it is advantageous for them to be cautious at certain times during their development. There are many causes of fearfulness in dogs, and lots of reasons dogs are cautious or afraid of all kinds of things. Many of the causes of fearfulness in dogs affect dogs’ development and their adult behavior.\nIf dogs have had insufficient socialization, a traumatic experience or multiple traumatic experiences, or they are genetically predisposed to fearfulness, they will need help to overcome their fears. Even if they improve a lot, they are unlikely to be as happy-go-lucky or confident as dogs whose lives were never touched by such challenges.\nFear periods are different because most dogs go through them and emerge from them without lingering fears being carried into adulthood. Puppies are more fearful and cautious at certain predictable times in their development. These milestones are associated with change in the puppy’s life when being cautious helps keep them safe.\nWhat to expect when your perfect puppy hits that unruly stage.\nThe first puppy fear period happens around the time that puppies leave their litter and their mother and begin their life in a new home. With exposure to an entirely new environment with potential unknown dangers and without their mom there to guide and protect them, a little extra caution benefits them. Similarly, the second puppy fear period happens during a time when adolescents are becoming more independent — faster and stronger, too. A little extra concern about the world, manifested as fearfulness, likely prevents them from dangers.\nThe first fear period in puppies happens when puppies are about eight to 11 weeks old (roughly two to three months in age). The second fear period occurs when dogs are in the range of six to 14 months old. This second fear period in puppies is associated with adolescence and has been called “juvenile onset shyness” by famous behaviorist and dog trainer Patricia B. McConnell, PhD. This fear stage in adolescent dogs is often more surprising to people because they have usually been living with their dog for longer and aren’t accustomed to them being fearful.\nSeeing their dog change in a manner that has them acting differently, especially when they behave less confidently than before leaves many people asking with shock, “Why is my dog anxious all of a sudden?” But both the first fear period in dogs and the second fear period in dogs are well-known fear periods that occur at predictable ages.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nPuppy fear periods usually last just a few weeks, though lasting over a month is not unusual. It’s typical for puppies in fear periods to react to things they didn’t used to care about, like trash cans on the side of the road, a skateboarder going by, or the sound of the blender when you make your morning smoothie, but still be chill about many of the ordinary events and objects they encounter in their daily life.\nIf the puppy is scared of everything or the fears last for many months, what’s going on may not be a fear period. The situation may be a dog who is more generally anxious or fearful. These dogs may need more help overcoming their fears than typical dogs who are experiencing the typical fear stage in adolescent dogs or in puppies.\nYour puppy training schedule, from eight weeks to six months. Let’s do this.\nWhat does a fearful dog look like?\nFear-based behavior can vary widely — from cowering under the table when a truck roars by to lunging at, and even biting,visitors. Many dogs whine, bark, or make other distress sounds. People don’t always recognize these actions as fearful behavior. Other signs of fearfulness in dogs are telltale body postures and visual signals including:\nCrouching in a lowered body position\nCrouching in a lowered body position\nLying down and freezing\nLying down and freezing\nTension in body or face\nTension in body or face\nMouth closed shut tightly\nMouth closed shut tightly\nPanting\nPanting\nYawning\nYawning\nTongue flicking\nTongue flicking\nPulling back the corners of their mouth\nPulling back the corners of their mouth\nDilated pupils\nDilated pupils\nActively avoiding looking at something\nActively avoiding looking at something\nShowing a half moon shape of the white of their eye (called “whale eye”)\nShowing a half moon shape of the white of their eye (called “whale eye”)\nPutting their ears back\nPutting their ears back\nTucking their tail\nTucking their tail\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nHow to help you puppy when they become fearful\nWhen your dog is spooked by something, follow these general guidelines. Getting out of the scary situation is an important part of helping them overcome their fears, but there are other tips to overcome fearfulness when puppies are going through a fear period.\nTalk in a relaxed, cheerful way to your dog, perhaps saying, “Yes, that’s a really loud truck, isn’t it? Oh, look, there it goes down the road.” Obviously, your dog won’t know what you are saying, but your normal conversational tone of voice can help your dog calm down.\nTalk in a relaxed, cheerful way to your dog, perhaps saying, “Yes, that’s a really loud truck, isn’t it?

You want them to come to you when they need to feel more secure. There is no need to worry that you are reinforcing your dog’s fears.

Try to control your own startled response to yourdog’s barkingorlunging, if possible.\nDon’t force your dog to approach something they fear. Doing so will just make them more scared, which is counterproductive. If your dog wants to get away from a ladder or a man shoveling snow, that’s fine. Sometimes, the best thing you can do is minimize their exposure to something overwhelming, even if that means turning and heading the other way. Just calmly turn and move away from what is scaring your dog so that they don’t get any more worked up. If your dog can count on you to get them out of situations that scare them, that is good for their confidence and builds their trust in you.\nDon’t force your dog to approach something they fear.

So, if your dog suddenly widens their eyes and looks nervous when they see a new person, try to have as many new people as you can toss them a treat when they are far enough away that your dog is OK with them. If traffic cones set your dog off, give them a treat or pull out a tug toy every time you see one. It’s important that it’s something the dogloves. The more you can teach them that things that spook them predict good things, the easier it will be for them to overcome their adolescent fears.\nGive your dog something they love whenever they get nervous.

It’s so useful to know this stage is temporary and completely normal.\nWithin a few weeks or a month, your dog is likely to be just as social and happy about whatever the world brings their way as they were when they were a puppy. If your puppy always found the world to be a scary place, they will most likely continue to becautious or fearfulas an adult, but they may be even more so in adolescence.\nReferences:\nUnderstanding Fear Periods in Dogs\nUnderstanding Fear Periods in Dogs\nNervous Behaviour\nNervous Behaviour",

  "page_content": "No matter how Type-A you consider yourself, bringing home a new dog is overwhelming. And by the time they actually arrive at your house, you may be so burned out on research, prep, and all the logistics you had to sort in advance that you’re at a loss for what to do with them. (Cue theWho the hell are you?staring contest.) Don’t freak out: Just remember the Rule of Threes, and you’ll get through the getting-to-know-you phase just fine.\nWhen it comes to dog development, you can expect your dog to go through pretty distinct “decompression phases” in the first three days, weeks, and months after they become your roommate. During these periods, it’s important to establish a routine and to set expectations for yourself and your pup. After all, this is a long-term commitment for the two of you. But don’t feel pressure to rush it — getting through the ups and downs of learning all about each other won’t happen in a day, a week, a month…maybe even a year, if I’m being honest. The Rule of Threes will just give you a running start.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nThe first three days\nThink about the last time you were in an unfamiliar situation — maybe you felt shy and acted like a wallflower, or maybe you were totally energized and extended your hand to anybody who would shake it. People have different reactions to newness, and so do dogs.\nThe first three days will likely be overwhelming, and every dog will react differently to suddenly being in a new place, with new smells and new people. Puppies may have always been with their siblings, and are now suddenly expected to sleep alone at night. Adolescent dogs may be unable to sit still, seemingly bouncing off the walls, eager to explore everything. And dogs of any age may all of a sudden have accidents, even if they are already house-trained. Some dogs may shut down, and some may act out. All of this is normal. Just remember that these first few days are not an indication of how your dog will be forever — for better or worse!\nThe best way toprep for this periodis to set aside three days for scheduled, quiet integration. It’s tempting to have all your favorite people over to meet your new pup, but that can be too much for a dog who is in the midst of learning who is a safe person and what is a safe place. Set up a routine and keep it the same every day; for example, feed them in the same spot and go the same route on every walk — all at scheduled times. Soon, you’ll find your pup is relaxing and starting to show more of their personality.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nThe first three weeks\nIt takes three weeks for a dog to get through what I like to call “The Honeymoon Period.” During that time, dogs arelearning the rulesof the new place. They probably aren’t barking at the doorbell because they don’t feel protective of their home yet, nor are they hoarding their toys because they may never have had creature comforts before and don’t even know what they’re meant for! They may not pull on the leash, either, because they’re still trying to figure out where they are.\nOn the flip side, behaviors like crying in the crate at night or guarding their food may be happening. Your dog is still unsure of what the next day will look like, and this can manifest in anxiety and general restlessness.\nThe best thing you can do is stay consistent. Work on simple training like recognizing their name, sitting, and going to their “place” or bed. If your dog starts guarding their possessions, hire aprofessional trainerASAP so you can nip this behavior in the bud before it gets worse. And if you have other pets, carefully supervise all interactions betweenresident dogs, because the novelty of a new playmate may wear off when they begin to realize they have to share their stuff. Make sure each dog has a designated safe space where they can go if they feel overwhelmed (or where they can safely be kept out of the way if need be). Stay consistent withwalking schedulesand gear to set good habits.\nThe first three months\nAfter three months, your dog will finally be showing their true personality. They will have formed emotional attachments with you (and your other pets), they’ll understand that this is home, and they will have hopefully settled into a routine. If you’re still seeing negative behaviors, this is a good time to kick training into high gear. You may want to addmore walks,obedience training, andmental stimulationto keep your pup happy. If everything isn’t perfect at this stage, that’s OK! Now’s the time to work with your pal to get it sorted for good.",

    "title": "9 Myths About Your Puppy—Busted By a Behaviorist",

  },
  "page_content": "Dispelling myths about raising and training puppies helps change patterns of behavior that are detrimental to the goal of raising happy, healthy, well-behaved, and well-adjusted puppies. That in turn can make it easier for puppies to adapt to their new home in a way that sets up people and dogs alike for a full dog’s lifetime of love and happy relationships. Let’s debunk nine common myths so you and your puppy can start your life together on the right paw (sorry, had to).\nMyth 1: Puppies can’t be around other dogs at all until they are fully vaccinated.\nYes, they can, and they should. If you wait until a puppy isfully vaccinatedto introduce them to other dogs, it will be too late for them to develop the normal canine social skills and the comfort of being around other dogs that naturally occur when they meet other dogs early on.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nPuppies need to meet other dogs in the range of eight to 14 weeks old and then keep meeting new ones regularly as they are developing into adults. However, most puppies aren’tfully vaccinateduntil they are 16 to 18 weeks old, so if you wait until then, your puppy will be beyond the window when exposure to other dogs does the most good for their development.\nMyth 2: If you comfort them, you’ll reinforce their fear.\nNo, you won’t. Behavior can be reinforced, not emotions. Giving solace to a fearful puppy is both kind and helpful. When they are afraid, whether it’s because of thunder, a charging cat, the giant box in the entryway, or anything else in their world, they need you. Your reassurance and loving manner help them feel more secure and more confident.\nYou offer them feelings of safety when you comfort them. To deprive them of this because of the concern that you might make them more fearful is an idea without merit, so thankfully you can follow the natural impulse to sooth them.\nMyth 3: It’s good to take your puppy running for exercise.\nNo, it’s not. Many dogs grow up to begreat running partners, but puppies should not go running with us. Sustained running is not good for young dogs, especially if they are running on concrete, asphalt, or other hard surfaces. That can be damaging to feet, joints, and other parts of the body.\nPuppies can run around and play, but that is different than going running for an extended time. The age at which dogs can start to run varies based on many factors, including the size of the dog and type of the dog. A common recommendation is not to run with your dog until they are at least nine months to a year old, but it’s essential to consult with your veterinarian for advice about your particular dog.\nIt’s the saddest sound in the world.\nMyth 4: Puppies who live with other dogs know how to get along with dogs and don’t need play dates or other opportunities to meet dogs.\nYes, they do. Even though theother household dogsare a part of teaching a puppy to bedog- social, it’s not sufficient just to know the other dogs they live with.\nDogs who only know the few dogs in their family are likely to be comfortable with those dogs only and not with other dogs. In order to be comfortable with a variety of dogs they knowanddon’t know, they need multiple experiences meeting unfamiliar dogs. That way they learn to be comfortable with dogs in general and not just with a few dogs specifically.\nMyth 5: Puppies need walks starting when you bring them home.\nNo, they don’t. Puppies need exercise, mental stimulation, and attention, which are commonly available on walks, but walks are not the only way to provide them. Many puppies feel overwhelmed by walks and do better with time outside in the yard, play sessions, andfood puzzlesto accomplish the same things that walks do.\nIf your puppy seems to enjoy walks, that’s great and you should absolutely walk them. However, if your puppy needs a little time to adjust before starting a walking routine, it’s also totally fine to ease into walks by using a leash and collar in the house or in the yard or by meandering just one or two houses down the block and then returning home.\nMyth 6: Puppies must meet hundreds of people in the first two months you have them.\nSocialization is the process ofexposing a puppyto a variety of new experiences during the critical period of their lives from three to 14 weeks. The high quality of these experiences is important in a way that high quantity isn’t. What is essential is that your puppy has positive experiences with the people they meet.\nThat means you want people to be calm with them and to offer them treats, play, or petting if they enjoy that physical contact. A handful of experiences that are positive and enjoyable for the puppy are far better for socialization purposes than a large number that the puppy finds overwhelming, scary, confusing, or otherwise unpleasant.\nMyth 7: Puppies should go to the dog park for socialization.\nNo, they shouldn’t. Yes, dogs need to meet other dogs during their socialization period in order to be comfortable around other dogs, including when they are meeting new ones, for the rest of their lives. But thedog park is not the placeto do this. Puppies need to meet dogs one at a time, or in small groups, and these dogs they meet should be carefully chosen.\nA puppy should meet other puppies and nice adult dogs with good social skills so the puppies have a positive experience and learn proper dog social skills. At the dog park, they are likely to become overwhelmed by too many dogs, high arousal dogs, rude dogs, or even aggressive dogs. Taking a puppy to the dog park is far more likely to teach young dogs that other dogs are to be feared than that other dogs make good friends. Also, there is too high a risk of contact with germs at the dog park that can cause serious diseases in puppies.\nHere’s your guide to how treats can help as your new pup is learning all the things.\nMyth 8: Crate training is mean.\nNo, it’s not. Teaching your puppy to be comfortable in a crate is kind. Manydogs love their cratesand feel comfortable in them no matter where they are. A dog who hasbeen crate trainedwill likely feel more comfortable and relaxed when they travel, go to someone else’s house, or must be at the vet or the groomer for longer than just a brief visit. Otherwise, these experiences can be more stressful. Crates should not be used for extended periods of time and certainly not as punishment.\nMyth 9: Puppies and collar/leashes are a natural combo.\nNo, they aren’t, though Isowish they were. Most dogs must betaught to accept collarsand leashes or they will scratch at them or try to shake them off and get away from them. If you start when a puppy is young — two months old or so — by putting a collar on and then later attaching a leash to it, they have an easier time accepting them than if you start when they are significantly older.\nTo make it easier and more comfortable for them to get used to a leash, start withlightweight versionsof both (even possibly acat leashfor small or sensitive pups!) and make sure the collar is not so tight it causes discomfort but not so loose it moves a lot or can be slipped out of. Associate the collar and leash with treats and fun. Always do something they like, such as offer them treats or go outside to walk or play after you put on the collar and leash.\nReferences:\nYou Can’t Reinforce Fear; Dogs and Thunderstorms",

  "page_content": "We’ve all heard the stereotypes like“Yorkies are yappy,” “Pit Bulls are aggressive,”orChihuahuas love tacos. While most pet parents of these breeds agree the labels are far off-base, they persist nonetheless. However, a recent study is hoping to curb some of that thinking. Last week, the science journalSciencepublished findingsthat upend many of these behavioral misnomers.\nThe community science projectDarwin’s Arkwas responsible for much of the data. Researchers examined a compilation of owner surveys, providing info on over 18,000 dogs, as well as sequencing the genomes of nearly 2,200 of them.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n“Dogs are a natural system for investigating the genetics of complex traits. Millions of pet dogs live in human homes, sharing our environment, and receive sophisticated medical care,” reads the study, which was co-authored by 25 scientists. “Behavioral disorders are treated with human psychiatric drugs, achieving similar response rates, and genetic studies suggest shared etiology with some human psychiatric conditions.”\nThese sweet pups need advocates,this National Pit Bull Awareness Month, and always.\nBreed reallydoesn’tinform behavior.\nUltimately, the team found that as little as nine percent of a dog’s behavior can be attributed to their breed. That’sroughly the same ratioof real tuna in a Subway “tuna” sandwich. (For those unaware of its meaty scandal or lucky enough to have avoided the chain altogether, less than one-tenth is not substantial enough to make a difference.)\nSo, what factors impact a dog’s behavior on a more tangible level? “Early socialization, exposure to novelty, training from the get-go,” saysRobert Haussmann,certified dog trainer, founder ofDogboy NYC, andour Collectivemember. “True, clear, and fair leadership — not punishment or alpha dogging — to give a dog clear information about the world that it lives in. That all plays a big role.”\nIt’s important to note that the study was primarily focused on behavior in relation to a dog’s reactions to something they find new or strange — essentially, their level of aggression, a dangerous categorization that can result in misjudged breeds becoming less likely to be adopted, as evidenced by manyPit Bull-type dogs’public image and struggle to find homes. Unfortunately, harmful ideas have a tendency to reinforce themselves and snowball.\n“Pitties in a lot of cities — and I can speak for New York — make up a ton of dogs in our shelter system,” Haussmann explains. “What’s that dog’s early life and socialization? A huge percentage of these dogs could be and should be loving family members.” Of course, according to the study, Pit Bulls did prove to be one of the more human sociable pups — news to no one who’s ever met one. Haussmann also points toward irresponsible breeding as a catalyst for this lingering issue, something Darwin’s Ark notes.\nModern breeds have a history of about 160 years, whereas their evolutionary origin may date back over 10,000 years. And only in the last century and a half have they been primarily bred for appearance rather than functional roles, such as hunting, guarding, and herding. The dedication in some circles to purebred breeding has only escalated this deviation, but even then behavior is not predetermined — as 49 percent of the dogs cataloged in the survey were purebred.\nNow, this might sound a bit contradictory given the last 500ish words, but the data did confirm that a dog’s heritage can play a role in their behavior. The researchers found that around 25 percent of behavioral traits are inherited and according to our expert, that tracks. “That’s how genetics, in general, work. And I think specifically in the world of dogs with their flexible genome, that’s even more inclined,” Haussmann says.\nActress and comedian Rebecca Corry wants to heal society’s messed up relationship with Pit Bulls—starting with this movie.\nDNA testing can tell us a lot.\nWhen you think about all the benefits of testing a dog’s DNA, we know that can be a positive resource. Certain breeds may be more susceptible to allergens or diseases and with that information, we can help prevent them or prepare the best treatment early on.\nHowever, there is one last significant factor to ponder regarding this study. Similar to how you react when hearing your aunt boast about some politician secretly being a lizard person, we have to consider the source. Given most of the information the researchers were working off of is based on survey questions and pet owner testimonials, the data may not be entirely reliable.\nWith that, how should we feel about these findings? According to Haussmann, “What I’d take away from this study reinforced my own observations, which is any dog, regardless of breed, can be fearful, aggressive, anxious, overzealous, stubborn…whatever behavior you’re seeing, it could be a problem with any dog, any breed, any age, any size.” In other words, just as you wouldn’t judge all tuna based on the crap Subway labels as such — don’t judge all dogs of a breed based on the actions of one.",

  "page_content": "If you’ve ever tried to hide treats from your dog, you know they can sniff out chicken, steak, hot dogs,peanut butter, and even a small bit of cookie stuck in the fold of your sweater. Trying to hide anything with an odor from our dogs is pointless. Turns out, one of those things is our stress, andyes, dogs can smell that, too.\nA study led by University of Bristol researchers andpublished this weekfound that dogs experience “emotional cognition” from the scent of human stress, which causes them to make more “pessimistic choices.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nYour pup may know you’re sick before you do, a study says.\nHow we know dogs can smell stress — the 2024 study\nIn this latest study, researchers worked with 18 dogs. They were trained that when a food bowl was placed in one location, there was going to be a treat inside, but if it was placed in another location, it would be empty. After being taught what to expect, scientists pulled a fast one on the dogs (for the sake of science!) and placed a bowl in a new, ambiguous location. Bowls placed in this new location were a mystery to dogs. Would there be a treat there or not?  Researchers observed how quickly it took the dogs to approach the new bowl in the ambiguous location.\nA quick approach toward the bowl reflected “optimism,” while a slow, hesitant approach reflected pessimism or negative emotions. They repeated each trial while exposing the dogs to sweat and breath samples taken from humans when they were either feeling stressed or relaxed. They found that the dogs were slower to approach the bowl in an ambiguous location when they were exposed to the sweat and breath of a stressed-out human.\nWhile this recent study tested the connection between humans’ stress and negative reactions in dogs, a 2022 study already found that dogs can tell the difference between a non-stressed and stressed human.\nThe 2022 study (make people do math):\nClara Wilson, an assistance and working dog researcher at Animal Behaviour Centre, School of Psychology in Belfast, is the lead author of the2022 study“Dogs Can Discriminate Between Human Baseline and Psychological Stress Condition Odors” in the journalPLOS ONE. “We wanted to answer a definitive question: Can dogs tell the difference between two samples [of breath and sweat] from the same person before and after becoming stressed?” Wilson told us at the time that studied was published.\nShe has a background inbio-detection dogs— the ones trained to search samples for human health conditions including cancer, Parkinson’s disease and COVID-19 — but noted: “Whether dogs’ capabilities extend to detecting odors associated with psychological states has been explored far less.”\nThe answer to every (seemingly never-ending) crisis: Dogs.\nFor the sake of science, the 36 people who volunteered to participate in the experiment wiped gauze over the back of their neck, put that gauze into a glass vial, and then exhaled into the vial before sealing it. Next, the experimenters purposefully stressed out the participants, who then put another sample of their sweat and breath into a different vial.\nThe source of the stress? Doing math in public. Specifically, they were asked to count down out loud, from 9,000, by increments of 17, for three minutes without the use of pen and paper. If they gave a correct answer, nobody said anything, but they were called out for making a mistake. Bringing back memories of timed math tests and making you sweat? Thought so.\nThe dogs in the study were pet dogs trained by the researchers to give an alert behavior in response to the scent they were supposed to find. The alert behavior — freezing above the correct sample or sitting down in front of it — allowed the dogs to communicate their ability to tell the odors apart. Wilson shares that she“became very close to the study dogs,” who were pet dogs volunteered by their pet parents from the local community.\nThe dogs had to choose the odor sample given by a person after experiencing stress from a set of samples that also included the baseline sample from that same person, and a “blank” which was a vile containing the kind of gauze used to collect the samples. Based on chance alone — if the dogs were simply guessing — they should have identified the correct odor 33.33 percent of the time. In the experiment, they identified the correct sample 93.75 percent of the time. That means they can distinguish the odor of a person when they are feeling fine from the odorof that same personwhen they are stressed.\nWilson told us: “I was still surprised the first time the dogs were shown the pre- and post-math task samples and confidently discriminated between them. I truly didn’t know if the dogs would interpret these smells as the same, as they had been taken from the same person within four minutes of each other, so it was fascinating to see how accurate the dogs were at discriminating between these odors when the only difference was that a psychological stress response had occurred.”\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nHow this knowledge can inform service-dog training\nIt’s wild to think that dogs can detect the difference in our body chemistry when we are stressed (or calm). “Confirming an odor component to psychological stress may raise further discussion into scent-based training for PTSD or psychiatric service dogs, who are currently often trained to respond to visual signs of distress,”Wilson says.\nIt makes sense to train dogs to offer soothing behaviors in response to odors associated with stress. Possibilities includeasking for pets, offering physical contact, initiating play, or asking to go for a walk. Per Wilson, training service dogs to respond to odor “could also enhance the reaction time of the alert, if the dog is able to respond to the initial onset of the stress response, as opposed to visual signs of distress that may come minutes later.”\nWilson believes “more research is needed on dogs’ ability to discriminate between different emotions, such as stress, fear, and excitement.” Luckily, she will continue to have the best partner she could ask for as she continues her work. “I have a very sweet Red Fox Labrador called Eddie. He loves to do scent games and is a good sport when I want to try out new training ideas or concepts for future discrimination paradigms at home.“\nReferences:\nSmell of Human Stress Affects Dogs’ Emotions Leading Them to Make More Pessimistic Choices\nSmell of Human Stress Affects Dogs’ Emotions Leading Them to Make More Pessimistic Choices\nDogs Can Discriminate Between Human Baseline and Psychological Stress Condition Odours\nDogs Can Discriminate Between Human Baseline and Psychological Stress Condition Odours",

  "page_content": "So, you’re thinking about bringing a dog into your gloriously chaotic family? Maybe you envision idyllic walks in the park with everyone in tow, or cozy movie nights with a pile of fur at your feet (who secretly judges your taste in rom-coms). But let’s be real: Family life is messy, unpredictable, and often involves questionable levels of noise. The last thing you need is a canine who only adds to the stress or doesn’t match your family’s vibe.\nFear not, future pack leader. This guide will help you navigate thedog breedsbest suited for the family circus. After all, some pups are born to fetch Frisbees and snuggle with toddlers, while others would prefer a solo spa day.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nFrom Golden Retrievers to Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, we’re breaking down the best family dog breeds to complete your pack. You can also consider these breeds in mixes when you’re looking at adopting a rescue pup. (And remember: You can findpurebred dogsat rescues these days and should always consider rescuing.)\nBreeds with those squished-in faces are charming — but their health issues are not.\nWhat to look for in a family dog\nTemperament is one of the most important characteristics to consider in a dog breed when you’re welcoming one into your family. Sure, that tiny Chihuahua snoozing on the couch is adorable, but imagine explaining to your tearful toddler for the tenth time that Fido isn’t actually a living teddy bear (spoiler alert: he might not appreciate being hugged like one).\nFamily dogs are the ultimate chill companions, able to handle the whirlwind of emotions and energy that comes with having little humans around. They’re the ones who don’t flinch at the high-pitched shriek of a toy car alarm and happily join in on a game of fetch in the living room, even if it means dodging the occasional rogue Lego brick.\nBasically, they’re the furry equivalent of a comfy pair of sweatpants — adaptable, endlessly patient, and down for whatever adventure (or Netflix marathon) your family throws their way.\nIntelligent andtrainable dogsare eager to please and quick to learn the house rules. They’ll master basic commands in no time, which means less time spent wrestling with a leash and more time enjoying those epic family walks in the park.\nPlus, a smart pup can adapt to your ever-changing family dynamic. Whether it’s a new baby or a house full of rambunctious relatives, they’ll roll with the punches with a smile on their furry face.\nFinding a dog whose energy level matches your family’s is key. An active Golden Retriever will happily join you on hikes and bike rides, while a playful Beagle might be content with a good game of fetch in the backyard. Remember, a tired pup is a well-behaved pup, so choose your canine companion wisely. They’re not just a new family member, they’re your built-in adventure buddy — or cuddle buddy, depending on the day.\nWhen it comes to family dogs, while you don’t necessarily need a dog who’s built like a tank, one resembling a tiny porcelain doll likely won’t be able to withstand the bumps, tumbles, and enthusiastic cuddles that come with young children.\nLook for breeds known for their gentleness and low aggression — think of them as the Mary Poppins of the dog world, practically perfect in every way. Now, that doesn’t mean you can throw caution to the wind. Tiny humans are unpredictable, and even the most patient pup can get overwhelmed. Extra supervision is key, especially with very young children. The golden rule? Never leave even the gentlest dog unattended with a small kid.\nThe dogs — 20 of them puppies — will be available for adoption in the coming weeks.\nTop picks for best family dog breeds\nPit Bull is not a purebred bred but rather abreed type. These types of dogs, known for their muscular builds, blocky heads, and often shorter snouts, are great with kids. Althoughharmful media-perpetuated stereotypeswould have people believe the opposite, Pit Bull-type dogs are gentle, kind, and patient. They havelong been family dogsand (plus!) are in need of rescuing at shelters across the U.S.\nPicture this: Sunshine personified, bounding through the park with your little ones in tow, fur the color of a perfectly toasted marshmallow. That’s the magic of a Golden Retriever. These playful pups are basically the MVPs of the family dog world.\nForget needing a suit of armor — a Golden Retriever’s superpower is their endless patience and goofball energy. They’re down for a game of fetch in the living room, happy to snuggle on the couch for movie night, and built sturdy enough to handle passionate cuddles. They’re guaranteed to bring smiles (and maybe a little slobber) to every member of the family.\nThese enthusiastic retrievers are living proof that happiness comes with a wagging tail and a never-ending capacity for belly rubs. Unlike that delicate crystal vase you inherited, Labs are built tough enough to withstand the playful chaos of family life. They’re goofy, smart, and eager to please, making training a breeze. Basically, a Lab is your family’s personal cheerleader, always up for an adventure, big or small.\nThose looking for a canine companion with an air of royalty can’t go wrong with a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. These little charmers are the perfect lapdog for your mini-monarch, offering endless cuddles and playtime without the boundless energy of a larger breed. While they might not be built for tackling toddlers, Cavaliers are known for their gentle nature and patience, making them a great choice for families with older children.\nBloodhound nose, cuddle-puddle enthusiast: that’s the Beagle in a nutshell. These happy-go-lucky pups bring a joyful energy — and maybe a few enthusiastic howls — to your family fold. Forget needing a jogging buddy who can keep pace with a marathon runner; Beagles are more than content with agood sniffariaround the backyard or a playful romp in the park.\nWhile their independent streak might require a little extra patience during training, a Beagle’s love for their humans is undeniable. Just be prepared for a side effect of endless tail wags, a nose perpetually stuck to the ground, and enough hound dog charm to melt even the grumpiest family member’s heart.\nThese fluffy bundles of joy are like living teddy bears, bringing a touch of elegance to your family life. Unlike a high-strung pup who needs constant exercise, a Bichon Frisé  is perfectly content with some playtime and a snuggle session on the couch. Theirhypoallergenic coatmakes them a great choice for people with allergies — just be prepared for the responsibility ofregular groomingto keep their fluffy coat looking its best.\nThe Havanese is a cuddle champion with a heart of gold, making them one of the best small dog breeds for families. Don’t be fooled by their small size, these pups are playful and energetic, keeping up with your kids for a game of fetch or a backyard adventure. They also have a hypoallergenic coat in case you have family members with allergies.\nLooking for a canine companion who’s equal parts elegance and goofball? Look no further than the English Setter. These graceful athletes areall about the zoomies, making them the perfect playmate for active families. While their boundless energy might require an outlet, their gentle nature and eagerness to please make training easy. Keep in mind that they are on the larger side, so you’ll want to be mindful of their energy around small children.\nCollies are the ultimate family dogs, known for their intelligence, loyalty, and protective nature. These majestic pups are like having your own personal nanny, always happy to keep an eye on your little ones. They’re eager to please and quick to learn, making them a great fit for families looking for a trainable companion.\nDon’t let their fancy haircuts fool you; these dogs are all about fun and family. Poodles come in three sizes (standard, miniature, and toy) so you can pick the perfect one for your crew. With their hypoallergenic coat, they’re another great choice if you have family members with allergies.\nSure, they might require regular grooming to maintain their signature poof, but think of it as a bonding experience (and who knows, maybe you'll pick up some styling tips for yourself along the way).\nAny of these breeds are great for city living and available at shelters and rescues.\nEvaluate your unique needs\nBefore you dive headfirst into the world of adorable puppy pictures, it’s important to take a moment to consider your own family’s needs. Sure, a fluffy Saint Bernard might look cuddly, but is your living room prepared for a personal avalanche of fur every shedding season?\nThis isn’t just about picking the cutest dog — it’s about finding the perfect companion whocomplements your lifestyle. Think about your activity level. Are you weekend warriors or couch potatoes? Apartment dwellers might need a pup withlower exercise requirementsthan a family with a sprawling backyard. And don’t forget to factor in any allergies or special needs within the family. Some breeds require more grooming than others, and some have specific needs that might not mesh well with your family dynamic.\nUltimately, choosing a family dog is a big decision. By taking the time to evaluate your priorities, you’ll ensure you find a pack member who brings joy, laughter, and the perfect amount of slobbery kisses to your family for years to come.\nSpoiler: It’s not about the breed. But these pupsarepretty brainy.\nFAQs (people also ask):\nSeveral family-friendly breeds are known for minimal shedding, including Poodles (standard, miniature, and toy), Bichon Frisé, Havanese, and even the playful Beagle (though their short fur might still require regular brushing). Remember, even hypoallergenic breeds may require regular grooming to maintain their coats.\nWhile size doesn’t always dictate temperament, some smaller breeds are well-suited for families. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Bichon Frisés, and Havanese offer playful personalities and gentle natures ideal for children. If you crave a cuddly companion who won’t shed much, these pups might be your perfect match. Remember, even smaller breeds have exercise needs, so consider your family's activity level when choosing your dog.\nGolden Retrievers and Labrador Retrievers are classic choices formedium-sized family dogs, with their playful spirit, endless patience, and trainability. If activity is your family's middle name, consider an English Setter. Their boundless energy is a perfect match for energetic families. Collies, with their intelligence and loyalty, are practically nannies-in-training, while Beagles bring a happy-go-lucky charm and a manageable size to your family adventures.\nTemperament can vary within breeds, and training plays a huge role. However, some breeds are generally known for their eagerness to please and trainability, making them shine in well-managed households.\nGolden Retrievers and Labrador Retrievers are superstars, while Poodles impress with their intelligence. For a smaller option, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are gentle and affectionate. Remember, any breed (or mix) can be a great family dog with the right training and love.\nReferences:\nDogs Supporting Human Health and Well-Being: A Biopsychosocial Approach\nDogs Supporting Human Health and Well-Being: A Biopsychosocial Approach\nHighly Heritable and Functionally Relevant Breed Differences in Dog Behaviour\nHighly Heritable and Functionally Relevant Breed Differences in Dog Behaviour\nMood-Boosting Power of Dogs\nMood-Boosting Power of Dogs\nPosition Statement on Pit-Bulls\nPosition Statement on Pit-Bulls",

  "page_content": "There’s nothing dog parents bond over more than being dog parents. The first time you arrange a one-on-one pup playdate with someone you meet at the dog park? Magic. And yet, when it comes to people and their dogs, emotions often run high. But the second there’s a squabble between dogs, or a fellow dog parent doesn’t like how something’s been handled, things can turn sour.\nEven something as minor as telling someone you think their dog is playing too rough can cause them to get defensive and lash out. “Criticizing someone’s dog’s behavior is as risky as criticizing a child’s behavior to their parent,” saysKimberly Best, dispute resolution expert and founder ofBest Conflict Solutions. “People have a lot of emotional investment in their perception of their dog and their dog parenting.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nSo, how should you address issues with other dog parents at the park? The first thing you have to do is build a rapport with the person whose behavior or whose dog’s behavior you would like to see change. “Think of relationships with people as investments,” Best says. “We are like banks: In order to make a withdrawal — in the form of feedback or criticism — we first need to make some deposits by building connection and trust. It will almost never work to walk up to a stranger and criticize them.”\nNew kid on the block? Follow this trainer’s tips before letting your pet run wild.\nStart with a baseline relationshipbeforeyou address conflict.\nOf course, building a rapport with someone can be tough, especially in the aftermath of an incident involving your dog, when all you want to do is say your piece, but it is essential if you want to create lasting change.\nOnce you establish a rapport with another dog parent — which could take minutes or months, depending on the people involved — Best suggests you ask the person if they are receptive to feedback. If they say yes, “make sure to let them know that the issue is something thatyouare experiencing as a problem, and you needtheirhelp to try to understand it and resolve it,” Best says. “Language that is blaming or finger-pointing is guaranteed to earn a defensive response, so make sure you maintain a calm demeanor and don’t escalate the problem with your tone, body language, or word choice.”\nBest adds that it’s also important not to expect a particular response from that person but to just communicate the best you can and hope they respond in turn: “We may not get the response we wanted at that time, but a seed has been planted, and people almost always consider what they heard later, after their initial emotional reaction wears off.”\nThere’s a lot more to it than sniffing each other’s butts.\nFigure out what the problem is (and whose it is).\nIt’s also important to consider whether the problem really is theirs or yours. Inher bookThe Dance of Anger, author and clinical psychologist Dr. Harriet Lerner says the person with the problem is the one responsible for solving that problem.\nYou can’t just go up to someone with a list of grievances and expect them to see things your way and then change to suit you. Even if you think you’re in the right. Even if most people would agree with you. Even if the person in question is breaking some written or unwritten dog park rule, likenot picking uptheir dog’s poop or letting their dog go on anunchecked humping spree.\nIf you want change, it’s much easier to change yourself than someone else. If you don’t want your dog to get humped, remove them. If you don’t like seeing dog poop in the dog run, offer a bag to the dog’s parent, and if they decline, go pick it up yourself. Or let it go. Often these are your only realistic options if you want to avoid a conflict. Especially in the minimally-regulated space that is the dog park, where rules may lack legal enforceability.\n“Rules posted at public dog parks are typically guidelines rather than legally enforceable regulations,” saysFrank Leyton, a California-based personal injury lawyer specializing in dog attacks. “Local ordinances may support these rules and failure to comply could result in fines or other penalties,” Leyton says. But unless the violation is witnessed by someone with the authority to address these issues directly and dole out punishments, it is going to fall to you to gather evidence, take statements, file a report, and follow up until the issue is resolved.\nThe situation is similar inprivate dog parks, like those in gated communities. “The rules are often enforceable under the community’s regulations,” Leyton says. “[And] violation of these rules can result in penalties outlined in the community’s bylaws, which may include fines or even barring access to the park.” But, again, achieving this result will probably require work on your part.\nIf that’s work you want to do, by all means, proceed. But your end goal might be better and more efficiently achieved by getting to know the other person and taking it from there. In that case, “keep in mind that in a park-like setting, being scrutinized in front of others could be embarrassing,” says etiquette expertLisa Miraz Groats. If you want the person to be receptive to your concerns, it is probably best to deliver them in private, assuming you feel safe doing so.\nRichard Rosenthal is protecting animals who have historically gone underrepresented in the criminal justice system. These are his stories.\nHandle fallout from the conflict with grace.\nOf course, even if you do everything “right” the other person could still get offended and lash out. In that case, Best recommends you apologize. “Say, ‘I’m sorry to offend you’ and acknowledge that the feedback is hard to hear and that hearing it would be difficult for you too,” Groats says. “Let them know that your intent wasn’t to cause a problem.”\nAnd if they are still angry, walk away. Your safety and the safety of your dog are what matters. This can be a hard pill to swallow, especially if the issue you are bringing up is one of safety — if you feel like you, your dog, or others in the park are at risk. For instance, this could be an issue of a dog who is hurting other dogs at the park. In that case, the most expeditious and realistic action you can take is probably to remove your dog from the situation. Perhaps permanently.\nYes, you may need to give up on this park, even if this is the only time of day that you can come. Even if it’s the closest park to your house. Even if you like talking to all the other dog parents that go at that time, and your dog is always so excited to see their dog friends. You have to prioritize what is best for your dog over preferences and convenience.\nA dog behaviorist schools us on why puppy classes are more about socializing than getting straight As.\nWho’s responsible if a dog gets attacked?\nThat said, it’s certainly not your fault if a dog belonging to a person you don’t know shows up at the park and attacks your dog. Or if a dog they have always been friendly with suddenly gets too rough, and it lands them at the vet. Whatever the case, the parent of the attacking dog isusuallylegally responsible for their dog’s actions, according to Leyton.\n“If a dog injures another dog, the owner may be liable for the veterinary bills and other damages associated with the injury,” he says. Same if the dog attacks a person. In California, the “strict liability statute (Civil Code Section 3342) holds dog owners responsible for bites, regardless of the dog’s prior behavior or the owner's knowledge of such behavior.” This may not necessarily be the case in other states, though, so it is important to research your local legislation to make sure you understand the specifics of the laws in your area.\nGetting money out of a person whose dog attacked you or your dog can be extremely difficult, so make sure it’s worth the trouble. “If the injuries are severe, involve significant medical expenses, or if there is a recurring issue with the dog or owner, taking legal steps is advisable,” Leyton says. “[But] If the injuries are minor, and the owner is cooperative in resolving the issue, formal legal action may be unnecessary.”\nIn order to hold the person legally responsible, Leyton advises taking the following steps in the wake of the incident:\nDocument the incident by gathering evidence, such as photos, videos, and witness statements.\nDocument the incident by gathering evidence, such as photos, videos, and witness statements.\nObtain and preserve medical records if injuries are involved.\nObtain and preserve medical records if injuries are involved.\nAfter receiving medical attention, report the dog bite injury to the local animal control agency or law enforcement.\nAfter receiving medical attention, report the dog bite injury to the local animal control agency or law enforcement.\nContact the dog’s parent and attempt to resolve the issue directly.\nContact the dog’s parent and attempt to resolve the issue directly.\nIf necessary, file a claim or consult a personal injury attorney for further legal action.\nIf necessary, file a claim or consult a personal injury attorney for further legal action.\nOf course, getting someone’s personal information out of them at such a time can be difficult, so Best suggests a gentle approach, something like, “Hey, can we exchange contact information so I can follow up with you about this later?” Then, when you get the vet bill, reach out and say something like, “The story that I’m telling myself around having this added expense, is that since your dog bit mine, you have some responsibility for the bill. What are your thoughts on that?”\nBest says that if you phrase it this way, it “leaves out blame and ‘shoulds’ and tells the other person, ‘this is how the world looks for me.’” “People are actually quite receptive to hearing things that way, because you are taking ownership of your expectations. All you can do is ask.\nBut asking means that people have the right to say no, so be careful not to set high expectations for their response. Also, be willing to negotiate. Maybe they don’t want to pay all of it, but they’d be willing to pay some of it. Lastly, people’s first response to an ask is often no, so respond with something like, ‘I’d appreciate it if you gave it some thought. Please follow up with me if you change your mind.’ People often do change their mind when given the space to do so.” And if they don’t come around, you can always take them to court if you really think it is worth it.\nTeach your pup a perfect recall so you can be sure they will come back, no matter what.\nYou may still have to see the other dog parent. Here’s how to deal with that.\nYou may find yourself facing a long and fruitless battle, though. And in the meantime you will probably still have to deal with this person and their dog at the park, if you keep going there. Fortunately, it likely won’t be much of an issue. “There are few actual ‘jerks’ in the world,” Best says. “People are usually either unaware of a situation or unskilled in how to handle it and you’ll have better results dealing with them if you start off assuming the best, not the worst.”\nIn the meantime, if you are going to let your dog off-leash in a public place, make sure they are trained to return to you promptly when called. Good recall is probably your most powerful tool for keeping them safe. And keeping them safe is what this is really all about.\nReferences:\nCalifornia Civil Code",

  "page_content": "Anyone who has gotten a few extra snuggles from their pup while feeling down could tell you that dogs seem to be able to pick up on our mental states. The science backs it up, too: Previous studies have found that dogs are more likely toapproach a crying strangerthan their own guardian anddogs’ cortisol levels riseafter hearing human infants cry.\nBut until now, most of the established research has focused on dogs in isolation, without comparing them to other animals.A new studypublished inAnimal Behaviourfound that dogs react to the sounds of humans crying in ways that are distinct from other animals, showing that pups may have evolved to understand human emotions during the domestication process.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nCue the Phoebe Bridgers—your pup may just soak up your tears.\nThe study\nResearchers recruited pet dogs and pet pigs from seven countries; in the end, 30 dogs and 22 pigs were studied. They chose to use domesticated pigs and dogs so they could compare two different animals raised with humans — that way, they could determine if dogs simply learn human emotion during their lives through proximity to people, or if there is a genetic component.\nResearchers tested each animal twice. Once, they played the animals a recording of a human crying; the other time, they played a recording of a human humming. The researchers found that dogs showed signs of stress — includingshaking and whining— more often when they heard a human crying. They also physically touched their pet parents more often when they heard the sounds of crying. Regardless of the stimulus type, dogs more quickly looked at and approached their pet parent than pigs did.\nOn the other hand, pigs seemed to find humming more stressful. They showed signs of stress, such as rapid ear flicking, more often when they heard humming than when they heard than crying. “This suggests that pigs did not match their emotional state with the human sounds they heard,” wrote Fanni Lehoczki, the study’s lead author.\nResearch finds that your pup can smell when you’ve been doom-scrolling, and they get bummed out.\nThese stress responses show that, rather than being a learned behavior, understanding human emotion may be a result of evolution during the domestication process — which pigs, animals that have traditionally been kept as livestock by humans, haven’t undergone yet.\nResearchers add, though, that pigs are highly sensitive (we’ve all seenBabe), and we shouldn’t use these results to count them out. It’s possible that pigs were simply confused by the humming sound and unable to understand its emotional significance (or lack of) — but thatdoesn’tnecessarily mean they aren’t equally caring creatures.\n“We don’t say that pigs can’t do [emotional contagion],” Paula Pérez Fraga, the study’s co-author, toldNature.“The story is really about how good dogs were; not how bad pigs were.”\nReferences:\nEmpathic-Like Responding By Domestic Dogs (Canis familiaris) to Distress in Humans: an Exploratory Study\nEmpathic-Like Responding By Domestic Dogs (Canis familiaris) to Distress in Humans: an Exploratory Study\nEmotional Contagion: Dogs and Humans Show a Similar Physiological Response to Human Infant Crying\nEmotional Contagion: Dogs and Humans Show a Similar Physiological Response to Human Infant Crying\nFamily Pigs’ and Dogs’ Reactions to Human Emotional Vocalizations: a Citizen Science Study\nFamily Pigs’ and Dogs’ Reactions to Human Emotional Vocalizations: a Citizen Science Study",

  "page_content": "As someone who works remotely, I have a serious at-home office setup. It includes a large desk holding multiple monitors with the type of elaborately comfy chair previously reserved for Twitch streamers. The downside to these long-sought-after luxuries is that I rarely use them because my dog can’t get close enough to me when I do. If I don’t sit on the couch, bed, or somewhere else she can curl up next to me all day, she will have a full-on emotional meltdown.\nBeyond increasing my back pain by about 5,000 percent, two things have become abundantly clear from this routine. One, I am a very weak man when faced with a sad dog. And two, my pup is way too attached. So, I enlisted the counsel of two experts to help reduce my dog’s clinginess at home.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nYour dog’s Velcro habits are cute—but not always convenient.\nWhy some dogs stick to your side\nThere are copious reasons why your dog may possess Velcro-like qualities. Susan Nilson, animal trainer and founder ofThe Cat and Dog House, confirms that this behavior is completely normal and, in many cases, just reflects how much they like you (aww).\nHowever, she offers an important caveat: “There is such a thing as being over-attached.” Nilson explains that dogs will often follow their pet parents around simply because they like being near them and are curious about what they’re up to.\nThese animals could also be anticipating something exciting like being fed or going for a walk. Not to mention, if they follow you around all day, they’re more likely to receive pets or other types of attention, which only leads them to repeat this behavior. So, as difficult as it can feel, it’s imperative to resist rewarding this behavior and other neediness staples,like whining.\nOn a less charming note, your pup might be clinging to you because they’re stressed or scared. As the one who takes care of them, they look to you for protection and reassurance.\n“Dogs, like children, tend to use their owners as a secure base, a bit like a security blanket,” Nilson says. Dr. Sabrina Kong, a veterinarian atJules Veterinary Centerin Tracy, California, explains that a lack of confidence or recent changes to their environment could be factors, as well.\n“Some dogs become clingy if they’re not used to being alone or experienced loss or change, such as moving to a new home or changing the family dynamic,” she says. In short, maybe you should stay togetherfor the kids.\nIf they’re following you around like your shadow, there’s a reason for that.\nAin’t no sunshine when you’re gone\nOf course, if this behavior is consistent every day, there’s likely a larger issue at play. Your pup could be suffering from separation anxiety, a condition I think we all know alittle too well. Unfortunately, Nilson notes that remedying this situation and managing its symptoms can be a delicate dance. According to the trainer, “separation anxiety needs a carefully structured approach to build up the length of time the dog can manage alone without being stressed.”\nAbove all, she recommends hiring a professional to help guide you and your dog through the process. But if you’re unable to do so due to time constraints or because you spent all your excess money on pain relief medication for your back, like me, the overarching goal is to help your pup feel safe when they’re alone.\nFor Nilson, this ideally involves a carefully tailored plan of desensitization and counterconditioning, in which you gradually increase the length of time your dog spends alone while rewarding calm and independent behavior.\nBut it’s important to remember that dog training is not a Vin Diesel movie and speed should not be the goal. “There is no timeline for this. We simply go at the dog’s pace and need to resist any temptation to rush things along,” she adds.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nShort-term solutions\nThat approach is all fine and dandy, but in the interim, most of us still have things to do, places to go, and backs to have massaged. Thankfully, there are short-term Band-Aid solutions to help limit this behavior in the present so you can still get some work done.\nNilson explains that providing amentally stimulating toyis often the best option in these scenarios. Offering your dog something like a snuffle mat or fillable toy will help keep them occupied while you do the dishes, exercise, or work to pay for their special tummy-sensitive dog food.\nNilson specificallysuggests a Kongor LickiMat;  they can be filled and frozen overnight to pose a greater and longer-lasting challenge. She explains that these tools arenatural stress relieversthat give pups a boost of endorphins. “When dogs are presented with a task where they have to engage their logical, thinking brain, it inhibits the emotional brain, meaning not only will they be happily distracted but also that they will be calmer and more relaxed overall.”\nEstablishing a scent game is another effective strategy to keep your dog occupied. Plus, Nilson points out that this can be done in a separate room apart from the one you’re trying to be productive in. These games involve scattering or hiding treats and allowing your pup to use their nose to find them.\nIt might even improve their health, as Nilson explains: “Research shows that sniffing lowers a dog’s pulse rate and blood pressure so this is another easy way to provide a mental challenge which will help keep your dog distracted and calm.”\nOther options include offering your dog something with your scent on it to provide additional comfort. Personally, I stopped lending clothes after losing my vintageGet Up Kidst-shirt to an ex, but I can make an exception here. “Dogs feel more secure when surrounded by their familiar scents and this is an easy way to help your dog feel more secure if they’re feeling anxious,” Nilson says. She also mentions dog-specific music or playlists you can find on YouTube or Spotify as effective tools to help further induce calmness.\nWhat to do when you don’t feel the close bond you want.\nHow to train your dog to be slightly more independent\nIf your dog was recently adopted or is still a puppy, you may be able to takeThe Terminatorroute and stop these issues before they ever develop. Dr. Kong explains that preventing this behavior requires proper socialization and training early on.\n“Encouraging independence, rewarding calm behavior, and avoiding reinforcing needy behavior inadvertently are crucial. Ensure your dog has a well-rounded life with plenty of social interactions, physical exercise, and mental stimulation,” she says.\nAdditionally, an early focus on commands like “stay” or “go to bed” will help teach your pet that being away from you is normal.I get it — it can behard to say goodbyewhen you leave, and coming home to a dog losing their mind about your resumed presence is a singularly wonderful experience. But Dr. Kong confirms these habits are not always in your pup’s best interest long-term. “It’s also fundamental to practice leaving and returning home without making a big fuss, which can help minimize anxiety related to your comings and goings,” she says.\nThe appeal of clingy dogs is clear: Everybody likes to feel needed. But it’s important to remember that it’s in everyone’s best interest if your pet can be a bit more independent. If not for them, do it for the health of your back.

They can lick their lips after eating something delicious, or when they’ve just caught a whiff of something delicious (cue the drool!).\nDogs can groom themselves after getting settled in bed for the evening — think of it as their nighttime bath. But pet parents should take note of excessive licking. This can be a sudden uptick in their normal amount, or if you find you are constantly asking them to stop. Excessively licking their lips or their body could be due to one of many underlying issues:\nNausea\nNausea\nAcid reflux\nAcid reflux\nStress or anxiety\nStress or anxiety\nDental pain or other oral disease\nDental pain or other oral disease\nToxin ingestion or oral irritation\nToxin ingestion or oral irritation\nNeurological disorders (sometimes seen as licking the air or biting at imaginary flies)\nNeurological disorders (sometimes seen as licking the air or biting at imaginary flies)\nAllergies or pests\nAllergies or pests\nHere are four common dental problems your pup might face and how to treat them.\nWhen to seek veterinary help\nIf you are noticing any of the following in your dog, especially if it is an acute or sudden change and it is happening for more than a day or so, it might be a good idea to contact your veterinarian:\nExcessive lip licking, especially if accompanied by excessive drooling, panting, or a wet chin/neck\nExcessive lip licking, especially if accompanied by excessive drooling, panting, or a wet chin/neck\nExcessive lip licking with burping or swallowing frequently\nExcessive lip licking with burping or swallowing frequently\nLicking when being greeted by strangers or in new environments\nLicking when being greeted by strangers or in new environments\nExcessive licking of the lips or mouth when eating, especially when accompanied by sneezing\nExcessive licking of the lips or mouth when eating, especially when accompanied by sneezing\nLicking the air or biting at imaginary flies\nLicking the air or biting at imaginary flies\nExcessively licking their body or feet, especially when accompanied by red paws or irritation on the skin\nExcessively licking their body or feet, especially when accompanied by red paws or irritation on the skin\nA journal or log of your dog’s licking is a helpful way to help your vet identify patterns of these behaviors. For example, if your dog is excessively licking their lips overnight or early in the morning before breakfast, this may help your vet identify the problem quicker.\nIt’s also a great idea to check your dog’s environment for any signs of mischief. For example, any chewed house plant leaves or wires, which could be the culprit in cases where a dog starts licking excessively very suddenly. The more information you can provide your veterinarian, the easier it may be to help get to the bottom of the issue.\nHere’s what works (and what doesn’t).\nFAQs (People also ask):\nExcessive licking of the feet and paws are often due to one of two things: allergies or stress. Dogs’ feet can be itchy as a result of allergies — to their food, to things in the environment (grasses, pollens, etc), or pests. Oftentimes, this is accompanied by red or irritated skin elsewhere on their body, excessive itchiness, ear or skin infections, or sometimes, frequent soft stool.\nA dog can keep licking their lips for a lot of reasons. They can lick from drooling, which can be a result of smelling something yummy or even nausea. Dogs can lick their lips when getting settled in their bed for the night and getting comfortable. However, if you notice it is excessive, it could be an indication of something more serious.\nDogs that lick their lips and swallow particularly at night could have underlying digestive issues. This is especially true if it is accompanied by vomiting or regurgitation in the middle of the night or early in the morning before breakfast.

  "page_content": "Over a year ago, I brought home a puppy. My husband and I sleep-trained her, helped her master potty training, and taught her how to sit on cue and how to fetch. Because we’d taken on the responsibility of caring for a living thing and because she’s so cute, we’ve done everything in our power to give her a shot at that elusive thing we humans are always after: happiness.\nWhen it was obvious that she didn’t like her puppy food, we scrambled tofind food toppersthat would accommodate her taste. When she made it clear that she preferred to sleep on one bed over the other, we sold the offending mattress and got her a second version of the one she likes.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhen she made it extremely clear that she hated car rides, we worked in incremental steps to reduce her fear around the big four-wheeled monster. And when that didn’t totally work, we invested in anti-nausea andanti-anxiety medicationsto ease her discomfort. We are, we like to think, doting parents to our only child.\nBut something has been nagging at us, especially as we stare into her perfect, fur-trimmed eyes and wonder what is going on in that tiny brain of hers: Does she suffer from the thing that so often gets in the way of human happiness? That is, is she lonely, and she simply can’t tell us? Are we, our dog’s biological mother and father (don’t bother telling us otherwise), enough for her? Or does she need adoggie social life? Or, better, do we need to get a dog for our dog?\nA few things to consider before expanding your fam by four more paws.\nWhat does science say about loneliness in dogs?\nThough there is a lot of literature ondogs’ impactonhuman loneliness,there isn’t muchresearch on dog loneliness specifically. The closest thingwe have is researchby Dr. Noah Snyder-Mackler, an associate professor at the School of Life Sciences at Arizona State University (ASU). His team found that “social connectedness,” either with humans or fellow dogs — was the biggest predictor of a dog’s longevity. However, the study researched social connectedness among several other key factors in a dog’s life, so if or how dogs experience loneliness wasn’t isolated for study.\nThe one thing we do know is that dogs are social animals, evolutionarily speaking. They worked collaboratively to survive. Dr. Vanessa Spano, director of veterinary services at the ASPCA Adoption Center in New York City, tells us that what we lack in clinical studies on dog loneliness, we can just begin to make up for in thestudy of dog evolution.\n“Although Fluffy the Shih Tzu is not a wolf, her ancestors in the wild did cooperative breeding so that they could further their genetics, and they also hunted together for food,” Dr. Spano says. “It was more beneficial for them to be in a group so that they could detect predators. So we have all of this evidence that dogs are not supposed to be socially isolated species.”\nThere aren’t great studies on loneliness in dogs specifically, so it’s difficult to say that just because they were pack animals at the beginning of their evolutionary journey, they still rely on those specific relationships and dynamics today. They could very well be content and fulfilled by different kinds of relationships.\nJanet Cutler founder ofLandmark Behaviour Inc.in Toronto, puts it this way: “We know that [dogs] were descended from wolves. They lived in packs, so they are a very, very social species, but they've been domesticated for [an estimated] 30,000 years. And during that time, they have spent time with people. So for many dogs, as long as they have a social partner or social interactions with people or dogs, they’re quite satisfied.”\nSo here’s the short answer: I, a pet parent, could very well be “enough” for my dog. But there are just a few other things that I should consider before I say “Great!” and move on to picking out theright ice cream flavorfor my dog’s next treat.\nLet the games begin.\nDr. Spano acknowledges the limits we have in identifying “markers” for dog loneliness and notes that we don’t have a great rubric for assessing whether or not a dog is experiencing the feeling. “We do know, though, that chronic loneliness can lead to depression in people or can lead to anxiety, and we do have better markers of those things in dogs,” she says.\nFirst, here’s what you want to see on the pet cam when you’re away, according to Cutler: “Most dogs, what they would do is they spend some time lying down. They might get up and go get a drink of water, look out the window, go back and do something, play with a toy for a few minutes, go back and lie down. So, what we want to be seeing is some movement, some interaction throughout the day.”\nSeparation anxiety,on the other hand, can look like panting, vocalization including barking or whining, and fixating on the closed door. More severe signs are scratching the door or, in the crate, bent bars or drool. If you leave your dog with another person and the dog continues to whine, bark, pace, and struggle to calm down, then that’s an indication of anxiety in the pup.\nClinicalsigns of depression in dogslook similar to what it looks like in humans: lethargy, disinterest in walks, playing, food, and other things that they once enjoyed. (Cutler suggests ruling out a medical issue first. If a veterinarian can’t find anything physically wrong, then it could be depression).\n“We don’t want to be seeing the dog just lying there and not doing anything. Or alternatively, we don’t want to be seeing any signs of really high anxiety,” Cutler adds.\nGet out the toys and puzzles.\n“It’s important to remember dogs as individuals, just like people as individuals,” Dr. Spano says. “And so there are some dogs that are just going to tolerate loneliness way better than others.”\nHow they experience being left along is based on several factors, from genetics to their early experiences. One dog may be fine chilling for ten hours a day, while a second dog in the same household is having a terrible time being left for one hour.\nIf they’re pathologically attached and then isolated from their human for any period of time it is likely difficult for the dog. You can work with a trainer to desensitize them to those periods of alone time and also look into medications that would ease their stress, Dr. Spano says.\nSometimes, it’s not an attachment issue, but, instead, it’s boredom, loneliness’s more mischievous cousin. Boredom can be identified by general up-to-no-good behaviors, like running around,counter surfing, knocking stuff down, and rummaging around things they shouldn’t be rummaging around. It can be just lying down, sleeping all day.\n“And there’s a lot of things we can do to help with boredom and give dogs things to do while we’re away, but being a little bored isn’t always the worst thing,” Cutler says. In these cases, moreenrichment activitiescan be helpful. Puzzles. Toys. Kongs. The works.\nIf your dog’s issue is more “isolation distress,” which is anxiety expressed when left alone, but without the attachment issue, a doggie daycare or pet sitter would be a good option for your dog. And if they have isolation distressanda fear of other dogs — not an uncommon combo, according to Dr. Spano! — then skip the daycare and hire the pet sitter.\nIf a dog exhibits fear around other dogs, you don’t have to push them to interact with other dogs for their health, but you can alwayswork on their behaviorfor safety and lifestyle reasons.\nTrain your dog to stay calm when they’re on their own — instead of sad-singing“All By Myself”until you come home.\nWhether they do or do not have issues being left alone, how do we know our dogs are craving doggie interactions? Observing a dog’s interactions with both humans and other dogs can offer clues about how much they want or need puppy playdates.\n“For some dogs, they really like spending time with their people,” Cutler says. “Those are the dogs that if you’re going out for a walk, they could care less if another dog is approaching them or interacting with them. They don’t need or want that interaction with other dogs. Other dogs really, really, really like their dog friends, and they have a really good time with them.”\nIf your dog falls in the latter camp, to get more play in their life, Dr. Spano recommends setting up small groups or one-on-ones with pups your dog likes. You’ll be able to tell it’s all going well because theyassume the play positionand wag their tail.\nShe’s more hesitant torecommend dog parks, though. Theparks can be crowded, dogs can feel pinned in, you maybe don’t know who will show up. Sometimes it can become a social thing for humans, so they miss their dog’s cues, or they just don’t know their dog’s cues well. There can be aggression that can lead to dogs developing fears about socializing.\n“I think that there’s some dogs that love the dog park, and they love seeing their friends and running around,” Dr. Spano says, but recognizes this isn’t true for all dogs. “When I was little, I had a lot of social anxiety, and I hated going to kindergarten and whatever because I just wanted to be with my mom and not with other kids because I was nervous. And it’s the same with other dogs. They’re stuck in a small, confined area with other dogs that maybe are really too rambunctious for them.”\nIn short, dog parks can be a Wild West situation and that can up your dog’s anxiety instead of reducing it. The one-on-one or small group playdates in wide open spaces is a great way to get that socialization in a positive environment.\nEverything you need to know to get your new addition off to a good start.\nSo… second dog?\nI’m a second child, so I tend to bristle when parents frame having a second baby as a plaything for the first kid. But I’ll save that conversation for therapy. Ihavetalked to my husband about a second dog just because we love the one we have so much, and she has some light separation anxiety. We thought maybe a companion could extend the amount of time she’s at home without us. This, it turns out, isn’t always the best idea.\nDr. Spano doesn’t recommend getting a second dog as the antidote for separation anxiety. Since it’s usually a pathological hyper-attachment issue that causes separation anxiety, no matter how many potential friends you put in your dog’s general vicinity, he or she will likely continue to fixate on you.\n“It’s just like a person who could be in a big city or in a room with a lot of people, but they still feel lonely,” Dr. Spano says.\nAnd as Cutler points out, getting a second dog to ease the first dog’s perceived loneliness could backfire, too. “Keep in mind that if your dog really loves your attention, they’re very likely to get less attention from you if you have to split it between multiple animals,” she says. “So, if your dog is very, very attached to you and likes spending a lot of time with you, they may or may not appreciate having another dog in the home just because they won’t be getting that same level of attention.”\nLikewise, if you ware able to give your dog the best life as you possibly can as it is, it might be wise to stick to one dog. Cutler suggests considering whether you can walk two dogs at once or whether you’re planning to add to your family. Dogs can be boisterous together, which can be tough around babies. She offers up an example from her own life. She has two dogs as well as three kids, and the entire family can’t always go places together, due to the cold, hard fact of car space. They all simply won’t fit, and so the dogs may get left at home for certain trips.\n“So, if your dog loves doing things with your family, but having a second dog might mean that they can’t,” she says. “It’s little things like that and really paying attention to how what you and your dog enjoy now will be affected by it.”\nThere is, in short, a lot to consider before going for two or more pups. But, after you run the numbers, and it does make sense for your and the dog’s lifestyle to adopt another, then there are smart ways to go about it. “If it’s possible first, don't bind yourself to this new dog,” Dr. Spano says. “Maybe do a trial foster period.” (That said, it’s also a great idea tofoster a second dogin the long-term — if that’s a fit for your other dog — to help with thecrisis of overcrowdingin U.S. shelters).\nKnow that introductions will take time.Introduce dogs to each otherin a neutral area, with one handler per dog, and with dogs on a leash for control. Keep an eye ontheir body language,and remove any sources of competition like toys, bowls for food, and other resources. When they’re sharing the same space, don’t leave them unsupervised in the same area until you can be sure they have a good relationship.\n7 signs your pup and their pal have BFF potential.\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer.\nIn the end, there haven’t been enough studies to know whether dogs experience loneliness, and, if they do, how it expresses itself and how to mitigate it. Even though I think I know everything my dog is trying to telepathically communicate to me, I don’t. But if they’re not struggling with other, more easily identifiable issues, like depression, anxiety, or boredom, then it’s perfectly possible that your dog is just fine. You’re enough, and your dog is getting enough social time with other dogs. Sorelax. And go play a round a fetch with your pup.\n“It’s just not assuming that your dog is necessarily lonely if you do have to be away,” Cutler says. “It’s really looking at their behavior, looking at how they’re acting with you and making a decision from that. Because a lot of people do feel guilty about leaving their pets alone, and yet many of them are OK. I mean, you don’t want to be gone 12 hours a day every day. That might be hard on them. But having a little bit of time alone can be good.\nReferences:\nSocial Determinants of Health and Disease in Companion Dogs: a Cohort Study from the Dog Aging Project",

  "page_content": "As someone with a Pit Bull who would rather hold in her pee for 18 hours than go outside when it’s barely drizzling, I can confirm dogs are mostly big babies. No matter how tough they may seem or present themselves to other pups, I’ve never met a pet parent whose dog didn’t have at least one quirky phobia. Sure, everybody knows that dogs are easily spooked byfireworks, thunderstorms, or a trip to the vet. But for many, those are simply a baseline.\n“Dogs, like any animal, have the potential to become afraid of anything,” explains Renee Rhoades, applied animal behaviorist atR+Dogs. While some of these fears can certainly reflect larger behavioral concerns, Rhoades notes that others develop mainly because they’re unfamiliar to the animal.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n“Contrary to popular belief, dogs do not become afraid of things simply from negative interactions with them. They can also become afraid of things that they have never encountered before,” she adds.\nJust like us, dogs fear the unknown. According to Dr. Anna Kaufman, a veterinarian atBond Vet,this can include anything from new noises to fresh experiences previously unfamiliar to the pup. Sometimes this might be another animal and other times it’ll be a human invention they’ve yet to encounter. To be clear, none of that is to say more serious or damaging memories can’t have lasting effects as well. “If a dog experienced a trauma, this might cause fear reactions later on,”Dr. Kaufman confirms.\nEmotional distress aside, there are plenty of strange things that frighten dogs that are somewhat harmless. And for some of these, the true reason behind the fear isn’t always easy or even possible to pin down. As Dr. Kaufman puts it, “Every dog is unique, and that is why we love them.”\nSo, we gathered a few experts to see which fears might be as popular as they are peculiar.\nHow to keep your dog mentally and physically safe this New Year.\nThings that scare dogs\nAnyone who has tried the debilitating exercise that is cleaning your home with a canine bystander knows how many pups view vacuum cleaners. Whether it’s the unfamiliarity or volume of the noise vacuums produce, dogs view them as a sign of the end times.\n“[Dogs] can be afraid of common items that humans use daily, like the vacuum, but if they are unfamiliar with that item and the sounds they make, it can cause fear,” explains Michelle Bernstein, an animal behavior scientist atVCA Animal Hospitals. I can personally confirm that some pets are equally opposed to the next evolutionary step in vacuum cleaning: my dog hates my Roomba. To be fair, I do share her fears of AI and the impending robot apocalypse.\nI simplified it to planes, but this really extends to anything human-made and airborne, to be honest. As Leigh Siegfried, the founder and training director ofOpportunity Barks, explains, it all comes down to the sounds they make that can terrify dogs. Plus, they have a suspicious astonishment at the miracle of human flight.\n“Sometimes, they fear things like helicopters, planes, or hot air balloons, just any unanticipated objects in the sky that might be noisy or making noise,” Siegfried says. Luckily, theopportunities to flywith your dog are growing by the day so hopefully that will help them become morecomfortable with the concept.\nThis one’s slightly more serious and might reflect larger issues that should be handled with guidance from a professional. If ignored, these anxieties will only deepen and snowball into real behavioral concerns. Not to mention, Bernstein notes that this dread can often be coupled with — somewhat ironically — fears of solitude, which will really complicate your pup’s social life. “Dog can be afraid of strangers and being alone which can develop into behavior issues like separation anxiety and aggression,” she says.\nSome dogs are particularly afraid of men. While it’s usually due to previous trauma or a lack of socialization, I do understand the hesitation. As someone who has unfortunately dabbled with dating apps, I can confirm the men on those things are absolutely insane. So, I do get why other species would grow weary of the human male gender.\nPet parents know that not every pup likes to — or can — swim. It’s only natural some would have adverse feelings toward taking a dip or seeing water in general, especially when you consider how most react during the bathing process.\nBut Dr. Kaufman notes that, for some dogs, it’s the things that have seemingly conquered the water that are the scariest to them. “Some dogs don’t like water, some dogs are frightened by balloons or things that float,” she says.\nYou’d think the canine population would unanimously support a toy with which they have long been associated, but this is why it’s important not to stereotype. Sure, no one is suggesting that dogs are routinely terrified of tennis balls or any other round device they can fit in their mouths.\nBut if pups aren’t used to balls being big and bouncy, it can freak them out. “Some dogs are scared of any noise such as a basketball bouncing near them — all depends on the dog,” Dr. Kaufman says.\nResearch finds why dogs may suddenly become super sensitive to sounds.\nHow to handle quirky fears\nStrange as some of these may appear, it’s important to understand that any dog battling one of these fears is enduring real emotional distress. That terror is genuine, no matter how silly the item that’s inspiring it. As a result, pet parents should respond appropriately with care, even if they’re laughing a little through it.\nAccording to Siegfried, your first step when faced with a petrified dog should not be avoidance as appealing as it may seem. “If they have a big reaction to something, don’t let them run away. I know that sounds counterintuitive. But keeping the dog with you, helping them recover, and then moving away together builds resilience to recover,” she explains.\nHowever, that does not mean forcing your dog to do something they’re fearful of. This is not only cruel but will likely make the issue worse. Instead, pet parents should learn how to properly comfort their dogs. Siegfried explains that this often comes down to reassurance, calming your pup and letting them know everything is going to be fine. “It’s like a kid who fell off the monkey bars at a playground and is upset and could benefit from a pickup and a hug,” she says.\nThis summer, your pup deserves a little support.\nWhat you can do to ease their stress\nRhoades adds that you might have heard the advice that comforting a scared dog will eventually make the anxiety worse. She advises you to ignore this particular counsel; it’s entirely inaccurate. The fact that your pet is looking to you at these times is realistically a great indication of your overall bond.\n“What is happening is your dog is feeling comfortable enough to show their distress, so although it may feel that they are getting worse they are actually trusting you to support them,” she says.\nNow, there are a few methods to help pups better face their fears. Dr. Kaufman recommends investing in products like thunder shirts or calming collars for longer periods of exposure, as well as talking to your vet aboutcalming medicationsthat can be given prior to stressful events.\nBernstein also advocates for creating a safe space, a place in the home your pup can retreat to where they’ll always feel protected. Then, if necessary, you can slowly introduce them to what they’re afraid of while they feel secure. “Providing them with a safe space to explore and learn about something fearful will help your dog gain trust in you that the fearful thing might be safe, too,” she says. “You want your dog to trust you so they can learn to trust the thing they fear.”\nOf course, sometimes what seems like a silly little fear can also be a serious one. Rhoades warns that if your dog is struggling with day-to-day activities, losing sleep, or not eating, they may have a larger issue. Basically, if their behavior has worsened in an area unrelated to the direct fear, you should consider reaching out to a vet or trainer for help.",

  "page_content": "We humans are naturally anxious creatures. It’s the reason why people might avoid social gatherings, overthink past actions, or enjoy Phoebe Bridgers' music. I am personally burdened by a rotating set of fear-induced daily queries like,Is my dog truly happy?,Am I giving her enough exercise?, andHow can I ensure she outlives me?\nSure, there are concerns beyond pet parenthood, but they’re far less crippling. And come bedtime, these feelings only intensify. It’s been somewhat reassuring, then, to discover that dogs are also kept up at night by their worried little minds. In fact, they might also stress to the extent that it impacts their quality of sleep, which actually makes me more anxious now that I think about it. Unconditional love is exhausting.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nCo-sleeping with your pet has both positive and negative effects.\nDogs have nighttime panic, too.\nThis equally fascinating and upsetting discovery stems from the findings of a2017 studyconducted by Hungarian researchers. A team with the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest examined the relationship between emotional state and sleep patterns in dogs.\nThey recruited 16 pups and presented them with either a positive or negative experience before sleep. Nine of the participants were male while seven were female across varying breeds. Each dog was tested twice throughout the process.\nTo emulate a positive experience, dogs were treated togames of fetch or tug, as well as lots of pets. The negative experiences, however, involved being left alone in a room, ignored entirely by those present, or offered threatening body language by a stranger.\nSo, you can add the treatment of research animals in Hungary to my extensive list of anxieties. After exposure to one of these events, the dogs were taken to a room that they were previously made familiar with for a well-earned nap of up to three hours. At this point in the study, researchers attached noninvasive (thankfully) electrodes to the pups to monitor their brain activity as they slept.\nDogs: They’re not just like us.\nThe deeper the trauma, the shallower the sleep.\nOn average, the researchers found that following negative experiences dogs spent 20 minutes less in deep sleep. It makes sense: Most people can struggle with sleep after a stressful day. Not to mention, if, one day, everyone I encountered either ignored me or tried to intimidate me, I’d be pretty spooked too. And the professionals seem to agree.\n“There are times when dog owners report that their furry friend seems restless at night after something stressful, like a vet visit. But after a fun day of playing fetch or getting lots of cuddles, they sleep soundly and seem more relaxed,” says Iram Gladan, a PhD researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands and veterinarian withBreed Atlas.\nShe notes other stressors that might impact sleep include loud noises, unfamiliar environments, or negative interactions with other animals before calling out the species’ long-time nemesis. “Fireworks areknown to be a major problemfor all pets, especially dogs.\" Afterevents like Fourth of July, she says she has noticed that many dogs sleep poorly due to the loud fireworks and other loud stressors.\nSusan Nilson, trainer and founder ofThe Cat and Dog House, explains that emotions, like fear, anxiety, stress, or even frustration can all play a role in how pups sleep by activating a fight-or-flight response. This results in increased heart rate, blood flow to muscles, and a release of adrenaline that can mess with the animal at a chemical level.\nA lot of these emotions stem from the dog feeling unsafe, so Nilson offers a simple solution most effective if rolled out early. “That’s why I always recommend that dog owners who have just adopted a dog start by creating a safe space where the dog can retreat at will to decompress, regroup, and start to relax as he learns that he is safe in this new, unfamiliar environment with new, unfamiliar people,” she says.\nThere are pros and cons of sleeping with your dog — for both of you.\nNegative experiences kickstart (restless) slumber.\nThat being said, one of the study’s unexpected discoveries was that dogs who had just endured a negative experience fell asleep faster than those following a positive one. Despite their overall quality of sleep being diminished, negative experiences appeared to wipe the animals out. Beyond that, this was also followed by roughly 10 percent longer periods of sleep. Although, again, they spent less time in deep, restful sleep, which isn’t great.\nThe study implies that dogs may use sleep as a protective strategy against concerns of the day, kind of like how I avoid therapy sessions with long naps. Nilson confirms that sleeping can be a coping mechanism for worried pups, but it’s only one of several displacement behaviors they often exhibit.\n“So, you might see a dog engage in excess sniffing, drinking, or yes, sleeping, as a way of trying to reduce stress or tension arising from conflicting emotions or to provide an escape from an unpleasant or aversive situation,” she explains.\nGladan adds that this habit could also be a simple reaction to the exhaustion that follows high-stress situations, like someone crashing on the couch after putting in extra hours at the office. “This is similar to how humans might feel the need to nap after a particularly draining day,” she says.\nAnd just like us, dogs need quality sleep to properly support their physical and mental health. “During sleep, a dog’s body repairs and regenerates tissues, supports immune function, and processes the day’s experiences, which is vital for learning and memory,” she adds.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nPlay and attention help them get a quality snooze later.\nClearly, our pups need plenty of quality sleep to function. Quite a bit of it, in fact. Per Gladan, dogs need at least 12 to 14 hours of sleep each day. Depending on their age, however, they might need evenmore. For example, young puppies will require more zs to support their growth in the same way older pooches need more to aid their aging bodies. A fact that this 30-something finds all too familiar.\nAs the study showed, physical exercise is one of the best ways to enhance our pets’ sleep. Nilson confirms as much, noting that play is a great counter to negative emotions, particularly fear, and is a useful resource to help switch dogs from a negative emotional state to a positive one.\nAt the same time, mental stimulation can be used to attack sleep killing anxieties at the source. “Activities like sniffing, licking, and chewing are known stress busters in dogs so they can help dogs feel more relaxed and potentially improve sleep quality,” she explains.\nGladan also emphasizes the importance of exercise, both physical and mental, when trying to boost a dog’s sleep. But, like anyone with an AI girlfriend can tell you, nothing compares to the comfort of genuine love. “Of course, spending quality time with their owners helps them feel loved and secure, reducing anxiety and promoting relaxation,” she adds.\nDogs need more sleep than humans. Here’s how much is healthy.\nIs your dog stressing out before passing out?\nNow, I’d assume most people don’t have electrode devices at the ready to document the quality of their pet’s sleep. The best we can do is keep an eye out during the day for signs that our pupsmight be experiencing stressthat could potentially carry over into their dreamscapes.\nNilson recommends looking for changes in posture and expression, specifically with the eyes, ears, mouth, tail, and fur. These subtle cues can include sweaty paws, yawning when not tired,panting when not hot, excessive shedding, pacing, avoiding eye contact, widening of the tongue aka spatulate tongue, or whale eye which occurs when the whites of their eyes are showing.\nGladan points to otherphysical signslike a tucked tail, flattened ears, or tense posture as indications your dog is stressed. Destructive behaviors,like chewing furniture, might also suggest anxiety, as well as increased vocalization like barking or whining more than usual.\nUnfortunately, these actions can create a bit of a vicious cycle: Gladan warns that quality sleep is crucial to regulating a dog’s mood and reducing their stress levels. Over time, these issues will only cause them to be more anxious or irritable if ignored. New behavioral problems, a weakened immune system, and possibly shortened life are also risks of consistently limited sleep quality.\nSo, it’s imperative to keep your pup happy, healthy, and happily sleeping. As Gladan puts it, “After all, a dog that sleeps well wags well.”",

  "page_content": "Whether you are considering a new pal or are already devoted to a dog bestie, looking at your pup’s zodiac can be an illuminating and entertaining endeavor.  While all signs can come together in mutually fulfilling relationships, some astrological alignments can be more naturally compatible. Let’s explore some potential considerations between you and your canine counterpart.\nBelow, find your Sun sign and see which sign dog you are the most compatible with — as well as a few other signs ruled by compatible planets who could also be great cosmic matches for you.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nOr the diva cat energy. Either applies this month.\nAries (March 21 - April 19)\nBoth ruled by Mars, the planet of action, aggression, and vitality, you and your Scorpio hound share the competitive spirit of a friendly fight that can get serious, which fuels an ongoing battle to determine who has the real power in the relationship. Having found an equal opponent, there’s no doubt this relationship is built on love and respect, but this does not guarantee a peaceful accord — nor is that necessarily what either of you wants.\nYou likely take the prickly exterior of your Scorpio companion in your stride, and your natural humor and a tendency to get over things quickly may thwart your dog’s objective of maintaining a grudge for weeks. Sharing a similar intuition that the truest experience of being alive is found somewhere between excitement and terror, it follows that adrenaline-fueled physical activity, sparring, or chasing each other through the woods at night may be an important aspect of your bonding.\nSpontaneity and the thrill of the new are vitalizing forces for an Aries, whereas Scorpio canines can be suspicious of the unknown, territorial, and take a long time to trust others. More suited to a one-animal household, your incompatibility may be emphasized if you have a busy home with many visitors or want the kind of companion you can take everywhere.\nLacking the same level of energetic sensitivity as your dog, you may lack patience for their specific, inflexible needs, and emotional nature.\nSure, they may be your “pet,” but these fire-sign pooches operate with a self-determination that does not lend itself to docile domesticity. Like you, these strong-willed dogs don’t want to be cooped up inside all day, nor do they care for routine. What they do care for is Frisbee, playful rabble-rousing, and a tinge of recklessness — all of which you can likely get behind.\nTaurus (April 20 - May 20)\nAs a Taurus, your elevated domestic standards and a down-to-earth connection to nature makes for a peaceful union, forged in the comfort of fine fabrics, food, and a garden plot or grassy knoll to frolic on. Both creatures of ritual, this canine may expect to be fed, walked, and groomed at the same time every day, and you are likely to be rebuked for any divergence from this routine.\nSharply intelligent and conversational, Virgo dogs are politely vocal about what they do and do not like, so much so that you may find the rhythms of your home life shifting to account for their specific tastes and standards. Committed to the preservation of peace in your household, and serious about their role as a rule-abiding and polite member of the family, the Virgo dog will occasionally break character with bouts of zany hyperactivity when they’re really comfortable with you. While they may have less tolerance for children, they are reported to have an affinity with cats and are one of the most adaptable signs of the zodiac.\nHighly self-possessed, a Virgo may be less cuddly and more judgy that you would prefer, particularly about perceived laziness and cleanliness. Because Virgo is productivity-oriented and mentally active, dogs without a clear purpose and engagement may tend toward restlessness and struggle to take that chill pill you so love. This could possibly disrupt your leisurely domestic pace.\nWhile fellow earth sign Capricorn may share your work hard, play hard philosophy, Cancer and Libra natives will delight in the spoils of your efforts and your high thread count sheets.\nWhether you fall on the driven or cozy side of the equation at home, Cancer and Capricorn companions will take solace in your consistency and offer the same steadfast loyalty and love in return. Sharing your ruling planet, Venus, a Libran canine will possess a mutual dedication to beauty, artisanal treats, and self-care routines.\nGemini (May 21 - June 20)\nNot entirely certain about their identity as a dog, the peculiarities of this canine may offer you an endless wellspring of delight and curiosity. Sharing a mentally active air-sign intelligence, you genuinely enjoy each other’s company and conceptual frameworks and may even be quite verbally conversational. While neither of you require a high level of affection from one another, what you both require is social stimulation, and your Aquarian pet is likely to be an enthusiastic participant at any gathering.\nA dog of the people, thanks to their fondness for off-leash roaming, this pooch may get more recognition than you on your neighborhood strolls. Known for a fondness for cats and other animals, this is a dog that loves to be part of a busy household and will strike up friendships with the same egalitarian approach that characterizes their friendly yet somewhat impersonal relationship with you.\nAquarius is a fixed sign that is known for its steadfastness. Your flexible nature may be no match for your pup’s extremely stubborn streak and indifference to authority, compounded by the fact that they are smart for their own good. The truth is, almost everything this dog does will be entirely on their own terms, and you will have to work around that.\nCraving as much stimulation and variety as you — and possibly more attention — these gregarious fire signs are the type you can take into any situation and know it will be a good time. While both may have a lot of physical energy to expend, their extroverted natures mean they make friends easily and are more than happy to head off with whoever wants to play.\nLibras are the undisputed favorite humans at the dog park.\nCancer (June 21 - July 22)\nIs this your emotional support dog, or areyou their emotional support human? You and your pet share a need for deep bonding of the soul-centered variety. Highly attuned to the ebb and flow of each other's (many) moods, this type of connection requires no less than the intimacy of knowing each other’s heartbeats, past life experiences, and big spoon-little, spoon-preferences.\nYou will naturally want to bathe, swim, and take part in any water-based activities  together. Your nurturing instinct and hermit crab tendencies will soothe your dog’s more anxious and sensitive side; sometimes, this Piscean pup doesn’t know whether they want to go out, come in, be on your lap, or gaze off into the ether of some other world. A gentle, intuitive type, this dog will always know when you need comfort and when to expect visitors ten minutes before they arrive.\nThese sensitive souls can be overwhelmed by life in the material world, which may lead to dependency orseparation anxietywhen you’re not around. Without enough grounding or structure, your shared empathic qualities could also create a feedback loop of emotional stress.\nIntensely loyal, once these fixed signs have bonded with you, they will remain attached for life. While a snuggly Taurus dog will share your nap-oriented and snack-focused outlook, a Scorpio may be one of the only dogs who will stand in the rain, gazing out at the wild sea, with the level of raw feeling the occasion demands.\nLeo (July 23 - August 22)\nThe celebrity coupling of the zodiac, this dogknowsthey are good-looking, will always look at the camera when you take a photo, and has a license to showboat and is not afraid to use it. You have the standards that meet the elevated tastes of the Libran hound, who will behave more like a human BFF than a canine one and will certainly not go outside to pee in the rain.\nExtremely social, their genteel manner and desire to please make them a delightful companion to take almost anywhere. Provided these dogs have their own peaceful space to retreat to, they tend to be amiable household members and welcoming hosts to humans and animals alike. An enthusiastic participant in any pampering activities, if a Libra’s graceful demeanor wavers, it can be easily restored with some good old-fashioned bribery involving treats and gifts.\nWhile close relationships are essential to this canine’s happiness, you may detect a certain air-sign aloofness that falls short of the warmth and affirmation you need. A harmonious environment is also essential to a Libra, who may become stressed by some of your more boisterous and dramatic qualities as a Leo.\nSharing your playfulness and charisma, both signs need a similar quota of fun as you do to make it through the day. These dogs tend to love being petted by strangers as much as you love to make an impression — though as some of the most verbal and self-expressive signs, it’s likely the two of you will be heard long before you are seen.\nYour dog’s mature and serious countenance, likely since birth, conceals the sardonic wit you both delight in. With one knowing, wordless glance, this dog can communicate its approval or disdain for a new person, situation, or playmate. And yes, they do know that Prada is fake.\nSimilarly, a Capricorn canine will recognize and respect your diligent approach to their care. Sharing a conscientious approach to The Work and a love of routine, you and your Capricorn dog have found in each other a steadfast and detail-oriented companion with whom you can traverse those elusive peaks of perfection. Approaching the role of  “pet” with gravitas, this is a polite and obedient pup who loves praise, rewards, and maintaining stringent levels of home security.\nWhile your systems ensure seamless operations, sometimes y’all may need to let loose. Saturn-ruled Capricorn can tend toward melancholy or bouts of cold and distant behavior. A bit of spontaneity every now and then may help draw your dog out of an overly cautious mindset and allow their freak flag to fly high — given the opportunity, Capricorns can also get pretty serious about having a good time.\nSharing your earthy nature, a Taurus dog will value your devotion and reliability, reciprocating with unwavering loyalty and a calming, cuddly presence. On the other hand, a Pisces pooch will be more concerned with the needs of your soul, offering an affectionate, emotionally attuned companionship that balances your practical style of nurturing.\nLibra (September 23 - October 22)\nIf you think you are ever leaving the house or going on a car ride alone again, your Gemini twin has some news for you. Extremely verbal, this dog will be your spirited and charming companion who will act like an angel in public and save the mischief and chaos for their nearest and dearest at home.\nSharing a similar social intelligence, it’s unlikely you will take offense at the more impersonal qualities of your Gemini pooch, who is inconsistent in their affections and more than happy to head off with a friend for a few days without a backward glance. Quick, both in movement and in mind, this dog is sharp enough to master an arsenal of tricks, mastermind impossible-seeming escapes, and may undermine your social butterfly status by somehow knowing more people, animals, and news from around the neighborhood than you do.\nWithout adequate stimulation, your peaceful home environment may be disrupted by restless barking and mayhem of a hyperactive Gemini dog. While both of you may avoid rigidity and structure, a lack of routine may bring out the more indecisive and nervous aspects of your personalities.\nAligned in your love of beauty and insistence that the picture be taken until it is flattering, a Leo canine’s affection and diva antics will make for a lively connection. Less high- octane, fellow air sign Aquarius has a different type of rizz — social activities and mentally stimulating play are this dog's domain.\nThe dog who won’t leave your side or the cat who has a hit list full of your enemies is probably a Scorpio.\nScorpio (October 23 - November 21)\nRuled by the moon, governing the realms of feeling, dreams, and intuition, this dog may move from states of profound joy, despair, urgent hunger, and whatever your mood is — all before breakfast. Unfazed by emotional extremes and the nocturnal realms, you likely hold space for this process as it does for yours.\nSharing an instinctual bond that borders on the psychic, this may be the one living creature that truly does know all your secrets. The home is this dog’s domain and provided you do not become overwhelmed with their attachment to you or want a companion to explore the big wide world with, you will have an incredibly loving companion for life. Like the mother who lifts a car to save her child, their sleepy or shy exterior hides a fiercely protective warrior who will lay their life on the line to protect you and others it loves — nor would you expect anything less.\nCancer canines may be the most affected by their home environment and the stress of being left alone. This can be the differentiating factor between a loving and empathic companion and a clingy or fearful one. These dogs may fare better as members of a home-loving family; a single pet parent may struggle to fulfill these needs.\nIf any signs are as brave in the dark or as ready to go as far as you — for loveorhate—it is a Capricorn or Aries, except the Aries will likely lose sight of the objective at the first sign of anything they can chase.\nWhile a fellow Scorpio may be the only sign to match your depth of perception and passion, a Pisces shares your sensitivity to the ethereal world of vibes and always knows whenyou need a hug.\nSagittarius (November 22 - December 21)\nMagnanimous and playful qualities loom large in Leo dogs, who possess the kind of big-hearted bravery and flair for the dramatic that will send them into burning buildings to rescue those in their care. A generally sunny disposition and zest for life unites you as a fun-loving, charismatic duo, endearing you to all ages and species.\nRadiating affection, this canine will wake you up with a beaming face and the odd “gift” that was likely pilfered from your neighbor’s yard. A mutual penchant for holding court and mischievously engaging others make this pairing one of the most likely to have those days that starts with a stroll to the dog park and ends in a different state, the two of you having spontaneously agreed to help renovate an aging poet’s farmhouse. All in a day’s work for this whimsical pair.\nLarge and in charge, a battle of wills may ensue if you challenge this fixed-sign hound’s assumption that they are the ones calling the shots. Leo dogs tend to crave attention and can be a little relentless in pursuing it or are over-sensitive to perceived slights if they feel ignored.\nSharing your free-spirited nature and disinterest in conventionality or routine, canines of both these signs will gladly seek out new horizons alongside you. While an Aquarian's eccentric approach to life and social savvy keeps things interesting, the boundless enthusiasm of an Aries—and the mutual need to stretch your legs—means there is at least some chance that one of you will eventually tire the other out.\nAstrologer David Odyssey looks to Fiona Apple and Freddie Mercury to divine what Virgo season reveals about your dearest pet relationships.\nCapricorn (December 22 - January 19)\nAdmittedly, many things can go wrong with this combination of the horn and the hoof. If you’re a vigorous, sporting Capricorn with your sights set on the literal top of the mountain, you have in Aries a fearless sidekick who also approaches challenges with gusto. Their tremendous energy and playfulness may force you to abandon the most effective course for the most adventurous and accept your companion as an exasperating but entertaining force in your life.\nWhile these dogs reactive will always be a little wild at heart, you possess the patience and fortitude to carry out the kind of training that may make a significant difference between an excitable dog andone who is written offas having behavioral problems. This structure and commitment will foster a bond that deepens and improves with time.\nThe sheer excess of physical energy that some Aries dogs have to expend daily may be unmanageable without the appropriate level of space and input from others. Left inside all day, these dogs  have the potential to be loud and prolific barkers that may leave a trail of destruction and disruption in their wake. And that’s fair; theyneedtheir exercise. You just need to have the energy to give them what they need.\nYour fellow earth signs share your appreciation for stability, respect, and the finer things in life. Highly intelligent and receptive to training, a Virgo will be an industrious member of the household. A Taurus, however, may rival your ability to hold a grudge and set a pace that is so slow on walks that you are, in fact, forced to stop and smell the roses.\nAquarius (January 20 - February 18)\nFounded on mutual respect for one another’s quest for meaning and mutual needs for a broad range of experience and information, a Saggitarian pooch will be your cheerful companion on this thrilling voyage called life. Whether this takes the form of an amble to the coffee shop or an intrepid journey further afoot (these dogslove the carand can walk forever), nothing can stop this tail from wagging, and all will be met with an enthusiastic  “yes.”\nPossessing a friendliness and independence that rivals your own, Sagittarians are dogs of the people, and the extent of their fondness for adventure become apparent by just how many members of the animal and human community stop to specifically address them on your walks. Both non-conformists at heart, your dynamic is a magnet for unexpected situations, silliness, and unconventional connections that satisfy your inquisitive minds and adventurous souls.\nSymbolized by the centaur, Sagittarians take the half-horse part quite literally, meaning the call of the great outdoors is strong for these dogs. Their need to roam may be challenging to fulfill without an appropriate amount of space and fellow roughhousing companions.\nLoud, bumbling, and a little accident-prone, these pups may not be suitable for a house-proud pet parent or apartment dweller, particularly if their excitement is bottled up for too long and explodes.\nYour air sign compadres have a similar love of social stimulation, discourse, and learning new things that foster highly communicative companionships. Whether you welcome a little divine chaos of the capricious Gemini variety or take to the benign (if occasionally a tad haughty) influence of the Libran, both are adaptable and intelligent, sharing your curiosity in connecting with a wide range of humans and animals alike.\nWhere they lead, we will follow.\nPisces (February 19 - March 20)\nAffectionate, gentle, and happy to stroll at the slowest pace through life (ideally, a drive through the countryside with the window down), a Taurus canine’s love of human companionship makes this a comforting and close-knit connection. Presented with regular meals, a soft blanket, and a thorough pat, their profound contentment and serene repose offer a grounding respite from the chaos of the world.\nKnown to love music, children, and most of all, the familiar, once a Taurus has a cozy spot, they prefer to return to it for the rest of their lives. Lazy souls by nature, they are surprisingly quick to temper if their food source, Tempurpedic dog bed, or other items taken into their possession are threatened — this includes you. Your Taurus dog will be a staunch and loyal protector of anyone they have bonded deeply with.\nOf all signs, Taurus canines are set in their ways. As they do not share your fluidity, your tendency to align with the energy rather than the hands of the clock may not go down well with the stubborn bull who likes routine and may resist adapting to new environments or schedules.\nRegardless of the pup who ends up becoming a part of your family, you can find compatible qualities in them. What it comes down to is that you love each other and are each other’s ride or dies. After all, your pup probably isn’t going to sit still long enough to listen to you recite their whole chart to them. They have treats to eat and snuggles to give!\nThe water sign trinity gets it — Cancer and Scorpio dogs share your attunement to those fundamental building blocks of any relationship, for example, communicating in dreams on the astral plane.\nBoth fiercely protective and empathic, a Cancer pooch’s expertise lies in cuddle culture. On the other hand, a Scorpio brings a little intensity and a fondness for roaming the premises in the dead of night and barking at unseen intruders.",

  "page_content": "When my kids were young, it made them happy to hear me groan about a looming deadline. They knew from experience they would get to watch movies until the writing gods smiled on me enough to complete whatever I was working on.\nFor that reason, you’ll never hear any judgment from me about plopping kids in front of screens from time to time — you do what you have to do! That’s why I say, to those holier-than-thou parents out there criticizing screen time for kids, “I’m not interested in your thoughts on the matter, thanks.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nCriticism about screen time is just a part of parenting in the modern world, as is disagreement about how much is too much. If you’re interested in a social experiment, try yelling at a group of parents with any assertion about how much TV time is too much for kids and see all hell break loose while they all descend into unhinged arguments.\nNow, it looks like we might get to have the same debate and be shamed for our choices as pet parents — because aJanuary study revealsthat dogsalsolove spending time in front of that glowing monitor of endless entertainment.\nIsAnimal Planetreally their favorite channel?\nDogs love TV.\nIn the study, over 1,200 people filled out a survey about their dogs and their interest in a variety of activities, such as animals, ball sports, non-ball sports, and vehicles. These same people answered questions about their dogs’ reactions to four videos of movement going across a screen, of a dog, a bird, traffic, and a panther.\nDogs had a lot of different reactions to the videos, according to the surveys. It’s common for dogs to turn their head to the side and prick their ears, to vocalize, or to approach the screen. Over three-quarters of dogs in the study performed each of these behaviors. Over one-quarter of them looked behind the screen or around the side of it or touched the screen with their nose. Just a few (about one in 20) of the dogs brought a toy to the screen or ran away from the screen.\nAlmost half of the people who participated in the study play videos or leave the TV on for their dogs when they are home alone. Seventeen percent of the people play dog-specific content,like DogTV, for their dogs. There were nearly as many people who provided screen time for their dogs in their absence (48 percent) as those who providedinteractive toysfor their dogs (57 percent), which gives you some idea how popular the strategy is for entertaining dogs.\nYes, dogs can see muted colors.\nThey really love watching other dogs on the screen.\nJust like me when I couldn’t pull away from that long-awaitedTed Lassoseries finale, dogs get excited about what's on TV. They pay a lot of attention to screens, especially when animals are in the videos. Unsurprisingly, they are enchanted by dogs most of all. People who filled out the surveys reported that their pups loved the movement on the screen and aren’t as interested in the sound. In fact, a number of the people surveyed in the study reported that their dogs were just as interested in watching activity on screens when the sound was off as when it was on.\nLike kids, all dogs are susceptible to getting sucked into movies, videos, and social media, but some may be a bit more than others. Young dogs are more likely to be into watching screens than older dogs. Herding and sporting breeds are most likely to be into screens compared with other groups of dogs. Dogs with good vision were more interested in their screens as well.\nIt’s not all black and white.\nIs too much screen time a bad thing for dogs?\nScreens can entertain dogs, but it should not get in the way of their other needs, such as being outside, getting lots of exercise, playing, being social, and training time. So, while there’s not a firm rule about how much screen time is too much, it should only be a supplement to making their days interesting. It should not be the main way to stimulate your dog’s brain but is just an additional tool for making their life interesting.\nTV can help keep dogs occupied when they are alone, but it’s not going to be effective at treating separation anxiety. And, it’s not going to be stimulating enough to get you off the hook for walks, play time, and teaching them new skills. They need time to be outside and active, with the amount of exercise depending on their age and activity level — so make sure screen time is not cutting into those activities. Too much screen time is bad for dogs if it’s taking away from other quality activities — theyreally are like little kids. Looks like screen-time rules should be implemented for thewholefamily now.\nReferences:\nScreen Interaction Behavior in Companion Dogs: Results From a Dog Owner Survey",

  "page_content": "Think of your dog’s behavior like you do grammar rules. Just as the words “there,” “they’re,” and “their” sound the same but mean different things (and definitely should not be used interchangeably), your dog’s body language and communication is complex.\nFor example, whendogs growl,it isnotalways a sign of aggression; they may do so to ask something scary to back off, or they may do so while they’re having fun. Dogs pull when they are on the leash to get to a happy place as quickly as possible, or they pull to get away from a threat. They chew shoes, pillows, and toys because — well, they’re dogs. Or they chew a doorframe because they’ve been left home alone and are panicking.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhen your dog growls, they’re expressing their emotions. A study found that you’ll likely be able to understand what they’re feeling.\nIn order to teach your dogs to do things such as walk politely rather than pull or chew an approved toy rather than a doorframe, you need to understand what your pet is trying to communicate and their emotional state. When fear and anxiety are at the root of the problem and you help your pup overcome them, the “bad” behavior goes away. Being able to tell how a dog is feeling can be challenging, so here are a few tips to get clued into what your dog’s body language is trying to tell you.\nAre they taking an aggressive stance?\nLet’s focus on what is probably the most inaccurately used adjective when it comes to describing dog behavior: “aggressive.” I’ve heard people use it when referring to a 10-week-old puppy who was playfully nipping the feet and legs of the children in the family. Most often, I hear people use it to describea barking dog. “How do you know he’s barking aggressively?,” I always ask. And the typical reply is, “Because he was barking.” Imagine if every time you spoke, someone assumed you were thinking about attacking them!\nLet’s clear up the disconnect right now between what dogs do when they’re displaying signs of aggression and what they do when they’re just being dogs.\nNo longer associate feeding time with growling time.\nSigns of Aggressive Dog Body Language\nDog communication is mostly nonverbal; they “talk” with their bodies. Here are a few dog body language signals that could possibly indicate aggressive intent (if you observe any of the following, give the dog some space, at the very least):\nForward-leaning stance\nForward-leaning stance\nStiff body\nStiff body\nTail above the horizon, possibly stiff, possibly wagging\nTail above the horizon, possibly stiff, possibly wagging\nEars up and forward (for cropped ears, look at the base of the ear)\nEars up and forward (for cropped ears, look at the base of the ear)\nWrinkles or ridges around the eyes and lips\nWrinkles or ridges around the eyes and lips\nDirect stare\nDirect stare\nRaised hackles (hair along the dog’s back)\nRaised hackles (hair along the dog’s back)\nAs you can see, when a dog is threatening aggression, his body tends to be stiff and forward. He may also bare his teeth, growl, or bark. Let’s compare this to a dog who has friendly intentions. A comfortable dog has a relaxed body that appears curved or wiggly (think puppy), soft eyes, with their tail below the horizon, often loosely wagging, ears relaxed, and mouth gently open.\nSubtle Warning Signals\nDogs have powerful jaws and teeth that can do considerable harm to others, but it’s not in their best interest to go around biting people or other dogs. Fighting uses up a lot of energy, and they can be hurt or even killed as a result of engaging in it. So, rather than attack, dogs employ a vocabulary of escalating warning signals to ask the stressor to move away: hard stare, growl, bark, snarl, snap, and bite with inhibited force (meaning, they “pull their punch” and use reduced pressure).\nIf, after all of those warnings, the threat still has not moved away, a dog might then bite with full force. It’s important to note that dogs’ warning signals are very individual; some do all of them, some do a few, some bypass them altogether and go straight to the bite.\nTwo animal behavior experts agree it’s usuallyplay fighting. Here’s how you can tell.\nBut an often overlooked factor—which could lead to aggressive behavior if ignored—is stress. It’s extremely important to know when your dog is showing signs of stress so you can remove him from the situation or help them cope with it.\nSigns of Stressed Dog Body Language\nImagine you’re walking your dog in the park and a dog you’ve never met before approaches (we’ll assume both dogs are on leash). Don’t take it as a given that your dog will want to meet the other dog. Observe the dog’s body language to determine how they’re feeling about the situation.\nPreviously open mouth suddenly closes\nPreviously open mouth suddenly closes\nEars go back\nEars go back\n“Dandruff” or dander appears\n“Dandruff” or dander appears\nTail risesabove the horizon\nTail risesabove the horizon\nYawning begins\nYawning begins\nTongue flicks as if licking their lips\nTongue flicks as if licking their lips\nTurns entirely away from the approaching dog (or averts just eyes or head)\nTurns entirely away from the approaching dog (or averts just eyes or head)\nStarts scratching or sniffing\nStarts scratching or sniffing\nLili Chin’s bookDoggie Languageillustrates how dogs communicate — beyond ear perks and tail wags.\nIf your dog displays any of these behaviors, err on the side of caution. Respect what they’re telling you, which is, “I need some space!” Move your dog out of the path of the oncoming dog and let them observe the strange dog at a stress-free distance. How will you know how far that is? Again, observe your dog and their body language will tell you. The stress behaviors will disappear, and you’ll see a noticeable softening or relaxing of their face and body.\nOne more important point to remember: Like human behavior, dog behaviors are fluid and can change in a blink of an eye. So when your dog is in a new situation, pay attention to what they are trying to tell you with their body language. With careful observation of dog body language, you can learn to “speak dog” and keep your pet safe and happy.",

  "page_content": "Have you ever been startled awake by your dog’s loud snoring? Like, so loud that it sounds like a human being is snoozing away? While it may be amusing at first, it’s important to understand the reasons behind this noisy habit.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nIs It normal for dogs to snore?\nIt’s normal for some dogs to snore occasionally. Some dog parents are comforted by the sounds of their pup’s snoring. Others are not so amused and wonder,Why does my dog snore so loud I can’t sleep?\nNormal snoring is typically consistent and not accompanied by other symptoms. However, abnormal snoring may have a sudden onset or be accompanied by signs like labored breathing, nasal discharge, or exercise intolerance.\nDon’t panic: It’s called reverse sneezing, and in most cases, it’s nothing to worry about.\nCommon causes of dog snoring\nSome dogs are more likely to snore than others. Some causes of snoring, like breed, can’t be controlled, while others, like obesity, can be managed. Does your dog snore loudly? One of these reasons may be why:\nBrachycephalic (flat-faced)dog breeds, such as French Bulldogs, English Bulldogs, Pugs, Boston Terriers, and Shih Tzus have airways that make them more prone to being noisy breathers.\nAny time air isn’t able to flow smoothly through the airways, there can be sounds, including stertorous snoring sounds. Theseshort-muzzled dogsare likely to have some degree of brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS), a condition that is characterized by physical traits including:\nNarrow nostrils: Narrow nostrils can get even narrower during inhalation, making air passage more difficult and leading dogs to breathe through their mouth.\nNarrow nostrils: Narrow nostrils can get even narrower during inhalation, making air passage more difficult and leading dogs to breathe through their mouth.\nElongated soft palate: The soft palate (the back of the roof of the mouth) can be so long that it starts to cover the airway and partially blocks passage of air into the lungs. This causes snoring due to vibrations as air passes by this partially blocked airway.\nElongated soft palate: The soft palate (the back of the roof of the mouth) can be so long that it starts to cover the airway and partially blocks passage of air into the lungs. This causes snoring due to vibrations as air passes by this partially blocked airway.\nEverted laryngeal saccules: This tissue near the vocal cords is pulled inward during inhalation, which can partially block the airway and lead to snoring.\nEverted laryngeal saccules: This tissue near the vocal cords is pulled inward during inhalation, which can partially block the airway and lead to snoring.\nLarge tongue: A large, thick tongue will take up more space in the mouth and start to occupy space in the throat, further obstructing air flow.\nLarge tongue: A large, thick tongue will take up more space in the mouth and start to occupy space in the throat, further obstructing air flow.\nNarrow trachea: A narrow trachea (windpipe) means that a lot of air is trying to pass through a smaller than normal tube, causing more high-pitched sounds.\nNarrow trachea: A narrow trachea (windpipe) means that a lot of air is trying to pass through a smaller than normal tube, causing more high-pitched sounds.\nObese dogs aremore likely to snoredue to the excess fat surrounding their airway tissues. Dogs that are both obese and brachycephalic have a high risk of developing breathing issues far beyond snoring. They are more prone toheat strokeand are risky patients when it comes to anesthetic procedures.\nLike people, dogs can snore in certain positions and be silent sleepers in others. Any body position that contributes to restricted air flow, like sleeping on their back, can make a dog snore.\nRespiratory infections, whether viral or bacterial, can cause airway inflammation and excess mucus production. Allergies commonly cause itchiness in dogs, but some dogs experience sneezing and inflamed airways. The inflammation and extra boogers can make breathing more difficult, leading to snoring.\nLaryngeal paralysis is a condition in which the nerves that control the vocal cords become weakened or paralyzed, leading to an airway that doesn’t fully open when a dog breathes in. Dogs with laryngeal paralysis often make loud, raspy sounds when they breathe and have hoarse, whispery barks. The condition can also make them more likely to snore. Laryngeal paralysis is mostcommonly seen in olderlarge-breed dogs.\nForeign bodies or growths in any location in the airway can also obstruct air flow and cause noisy breathing and snoring. This can include benign nasal polyps, malignant tumors, or material in the nasal cavities or throat. Dogs with objects or growths in their airway may also exhibit sneezing,coughing, gagging, or nasal discharge.\nIt’s a personal preference, but here are the pros and cons.\nHow to stop your dog from snoring\nAnoccasional snore from your dogis no big deal. However, persistent loud snoring can disrupt your sleep and be a sign of an underlying issue. If a gentle nudge isn’t enough, here are some tips to minimize your dog's snoring:\nOverweight dogs are more likely to snore, so make sure your dog stays at an ideal body weight. Provide plenty of opportunities for exercise and play, feed a nutritious diet, and be mindful with snacks. If your dog continues to gain weight despite your best efforts, consult with your vet.\nTake steps to protect your pup from contagious respiratory infections. Keep your dog up to date on vaccines and preventative care. Stick to play dates with dogs who are also current on their shots and free of respiratory symptoms.\nDoggie airways can be irritated by dry air and allergen particles. Consider a humidifier orair purifierin the room where your dog sleeps.\nDogs are more prone to snoring when they sleep on their back than when they sleep on their side or stomach. To promotepeaceful sleep, provide a dog bed or pillow that encourages a position less likely to cause snoring.\nIf your dog’s snoring has gone from kind of cute to a total nightmare, talk to your veterinarian. It may be time to investigate possible underlying medical issues or adjust treatment of chronic issues like allergies. See your vet about your dog’s snoring if you notice the following:\nYour dog’s snoring is new\nYour dog’s snoring is new\nYour dog is “snoring” while awake\nYour dog is “snoring” while awake\nYour dog seems to have sleep apnea (they stop breathing while asleep)\nYour dog seems to have sleep apnea (they stop breathing while asleep)\nYour dog has a hard time breathing while awake\nYour dog has a hard time breathing while awake\nYour dog has additional respiratory symptoms like coughing or nasal discharge\nYour dog has additional respiratory symptoms like coughing or nasal discharge\nYour vet can use your dog’s medical history and physical exam findings to determine the level of concern. An airway exam may also be recommended to check deep in your dog’s throat. Sedation is usually required for your vet to be able to take a good look while your dog takes nice, deep breaths. Imaging like radiographs or rhinoscopy (looking at the nasal passages with a camera) can also be used to evaluate the airways.\nTreatment can vary depending on the factors contributing to the snoring, and can range from a weight-loss plan to medication for respiratory disease to surgery to help correct an obstructed brachycephalic airway.\nKeep your pup’s weight down, and you could add years to their life. What’s better than that?\nFAQs (People also ask):\nIt’s normal for some dogs to snore, especially brachycephalic (smoosh-faced) breeds like Pugs andEnglish Bulldogs.

Dogs have this uncanny ability to tune into our emotions, almost like they have a sixth sense for what’s going on in our heads and hearts. From wagging tails to cozy cuddles, they’ve got a whole repertoire of comforting moves up their furry sleeves. But how do they do it? Turns out, our canine companions aren’t just good listeners — they’re emotional experts, too.\nResearch showsthat dogs use a combination of visual and auditory cues to understand how someone is feeling, and they can decipher between positive and negative emotions. Essentially, they can pick up on our vibes, whether we’re feeling on top of the world or a bit down in the dumps. Let’s take a deep dive into the fascinating science of dog emotions and what you can expect from your caring companion when you’re in your feelings.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThe sentiment is nice, but...\nCan dogs sense when you’re sad?\nDogs use their keen senses to read our moods and emotions, including when we’re sad. They pick up on subtle cues in our body language and tone of voice, allowing them to detect when something’s amiss.\n“No one questions when a dog gets excited when we get excited,” says Robert Haussmann, Certified Trainer, Canine Behavior Consultant, and co-founder ofDogboy NYC. “If we’re sullen, sad, or crying, those are behaviors that are not unique to us. Depending on your bond and relationship with your dog and their age, they can sense a wide range of emotions.”\nIf you’re feeling upset and notice that your pup is acting differently, it’s because they can likely sense the shift in your mood. Our canine companions are constantly observing us and responding to our emotions, so whether you’re happy, sad, oranxious, any change in your emotional state may be reflected in your dog’s behavior.\nWhich comes first: a nervous person or a nervous pup?\nHow dogs respond to human emotions\nWhen we look into the science behind a dog’s response to our emotional state, we discover that humans and animals share similar emotional and neurologicalmirroring systems, which allow us to connect and understand one another. These mirror neurons in a dog’s brain fire both when they perform an action and when they observe a human performing the same action. This neurological system is linked to social behaviors like empathy and learning by imitation.\n“Dogs and humans have this unique evolutionary history,” Haussmann says. “Dogs came in when we stopped being nomads. We have co-evolved for a very long time, and it doesn’t surprise me that dogs will respond to your emotional state.”\nThe way your dog responds to you being sad can vary, but you may see some peculiar behavior, such as licking or avoidance.\nYou may notice when you’re sad your dog starts to lick you. Licking is often their way of offering comfort and support, similar to how they might comfort each other within their own pack. It’s their way of saying, “I’m here for you, and I want to make you feel better.” So, when your dog licks you while you’re sad, it’s their way of trying tocheer you upand show you some love.\nWhile some dogs lick their pet parents to provide comfort when they’re sad, others might react differently. Some dogs will sense our sadness and choose to give us space, as they may pick up on the fact that we’re feeling vulnerable or upset. In these cases, your dog might avoid you because they’re unsure of how to help or because they don’t want to exacerbate your emotions. To you, it might look like yourdog is sad, too, but they may just be trying to give you some alone time.\n“As long as it’s not having a negative effect on them, let your dog feel their feelings,” Haussmann says. “You can by all means comfort them while they’re comforting you.”\nWhether they’re licking or avoiding, it’s important to remember that each dog has a unique personality and will respond differently. Haussmann reiterates that humans can have a tendency to hijack their dog’s emotions, and it’s important to just let them be sometimes.\nAnd when you want to draw the line attoomany kisses.\nHow dogs comfort sad pet parents\nDogs just seem to have this knack for knowing when their humans need a little extra TLC. If you’re sad, here are some ways your dog may comfort you:\nCuddling up beside you\nCuddling up beside you\nLaying their head on your lap or chest\nLaying their head on your lap or chest\nLicking your hands or face gently\nLicking your hands or face gently\nOffering gentle nudges or leaning against you\nOffering gentle nudges or leaning against you\nBringing you their favorite toy or blanket\nBringing you their favorite toy or blanket\nStaying close by your side\nStaying close by your side\nOffering soothing, non-verbal sounds like sighs or soft whimpers\nOffering soothing, non-verbal sounds like sighs or soft whimpers\nGazing into your eyes with a look of understanding\nGazing into your eyes with a look of understanding\nResponding to your emotions with their own displays of affection, such as licking or putting a paw on you\nResponding to your emotions with their own displays of affection, such as licking or putting a paw on you\nWhether it's a wagging tail or a gentle paw on your lap, their presence alone can work wonders tolift your spiritsand make the world feel a bit brighter.\nThe canine-human bond\nThe bond between humans and dogs is one of the most cherished and studied relationships in the animal kingdom. Dogs have long been recognized for their remarkable ability to offer comfort and support to humans during times of distress, which has led many scientists to research the concept of empathy in dogs. Onestudyreveals that dogs display empathic-like behavior when they come across a human crying, but not when they encounter a talking or humming human. While this discovery emphasizes the captivating bond between humans and canines, there are also limitations, because it’s not possible for humans to fully comprehend dog emotions.\n“There’s a lot of innate magic between dogs and people,” Haussmann says. “I think we need to be careful to not put these concepts and how we’ve organized our emotions and feelings into words and language that dogs just don’t have. If we do, it can make us respond in certain ways if you feel like your dog should be empathizing with you. If you just accept that you’re sharing your house with this animal that has co-evolved with you, you can just enjoy them for who they are.”\nUltimately, whether your pup’s response to your sadness results in cuddling, licking, or giving you some space, know that they are trying their best to comfort you in their own way. There’s no doubt that we share a deep bond with our canine companions, and we can take solace in the fact that we’ve always got each other’s backs.\nCue the Phoebe Bridgers—your pup may just soak up your tears.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nYes, dogs are remarkably attuned to human emotions and can sense a wide range of feelings beyond just sadness. Dogs can sense fear, happiness, anxiety, and evenstressin their human companions. This ability is attributed to their keen observational skills, acute sense of smell, and their ability to pick up on subtle changes in body language and vocal cues.\nIf your dog appears distressed when you’re feeling sad, you can try to provide them with reassurance and comfort. Offer your dog affection, cuddles, and soothing words to help alleviate their distress. Creating a calm and nurturing environment can also help reassure your dog and alleviate any anxiety they may be experiencing.\nWhile all dogs possess some degree of emotional intelligence, not every dog is equally adept at sensing human emotions. Factors such as breed, individual temperament, and socialization experiences can influence a dog’s ability to interpret and respond to human emotions.\nCertain breeds are often favored as emotional support animals due to their calm demeanor, affectionate nature, and intuitive understanding of human emotions. However, the suitability of a dog as an emotional support animal ultimately depends on individual temperament, training, and the unique bond between the dog and their human companion.\nReferences:\nDogs Recognize Dog and Human Emotions\nDogs Recognize Dog and Human Emotions\nA Preliminary Work on Dog Emotion Recognition\nA Preliminary Work on Dog Emotion Recognition\nDogs Can Discriminate Emotional Expressions of Human Faces\nDogs Can Discriminate Emotional Expressions of Human Faces",

  "page_content": "Ever wonder why the moment you get home from a sweaty run and change your shoes is also the moment your dog decides to go to town on your feet? Same. While many of us pet parents take dog kisses as a compliment, when a dog licks your feet, it can feel sort of weird — and maybe even a little bit gross (but hey, we’re not judging if you low-key enjoy it). But why do our canine companions engage in this peculiar behavior?\nThere’s not one clear answer, but rather, many potential explanations. Let’s uncover why dogs lick your feet, what it means, and how you can stop it from happening in the future.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHow does that taste, bud?\nWhy do dogs lick human feet?\nLicking is a natural behavior in dogs, often associated with smell, affection, attention seeking, or taste. Your feet are rich in trapped odors and pheromones, so if you’ve been walking in sandals or are barefoot, there are scents that telegraph to your dog where you’ve been. And that leads us to our first reason why dogs lick feet: They’re engaging their sense of smell.\nA dog’ssense of smellis the most developed sense they have due to their unique anatomy. Dogs have roughly 300 million olfactory receptors in their noses, compared to only about six million in humans. The anatomy of a dog’s nose funnels about 12 percent of each breath going to the olfactory (smelling) region, and the rest to the lungs.\n“Both of these factors enhance the ability of dogs to detect current scents as well as a historical picture of who or what has been in the area in the past,” says Dr. Wendy Hauser, veterinarian and veterinary spokesperson forASPCA Pet Health Insurance. “Using smell in both ways helps the dog create a real time roadmap of threats and opportunities.”\nHauser explains that the odors that arise from a human’s foot are unique and may be used by the dog to identify a favorite human (congratulations, that’s you). Dogs are also amazing at recognizing different physiological states through their sense of smell, including the emotional state of a human, illnesses, and even the stages in a reproductive cycle. Simply put, licking your feet may mean your pup is just trying to figure out what you’ve been up to and how you’re feeling.\nWhen your dog licks your feet, they may also be trying tobond with you. In fact, feet-licking is a behavior seen in dog-to-dog interactions, too.\n“Dogs traditionally lick as a way of showing affection to other bonded dogs,” Hauser says. “It makes sense that the dog might extend this behavior to the human members of [their] pack. This can also be reinforced by the human’s behavior—if they laugh or enjoy it, the dog receives positive feedback.”\nThat’s right, if giggles and sweet talk follow when your dogs licks your feet, you’re pretty much telling them to keep going.\nDogs are known for their unique ways ofseeking attention, and licking your feet might just be one of them. This behavior could be their way of saying, \"Hey, pay attention to me!\" Dogs often lick as a form of communication, whether it's to show affection, seek reassurance, or simply to get your attention. So, the next time your canine companion starts licking your feet, it might just be their way of telling you they want your attention.\nThis may seem kind of gross, but your dog may just love the way your feet taste. After all, dogs are known for their keen sense of smell and taste, and they may find the saltiness or scent of your feet appealing.\nDogs explore the world around them through taste, so they might be curious to sample different scents and flavors, including those on your feet. While it can seem a bit strange to us, licking your feet could simply be your dog’s way of indulging (literally) in their natural instincts to explore and taste new things.\nThe sentiment is nice, but...\nWhat does it mean when dogs lick your feet?\nDogs licking your feet can convey various messages, and it’s often a multi-faceted behavior. As discussed, they might be using their acute sense of smell to gather information about your whereabouts or emotions.\nYour pup also might be trying to establish a connection with you, seek attention, or, in some cases, simply savor the taste of your feet. And while licking can communicate different intentions, it doesn’t always have a specific meaning and may vary from one dog to another. Ultimately, understanding your dog's behavior and context can provide insights into their motivations.\nTheir toes might smell like Fritos, but there’s no way they tastethatgood.\nIs it bad for your dog to lick your feet?\nWhile most of the time a dog licking your feet just means they’re curious about you or trying to bond, dogs may also lick when they are stressed or anxious. In this case, licking your feet could be a call for help. If you notice othersigns of anxiety, such as panting, pacing, or avoidance behaviors, it’s probably best to reach out to a veterinarian to see what’s going on. It’s also important to be aware of what’s actually on your feet.\n“If the human has any products on their feet, like anti-fungal or other medications, it could be harmful to the dog to ingest those products,” Hauser explains.\nDr. Hauser also advises that it could be harmful to humans if your dog licks open wounds, as this could lead to bacterial transfer from the mouth to the wound. At the end of the day, we don’t want this to become a chronic habit, because it’s probably not good for your dog to fixate on something and it’s probably not good for your feet to be constantly licked. Thankfully, there are lots of other ways to bond with your dog that don’t include your feet.\nAnd when you want to draw the line attoomany kisses.\nHow to stop your dog from licking your feet\nThere are a couple of ways to train a dog not to lick feet. The easiest fix is to just wear shoes, socks, or slippers — but if that’s not for you, try some of the following methods. Just make sure you’re consistent with all members of the family so you send the same message.\nOffering an alternative activity can effectively redirect your dog’s attention from licking your feet. Introduce a stimulating chew toy, such as a treat-filled Kong or a food puzzle ball. At the same time, gently move your feet away from your dog to reinforce the behavior of focusing on the toy rather than licking.\nOnce your dog moves away from your feet and does something else, you can give them praise and a treat to reward them. With consistent redirection and positive reinforcement, your dog can learn to associate the chew toy with a rewarding and appropriate activity, reducing the urge to lick your feet.\nCues such as “out” and “leave it” can be extremely helpful in situations where you don’t want your dog messing with something. Start by associating the cue with the desired action, using positive reinforcement techniques such as treats and praise to encourage compliance. With practice, your dog will learn to respond to these cues, allowing you to effectively communicate your expectations and manage their behavior in various situations, not just feet-licking ones.\nA bored dog will always get into things that might not be good for them—your feet included. Make sure you’re providing your dog with enough mental and physical stimulation. Engage them in regular play sessions,interactive toys, and brain games to keep their mind and body active and stimulated. It’s also important to make sure they get exercise through walks, runs, or playtime in the yard to help channel their energy in a positive way. And lastly, maybe it’s time to smell your own feet...\n“Pay attention to your foot hygiene,” Hauser says. “Why is your dog so interested? Maybe you need to wash your feet more often, use odor absorbing socks, or breathable shoes.”\nAt the end of the day, while your dog licking your feet is likely harmless, it could lead to unfortunate consequences for both of you. By understanding the reasons behind this behavior and implementing positive training techniques, you can foster a stronger bond with your pup while ensuring their well-being and preventing potential discomfort for yourself.\nTheir toes might smell like Fritos, but there’s no way they tastethatgood.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nDogs lick their pet parents for various reasons, often as a form of communication or affection. Licking can be a way for dogs to show submission, seek attention, or express their love and affection toward their human companions.\nDogs lick their feet for a variety of reasons, ranging from grooming and cleaning to addressing irritation or discomfort. Just like humans, dogs can experience itchiness or discomfort in their feet due to various factors such as allergies, injuries, or skin conditions. Licking their feet helps them to alleviate itching, clean their paws, or soothe any irritation they may be experiencing.\nYes, dogs often lick their pet parents as a way to show affection and love. Licking is a natural behavior in dogs, and they may lick their humans’ faces, hands, or other body parts as a gesture of love and closeness.\nReferences:\nCanine Olfaction: Physiology, Behavior, and Possibilities for Practical Applications\nCanine Olfaction: Physiology, Behavior, and Possibilities for Practical Applications",

  "page_content": "Once the weather is nice, and you’re spending time outside with your pup, everyone’s happy. Everyone (read: your dog) is also eating grass.Why?There are many theories as to why dogs eat grass, including instinctual behavior, dietary deficiency, or possibly digestive upset.\nMany of these theories are unproven and in most cases, eating grass can be a normal behavior for dogs. But whileoccasionalgrass eating is generally considered normal, persistent or excessive consumption may warrant a closer look at the dog's overall health.The truth is that no one knows for sure. There have been very few scientific studies designed to answer this question, so most of what we know is based on theories and observations. One of the main reasons we suspect dogs eat grass is because it is an innate behavior.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThis is based on observations that their wild ancestors, wolves, also eat grass routinely. It may be a way for them to obtain fiber and/or to help remove intestinal parasites as it passes through their digestive tract. Or, it may help create a feeling of fullness when they are hungry.One early studyshowed that dogs tend to eat more grass early in the day and especially before feedings.\nAnother theory is that dogs eat grass to soothe different kinds of digestive upset, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. More research is needed to dive into whether any forms of digestive upset lead to an increase in grass eating but no consistent links have been found thus far.\nHint: Those “grass-saving” supplements for dogs don’t work — and may even harm your pup.\nIs eating grass a sign of sickness?\nProbably not. Based on the studies to-date and general observations, there is not a consistent link between illness and eating grass. And while many pet parents consider illness to be the most likely reason dogs eat grass,studies don’t supportthis theory. In one study, only eight percent of the respondents reported seeing signs of illnessbeforetheir dog ate grass, and of that group, only 22 percent reported that their pups actually vomited after doing so.\nInanother study, researchers who compared grass-eating behaviors of dogs with mild gastrointestinal disturbances to those without any GI signs concluded that a healthy dog was actually more likely to eat grass thanone with diarrhea, specifically. This study did not compare their findings to other kinds of digestive upset, such as nausea and/or vomiting, so the results concluded only that diarrhea was not a motivator for dogs to eat grass.\nSome like it hot (but not most dogs). Here are the season’s health hazards, from fleas to foxtails.\nOr, is eating grass normal dog behavior?\nFor most dogs, eating grass is normal stuff. It’s possible that pups eat grass to pass the time or to aid in digestion, or because — here’s a shocker — the grass tastes good. It’s likely that eating grass is a natural behavior for dogs, one passed down from their wild ancestors, wolves. And in reality, no one knows for sure why they do it, or if they all do it for the same reason.\nGrass may also provide dogs with a source of fiber which has many health benefits. Fiber is technically a form of carbohydrate that is not broken down during digestion. In this manner, it adds bulk to the stool which can help toprevent constipation,increase feelings of fullness without added calories, and some fiber also providesnutrients to the microbiome. Some pups take their grass-eating too far, though, and if they are obsessively eating large amounts of grass it may be worth a deeper investigation.\nYou need to be extra careful if your dog or cat is your gardening assistant.\nReasons why dogs eat grass\nThere are numerous theories as to why dogs eat grass. In nearly all cases, they are just that: theories. These are unproven but based on observations or specific case studies. And it may be that different dogs eat grass for different reasons, so more than one possibility may be true. Here are some common reasons we think they eat grass:\nThis has always been a common myth to explain why dogs eat grass. Many people believe that they eat grass to soothe their stomachs, or as a way to induce vomiting. This has not proven true in research studies.\nMultiplestudies have foundthat dogs eating grass do not show any signs of digestive upset, and only a small handful of dogs will vomit after eating grass. More research is needed to further investigate; however, so far this does not seem to be true for most dogs.\nThis is another common theory that dogs eat grass or other non-food items out of boredom. There are no studies that have focused on this particular theory for grass-eating, but there are general studies that show some dogs develop behavior issues related to eating non-food items when they are bored or understimulated.\nOne early study noted that dogs tend to eat more grass in the beginning of the day and especially prior to feedings. This led to the theory that they may be eating grass to satiate themselves and create feelings of fullness.\nDogs with certain behavioral disorders including anxiety and compulsive behaviors sometimes eat non-food items. This isknown as pica. It can also happen due to an underlying medical condition so any cases of suspected Pica should be fully evaluated by a vet.\nSome theories have suggested that dogs eat grass as a source of fiber or due to other deficiencies. Nutritional deficiencies can be a cause for pica in general, so a dog that is eating large amounts of non-food items should have a thorough medical work-up.\nBoutique NYC nursery The Sill gives us the dirt on dog-friendly plants.\nWhy is my dog eating eating grass and throwing up?\nThere is not one definitive answer to this question but lots of possibilities. First, it is interesting to note that research studies have not shown a link between eating grass and vomiting. The majority of dogs in these studies did not vomit after eating grass so we don’t think that eating grass routinelycausesthem to vomit.\nWe also do not have any scientific proof that dogs who are already feeling sick and have digestive upset will seek out grass more than healthy dogs. Knowing this, it is hard to make a definitive link between eating grass and vomiting. It is possible that some dogs eat grass whether they are sick or not and so it is pure coincidence that sometimes they vomit after eating grass.\nIn other cases, if they are mostly eating grass early in the day, especially prior to a meal, they may be vomiting due to a condition known asbilious vomiting syndrome. These pups tend to vomit when their stomach is empty for too long.\nThe best way to determine why your dog is eating grass is to take note of the pattern; is it usually happening around a certain time of day? How does it relate to their meal times? Does it coincide with periods when they are alone more versus times when you are home? These factors can help drill down on what may be motivating them to eat grass and can help your vet give you more answers.\nWhen it comes to why a dog vomits, there are many possible causes. If your dog is vomiting frequently or has other signs of illness such as decreased appetite, low energy, weight loss, and/or diarrhea, they need to be evaluated by a vet right away. Their vomiting may not be directly tied to eating grass but rather a sign of an underlying illness.\nNo, not usually, but there are exceptions. We know from carefully designed research studies that the majority of dogs who eat grass do not vomit afterwards. However, we have probably all met a dog who ate grass and then vomited at least once in their life. In reality, there are many reasons a dog might puke after eating grass.\nOne might be pure coincidence, that they were going to throw up anyway and just happened to also eat grass. Another could be that they ate so much grass that it actually irritated their esophagus or stomach; sometimes it is not a true vomit but more of a coughing-up of the grass before it even reaches their stomach. Yet another reason could be that there was something on the grass that caused them to vomit, such as fertilizer chemicals or excrement from another animal.\nThriving plants are spring’s whole thing—but these offenders can be perilous to pets.\nShould I let my dog eat grass?\nWhether or not to let your dog eat grass depends on a number of factors. How much do they eat? Do they vomit afterwards? Is this grass relatively safe for them? For the average dog who occasionally chews on some grass in the yard and has no adverse reactions, there is no harm in letting them continue.\nFor dogs who seem to be obsessively eating grass, whether or not they actually get sick, it is important to speak with your vet and make sure there is not an underlying problem that needs to be addressed there. And if you have reason to believe the grass is not safe for them to eat, certainly take steps to prevent them from eating it and keep your pup safe.\nKiddie pools aren’t just for kids!\nHow to keep keep your grass dog-friendly\nDon’t usepesticidesthat contain toxic chemicals, and consider making aspecial dog-safe spacein your yard that eliminates plants that may be toxic, too.\nReduce the risk of parasite transmission by making sure that your dog only eats grass in your own backyard. Dispose of dog poop regularly, and consider making apet-waste digester.\nFoxtails — small,dry seedsproduced by invasive, grass-type weeds — are prevalent in many lawns and pose a serious risk to dogs. If you have foxtails in your yard, be diligent about removing them (dig or pull them up, or soak them with vinegar at ground level), and watch your dog closely when in the yard.\nIt’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with all the plants in your yard so you can also keep your dog away from anyplants thatmay be toxicif eaten, and consider replacing them with dog-safe landscaping.\nOne caveat when it comes to grass consumption: long, rigid grasses with sharp edges have been known to cause throat abrasions and can also cause intestinal blockages. The esophagus is sensitive, and in some cases, dogs who eat this type of grass can experience a serious medical issue. If yourdog is coughing, vomiting, not eating, or showing signs of irritation after eating these kinds of grasses, it’s best to contact your veterinarian immediately.\nGarden organically, for the sake of both the planet and your dogs.\nHow to stop a dog from eating grass\nIf you are concerned that your dog is too focused on eating grass, has adverse reactions after eating grass, or that the grass your dog eats may not be safe, there are many ways to stop your dog from eating grass. This includes:\nIf you arewalking with your dog, you can help navigate where they go and intervene right away if they try to chow down on the grass.\nThesemuzzles are designed for comfortso that your dog can easily pant and even accept treats while wearing it, but they can’t pick up objects and eat them. It is important to train your dog to get used to the muzzle and to make it a positive experience so they are comfortable wearing it.\nYou can work with your dog tolearn this cueusing positive reinforcement techniques. As your dog becomes more familiar with the cue, it will be easier to redirect your dog from unwanted behaviors like eating grass.\nFor all dogs, but especially those who may be eating grass due to boredom or anxiety, this is key. Be sure your dog’s day is filled with plenty ofmental enrichmentactivities like food puzzles, training sessions, socialization, and lots of exercise so that they don’t resort to undesirable habits to fill their time.\nIf you feel that your dog’s behaviors are extreme, seek out a veterinary behaviorist who can help. These cases can be very challenging and may require expert insight as well as formal training and even medication for dogs who are suffering from extreme anxiety and behavioral disorders.\nWe’ve got the fabulous gardener’s take on pet-friendly plants.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nVomiting has many possible causesincluding eating non-food items, infections, parasites, congenital problems, chronic diseases, and more. It is very important to see a vet if your dog is vomiting repeatedly.\nCoughing also happensfor many different reasons, just like in people. Dogs can get infections, develop chronic diseases, and even have anatomical problems that cause coughing. You should always have your dog examined by a vet if they develop a cough.\nDog-proofing your yardinvolves multiple steps. Be sure to consider safe ways to enclose the space, planting non-toxic plants, and blocking off other dangers like swimming pools, fire pits, and barbecues.\nReferences:\nWhy Dogs Eat Grass\nWhy Dogs Eat Grass\nApplied Animal Behavior Science: Reduction in Grass-Eating Behaviours in the Domestic Dog,\nApplied Animal Behavior Science: Reduction in Grass-Eating Behaviours in the Domestic Dog,\nApplied Animal Behavior Science: Characterisation of Plant Eating in Dogs\nApplied Animal Behavior Science: Characterisation of Plant Eating in Dogs\nUniversity of New England School of Psychology: Grass-Eating Patterns in the Domestic Dog,\nUniversity of New England School of Psychology: Grass-Eating Patterns in the Domestic Dog,",

  "page_content": "When it comes to training your pup, you probably already know that treats are one of the most effective ways to tell them they did a good job (and should do whatever they just did again). But if you want your pup to learn most effectively, treats alone aren’t the solution.A new studypublished inScientific Reportsfinds that as much as your pup wants a snack, they equally value your positive emotional reinforcement.\nRecently, researchers set out to measure how emotions influence learning in pups and found that dogs who received pets and praise in addition to treats performed better than pups who received treats and light reprimanding. In other words, keep the treats coming — but if you want your dog to be stress-free and in peak performance, they’ll need tons of chin scratches and “good dog” affirmations, too.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nItispowerful enough, even for the tough cases, and itisthe best choice—here’s why.\nThe experiment\nDuring the experiment, trainers taught new cue words to pups for tricks they already knew; instead of being given the cues in Hungarian, which their pet parents speak, the dogs were given cues in English. Two different training styles were given to each pup: “permissive” and “controlling.”\nDuring permissive training sessions, dogs who succeeded were given praise, pets, and treats. During controlling sessions, dogs who succeeded were given treats (without praise and pets) and dogs who failed were softly scolded with phrases such as “No,” or “Not good,” in a firm, but not threatening, voice.\nOffering fewer treats can actually be agoodthing.\nAfter each separate training session, dogs napped in a lab, where they were given EEG scans to analyze their memory functions. Performance was retested after sleep.\nThe researchers found that the controlling training method caused pups stress and increased the amount they slept. In particular, dogs who were scolded showed the stress-related behavior of seeking proximity to their pet parent.Previous studieshave found that stress can have a negative impact on a dog’s ability to learn.\nAll dogs performed better during their first training session than the second, regardless of the method applied. “The reason for the order effect may be the well-known phenomenon in the literature that information learned first is often easier to remember than what is learned later in a similar context,”per Phys.org.\nThere was one difference, though: Dogs who were first exposed to controlling sessions and later exposed topermissive sessions showed much greater pre- to post-sleep improvement during their second sessions. Researchers hypothesize that this may be because the pups experienced a more positive training environment than they expected.\n“Our results indicate a central role of positive reinforcement both in enhancing their performance and welfare,” wrote the study’s lead author, Vivien Reicher. Further research is needed to delve into the impact of positive reinforcement on learning, but these results suggest that giving pets and praise to pups can significantly lower stress and potentially improve their memory — so, no need to play the stoic trainer. Go ahead and smother your pup in pets; it’s good for everyone.\nReferences:\nPotential Interactive Effect of Positive Expectancy Violation and Sleep on Memory Consolidation in Dogs\nPotential Interactive Effect of Positive Expectancy Violation and Sleep on Memory Consolidation in Dogs\nStudy Shows Rewarding Dogs with Praise and Petting Helps Them Learn More Efficiently\nStudy Shows Rewarding Dogs with Praise and Petting Helps Them Learn More Efficiently\nTraining Methods and Owner–Dog Interactions: Links With Dog Behaviour and Learning Ability\nTraining Methods and Owner–Dog Interactions: Links With Dog Behaviour and Learning Ability",

  "page_content": "Picture this: You walk through the door after a long day, only to find the trash strewn across the floor and your dog hiding in the corner — ears back, tail tucked, the whole shebang. It’s that classic “oops, I did it again” expression that might have you believing your dog is feeling the weight of their misdeeds.\nIn fact, mostpet parents believethat dogs know when they’ve done something wrong and display that “guilty look” as a result. But while some dog behaviors may look like guilt, current scientific understanding suggests that dogs may not experience true guilt as humans do (lucky, aren’t they?). Instead, they often react to their pet parent's disapproval based on learned cues, such as tone of voice or body language.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nYou’re reading that correctly: You’re likely the problem, or at least a part of it. Let’s unpack the mystery behind those guilty expressions and explore the fascinating science behind canine emotions.\nThe science behind whether or not dogs feel guilt\nConducting studies about dog emotions can be difficult, because we’re not dogs and can’t really understand what they’re feeling. We can only base our hypotheses on observable behaviors and physiological responses.\nThis means researchers often rely on a combination of behavioral observations, neuroscientific data, and anecdotal evidence from pet parents to piece together our understanding of canine emotions. While it’s not a perfect science, these methods offer valuable insights into the rich inner world of our beloved four-legged companions.\nDespite the convincing guilt look your pup flashes you when they’ve done something they shouldn’t have, they don’t actually feel guilt. Onestudy revealsthat dogs show this look of guilt in response to being scolded by their pet parent. It even found that dogsdon’tshow the “guilty look” when their parent refrains from scolding them. So, the scolding and the guilty look are clearly connected.\nWe now know that many pet parents think their dog knows they’ve done something wrong and displays guilty behavior as a result. Butresearch findsthat this way of thinking is potentially problematic, because there is currently no unanimous agreement among scientists regarding the appropriateness of attributing emotional comprehension or experiences to animals.\n“Nobody can know what an animal is feeling, but dogs tend to respond more to your behavior and their ability to predict what your behavior is going to be,” says Robert Haussmann, Certified Trainer, Canine Behavior Consultant, and Co-Founder ofDogboy NYC. “They use appeasement behavior such as paw lifting and putting their ears back in response to or anticipation of your actions, and it’s easy for us to anthropomorphize that into guilt.”\nEssentially, we’re assigning human behaviors to non-human beings, and there’s no scientific evidence that we should be doing that…like, ever.\nWhy does my dog look guilty?\nPut simply, dogs look guilty because they’re responding to our behavior. If they know we scold them and get upset when they've done something wrong, they may exhibit behaviors that we interpret as guilt.\n“The thing that also comes after a dog does something that we don’t like is our behavior,” Haussmann explains. “If every time we come in and react in anger when they misbehave, they’ll try to de-escalate the situation by offering appeasement behavior. They may even engage in appeasement behavior proactively because they can predict that we’re going to freak out about something.”\nAppeasement behavior in response to human scolding is their way of trying to diffuse any tension and make amends. It’s like they’re saying, “Let’s bury the bone and move on from this little mishap, okay?” They give these appeasement signals through their body language, which is crucial to understanding canine behavior.\nIf you think your pup’s practically George Carlin, science backs you up.\nWhen it comes to that infamous guilty look, understanding dog body language is the key to unlocking the mystery. That pitiful puppy-eyed expression isn't necessarily a sign of genuine guilt, but more often a display of appeasement behavior.\nDogs are masters at reading our emotions, so when they see us frowning or hear the sharp tone of our voice after discovering the trash scattered across the living room floor, they instinctively respond with behaviors like avoiding eye contact, cowering, or even offering a submissive grin. Learning to interpret these subtle cues helps us better understand our canine companions and strengthens the bond we share with them.\nCommon behaviors that resemble guilt\nWe’ve all caught our dogs red-handed, only to be met with a series of adorable yet suspicious behaviors. Here are some common behaviors that will likely have you second-guessing your pup's innocence:\nHiding or avoidance: Your dog may retreat to a hiding spot or avoid making eye contact with you altogether (#awkward). This behavior suggests that they're trying to escape the situation or potential consequences of their actions.\nHiding or avoidance: Your dog may retreat to a hiding spot or avoid making eye contact with you altogether (#awkward).

This behavior can indicate that they're trying to avoid confrontation or appease you after realizing they’ve misbehaved.\nThe role of training and reinforcement\nTraining our dogs isn't just about teaching them cool tricks like rolling over or playing dead. It also plays a crucial role in shaping their behavior and preventing those guilty looks that often leave us scratching our heads. By using positive reinforcement techniques and consistent training, we can help our dogs understand what's expected of them and build a strong bond based on trust and communication. But before you do that, it’s important to get your thinking right about the situation and do some training of your own.\n“The first thing you need to do is uncouple the dog’s behavior from our own sense of right and wrong,” Haussmann explains. “If you come in and the dog looks guilty, it’s possible that you might be freaking your dog out and you need to check your own behavior. For example, if your dog grabs some food off the counter, try not to outwardly punish or scold your dog.”\nOne way to do this is to teach them cues such as “down” and “stay,” so they know your expectations and what is and is not appropriate behavior. Prevention, Haussmann says, is another important aspect of behavior management that is often overlooked as a training solution. Block them off from the kitchen while you’re cooking so they don’t snag food off the table, or if your dog always gets into the garbage, consider getting a garbage can with a lid.\n“Proactive management and training are the best solutions to preventing unwanted behaviors,” Haussmann explains. “If you get the guilty look, that means there’s a good chance your dog is responding to your behavior, and you should adjust that.”\nFAQs (People also ask):\nMost likely, yes. Dogs are highly attuned to our emotions and body language, so they can often sense when we're upset or angry. However, their understanding may not be as nuanced as a human’s, and they may interpret our anger as a change in our behavior rather than understanding the specific reason behind it.\nNo, dogs don't understand accidents in the same way humans do, but they can learn from the consequences of their actions. With consistent training and reinforcement, dogs can learn appropriate behavior and reduce the likelihood of accidents in the future.\nWhile dogs may exhibit behaviors that resemble embarrassment, such as avoiding eye contact or slinking away, it's unlikely that they experience the complex emotion of embarrassment in the same way humans do. These behaviors are more likely a response to their perception of our reactions rather than a true sense of embarrassment.\nYes, dogs can learn to associate certain actions with negative consequences, such as being scolded or punished. They may display behaviors like avoidance or submissive postures when they sense they've done something wrong, but their understanding may be more instinctual than conscious.\nYes, dogs are masters of reading human behavior and learning how to manipulate situations to their advantage. While they may not feel guilt in the same way humans do, they can learn that certain behaviors, such as looking guilty, result in attention or avoiding punishment.\nReferences:\nAre Owners’ Reports of Their Dogs’ “Guilty Look” Influenced By the Dogs’ Action and Evidence of the Misdeed?\nAre Owners’ Reports of Their Dogs’ “Guilty Look” Influenced By the Dogs’ Action and Evidence of the Misdeed?\nBehavioral Assessment and Owner Perceptions of Behaviors Associated With Guilt in Dogs\nBehavioral Assessment and Owner Perceptions of Behaviors Associated With Guilt in Dogs\nDisambiguating the “Guilty Look”: Salient Prompts to a Familiar Dog Behaviour\nDisambiguating the “Guilty Look”: Salient Prompts to a Familiar Dog Behaviour\nWhich comes first: a nervous person or a nervous pup?",

Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThere are pros and cons of sleeping with your dog — for both of you.\nDog sleeping positions\nBesides sleeping on their back, there are five other main sleep positions. A calm and content dog may sleep on their side. Yet when it’s cold out, you may notice your dog sleeping in a donut position; this allows a dog to trap their body heat and stay warm. A dog who may want to stay alert while sleeping may be in a sphinx pose, this pose helps them be ready to jump up at a moment’s notice.\nCertain breeds may sleep with their back and front legs outstretched like Superman; this pup may have a lot of energy and always be on the go when not asleep. Then there’s the cuddlebug, a dog who loves to snuggle with you to sleep. That is one affectionate pup.\nIt’s a personal preference, but here are the pros and cons.\nWhat does it mean when dogs sleep on their back?\nHave you caught your dog sleeping belly-up on their back? There are a few reasons why they may sleep like that.\nOne reason may be that they are feeling hot. Is the sun shining in the window, is it summertime? Your dog may snooze on their back to cool off. Typically, fur on a dog’s belly is the thinnest, so they may lay belly up to help let some cool air bring down their body temperature. Did you know dogssweat from their paw pads? This may be another reason why you may find your dog belly up. This allows their paws to be up in the air helping cool them down.\nDogs communicate with other dogs using body language, when you see a dog flip over on their back while interacting with another dog they are saying, “Don’t hurt me.” A more submissive or formerly abused dog may roll on their back to show a human they are not a threat.\nIf your pup has muscles or areas of their body that feel sore or are injured, they might want to lie on their back to relieve pressure from where they feel pain. An older dog may lie on their back ifthey have arthritis, for example.\nA dog sleeping on their back in your presence should be considered an honor that shows how relaxed and secure they feel in the environment you have created for them. Your dog is so content that they will lie in the most vulnerable position a dog can lie in.\nDogs need more sleep than humans. Here’s how much is healthy.\nDog sleeping positions when sick\nIf your dog doesn’t feel well, they won’t necessarily be sleeping on their back. You may see them curled up in a ball or assuming whatever their usual sleeping position is.

  "page_content": "No one likes being misunderstood — including your pup. And while they might bark, whine, howl, and yip their little hearts out, at the end of the day, they don’t speak your language (without buttons, anyway) — which leaves a lot of room for human error.Studies have found that people really aren’t all that great at understanding their pup’s body language and vocalization habits, especiallywhen it comes to aggression. But modern tech might offer a solution.New researchfrom the University of Michigan (U-M) is using artificial intelligence to decode different kinds of dog barks, which could do wonders for helping us understand our canine friends.\nHow AI is decoding dog barks\nAn early challenge in building the new AI model was that, unlike human speech, there is not much data on dog barks available publicly. “Animal vocalizations are logistically much harder to solicit and record,” Artem Abzaliev, a U-M doctoral student and the lead author of the study,told University of Michigan News. “They must be passively recorded in the wild or, in the case of domestic pets, with the permission of owners.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nSo, instead of starting from scratch, the researchers turned to existing AI models that were originally designed to analyze human speech patterns; there are many of these models, thanks to programs like language translation and voice-to-text. “These models are trained to distinguish nuances in human speech, like tone, pitch, and accent, and convert this information into a format that a computer can use to identify what words are being said, recognize the individual speaking, and more,” reported U-M News.\nAdvancements in artificial intelligence are changing everything from the way we detect illnesses to how we keep our pets safe.\nUsing one of these models, Wav2Vec2, they used vocalizations from 74 dogs of various breeds, sex, and ages to train the AI to analyze the tones of different dog sounds. Some of the included contexts were aggressive barking at a stranger, anxious barking, positive squealing, negative squealing, barking during play, and barking in fear of a stranger.\nThe AI was able to accurately determine the breed, sex, and age of different dogs by listening to the vocalizations. It could also effectively determine the contexts behind the barks, such as whether the sound was playful or aggressive.\n“There is so much we don’t yet know about the animals that share this world with us,” said Rada Mihalcea, a U-M professor and the director of U-M’s AI Laboratory. The researchers are hoping that further tech advances can be made to help animal behaviorists, researchers, and pet parents learn how to interpret and respond to the emotional needs of the dogs in their lives.",

  "page_content": "In February of 1944, an American soldier fighting in New Guinea stumbled upon afour-pound Yorkshire Terrierin an abandoned foxhole deep in the jungle. He brought the dog back to his basecamp, where she was named Smoky and acquired by Corporal William A. Wynne, who made a bed for her out of a green felt card table cover and fed her with his own C-rations and the occasional can of Spam.\nOver the next two years, Smoky accompanied Wynne and his comrades on 12 combat missions and survived 150 air raids and a typhoon at Okinawa. She even saved Wynne’s life one night when she guided him to duck just before eight of his fellow soldiers were gunned down around him.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nSmoky’s greatest achievement, though, was perhaps as the first recorded therapy dog. While Wynne was in the hospital, in 1944, Smoky slept in his bed at night and accompanied nurses on their rounds during the day. Because they spent time with Smoky in the hospital and on the battlefield, soldiers were able to find relief from the stresses of war and a reason to be glad, even in the midst of so much horror.\nSmoky became a celebrity and in the decades since, the use of dogs and other animals to help relieve trauma has only increased. But how exactly do animals help people process their trauma?\nScientists confirm the myriad physical and psychological benefits of pet parenthood.\nA true comfort in the storm\nIn her paper“Transforming Trauma: Resilience and Healing Through Our Connections With Animals,”Marguerite O’Haire, associate professor of human-animal interaction in the Center for the Human-Animal Bond in the College of Veterinary Medicine at Purdue University, explores the ways animals are utilized in the treatment of trauma.\nFor people who have experienced trauma, animals can serve as a source of nonjudgmental support and stress-reducing companionship, provide positive outlets for joy and laughter, and be a safe haven for physical touch and emotional vulnerability.\nO’Haire writes that for people trying to heal, “the significance of an animal companion in providing a sound sense of safety and wellbeing (in times of uncertainty and otherwise), an increased capacity for self-regulation, and the impetus for functional reengagement with the social environment cannot be underestimated.”\nIn her paper, O’Haire focuses on what she calls the three core categories of trauma: crisis response, child and family violence, and PTS. Crisis response is how one reacts in the wake of a crisis, be it anatural disaster,like a hurricane, or manmade disaster, like a terrorist attack. During this delicate and difficult time, animal intervention, especially with dogs, can be tremendously helpful.\nO’Haire says that working with a therapy dog can “build a bridge” between the traumatized person and crisis team member or mental health professional. The dog can also “act as a safe and calming presence” and a “transitional object to encourage present-minded thoughts and provide those in crisis with a reality-orienting focus.”\nExperts share the science-backed ways our pets offer us emotional support.\nAnimal therapy in abuse situations\nWhile a crisis response tends to be temporary, child and family violence and PTS often result in ongoing, sometimes lifelong issues. In the case ofchild and family violence,pets are sometimes a victim’s only source of love and affection.\nAnimal interventions can be tremendously helpful in the aftermath of this kind of abuse. “Physical contact involved in stroking the animal may release tension and assist those with trauma to achieve physiological self-regulation,” O’Haire adds. “For children in particular, the animal may play a critical role in reducing fear and distress during otherwise unpleasant and challenging interactions with adults, such as reliving traumatic events for the purposes of reporting [a crime] or testifying [in court].”\nDogs are so effective in cases like this that in 2015, black LabradorsDozer and Lupejoined former California District Attorney Michael Ramos’s team as part of the San Bernardino County Special Victims K-9 Unit. The dogs worked inside the courtroom, supporting children and families while they provided testimony about the physical and sexual violence of which they had been victims.\nWhen it comes to treating PTS, “the presence of an animal often offers a source of safety and support,” O’Haire writes. “Animals can alsoreduce lonelinessand create connections among friends and family members through positive interactions, which may be especially important for individuals with PTS who are often socially isolated. In a more formal capacity, animals can be involved in [animal-assisted interventions] or trained as service animals to assist with individualized needs, and to address specific, daily challenges caused by PTS.”\nThe next time they try to kiss your face while you’re in corpse pose, let them.\nAnimals can also provide what is called a“biofeedback function.”Service dogs, for example, can be trained to recognize when a person is experiencing a heightened state of stress and will nudge or lick the individual until they shift their focus to the dog, at which point they can start relaxing and utilizing mindfulness techniques to pull out of their panic and refocus on the present.\nAs far as helping with the processing of everyday stressors, there is probably not a pet parent alive who does not find the company of their pet soothing in one way or another. And you certainly don’t have to be suffering from unresolved trauma to find comfort and joy in the companionship of a pet.\nBut just because an animal-assisted intervention works for a traumatized person, doesn’t mean it will work for a non-traumatized person. For instance, a soldier experiencing PTSD might sleep better and more deeply with their dog in the bed beside them. According to Dr. Brian Chin’s paper“Co-Sleeping with Pets, Stress, and Sleep in a Nationally-Representative Sample of the United States,”people not suffering from PTSD will generallyexperience worse sleepwith their dog in the same bed or even just the same room.\nThe important thing, whether you are experiencing trauma related-difficulties or suffering from unusual or unmanageable stress, is to seek professional help. As incredible as they are, animal-assisted interventions “should not be perceived as a stand-alone or replacement treatment,” O’Haire writes. Animal therapy, combined with the expertise of a trained (human) therapist, could be the key to gaining the peace you need and deserve around this.\nReferences:\nThe World’s First Therapy Dog Was a World War II Pacific Veteran\nThe World’s First Therapy Dog Was a World War II Pacific Veteran\nSmoky War Dog\nSmoky War Dog\nCo-Sleeping With Pets, Stress, and Sleep in a Nationally-Representative Sample of United States Adults\nCo-Sleeping With Pets, Stress, and Sleep in a Nationally-Representative Sample of United States Adults\nThe Impact of Human-Animal Interaction in Trauma Recovery\nThe Impact of Human-Animal Interaction in Trauma Recovery\nBiofeedback\nBiofeedback",

  "page_content": "Have you ever caught your dog obsessively licking the floor, leaving you wondering what's behind this peculiar behavior? While occasional floor-licking is generally harmless, excessive or persistent licking may indicate an underlying issue that requires further investigation.\nThe sentiment is nice, but...\nWhy is my dog licking the floor?\nDog parents often wonder if there’s an official medical term for some of the weird stuff their dogs do. Usually, there’s not. But there is a commonly used term for when a dog is constantly licking the floor — excessive licking of surfaces, or ELS. Pretty fitting.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nDogs with ELS will lick objects or surfaces for an unusual amount of time or frequency, or with unreasonable enthusiasm. ELS, by itself, is not a disease but a behavior that is often a consequence of an underlying issue.\nHere are some possible reasons your dog may be obsessively licking the floor:\nDogs use their keensense of smellto seek out food, especially at home. They know which of their people are messy eaters and where the crumbs are likely to be. Dogs may lick the floor in search of the tiniest morsels of food, leaving nothing behind. They can also sense if that sauce that was spilled on the floor wasn’t cleaned up as well as you think. Speaking of cleaning, considerpet-safe cleanerswhen wiping up spills.\nNausea will make some dogs lick a lot; they’ll lick their lips, the air, and odd surfaces. Some dogs may lick the floor excessively to try to calm their queasiness. Nausea can stem from many causes including dietary changes, dietary indiscretion, metabolic disease, or toxin ingestion.\nDogs with underlying gastrointestinal disease may also lick the floor excessively. Diseases of the gut can cause nausea and discomfort that trigger this behavior. Astudy conductedat the University of Montreal's Veterinary Teaching Hospital looked at 19 dogs with ELS (Excessive Licking Syndrome). The study found that 17 of the dogs had an underlying gastrointestinal disease. These diseases included inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis,Giardiainfections, and infiltrative diseases where abnormal cells infiltrated the lining of intestinal walls. The study also revealed that many of the dogs’ compulsive licking improved after their underlying disease was treated.\nDogs experiencing oral pain may drool and lick excessively. The pain can occur fromperiodontal disease, tumors, ulcers, or foreign objects stuck in the mouth. If a dog won’t stop licking the floor and is coughing, they may have irritation in their throat or esophagus.\nBehavioral changes in dogs can stem from seizure activity, brain tumors, or inflammatory diseases affecting the central nervous system. Dogs with partial or focal seizures may display odd repetitive behaviors like biting the air or licking the floor. These behaviors will continue despite calling to get their attention.\nSenior dogs can developcognitive dysfunction syndrome, which is similar to dementia in people. These aging dogs can display abnormal behaviors like wandering, staring off, house-soiling, and excessive licking.\nCompulsive disorders in dogs lead to behaviors that are exaggerated, inappropriately repetitive, and out of context. These behaviors can include licking surfaces, chasing shadows, chasing their tail, pacing, and over-grooming to the point ofself-trauma. Initially, dogs may display these behaviors out of fear, anxiety, excitement, or attention-seeking, but with time, they get out of control.\nDogs may also repeatedly lick the floor to alleviate stress and boredom. Licking can be triggered by stressful situations like environmental changes, new people, thunderstorms,or fireworks. The act of licking releases endorphins, “feel-good” hormones that can help ease times of stress.\nSometimes, dogs will constantly lick the floor out of lack of something better to do. Dogs that lick out of boredom should be provided with mental stimulation and physical activity before licking progresses to more destruction chewing, scratching, and digging.\nCertain conditions can make dogs experience polyphagia, which is a term for excessive hunger. These conditions include diabetes mellitus, Cushing’s disease, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), and hypethyroid disease (rare in dogs). Steroids, like prednisone, can also cause excessive hunger. When there’s no food in sight, dogs with polyphagia may resort to licking the floor in search of a snack.\nTheir toes might smell like Fritos, but there’s no way they tastethatgood.\nWhen to consult a veterinarian\nIt's normal and not a big deal if a dog licks the floor occasionally. But when the behavior becomes excessive, it should be checked out. If you’re concerned your dog is showing signs of ELS, talk to your vet. Your dog should definitely be examined if you notice these signs:\nLicking that interferes with normal activity\nLicking that interferes with normal activity\nLicking that continues despite trying to get a dog’s attention\nLicking that continues despite trying to get a dog’s attention\nOther compulsive behaviors like tail-chasing and over-grooming\nOther compulsive behaviors like tail-chasing and over-grooming\nFoul odors from the mouth\nFoul odors from the mouth\nPain\nPain\nVomiting or diarrhea\nVomiting or diarrhea\nPoor appetite\nPoor appetite\nExcessive thirst and urination\nExcessive thirst and urination\nYour vet will likely want to rule out medical causes before deeming constant floor licking as a strictly behavioral issue. A medical history and physical exam help determine the next steps. If there is concern for a gastrointestinal or metabolic issue, then bloodwork, urinalysis, fecal exam, and imaging (radiographs or ultrasound) may be recommended.\nIf there is concern for an underlying neurological condition, referral to a veterinary neurologist may be necessary for an MRI and spinal fluid sampling. If medical issues are ruled out, then the focus can shift to environmental and behavioral modification techniques.\nAnd when you want to draw the line attoomany kisses.\nPreventing excessive floor-licking\nExcessive floor-licking in dogs can’t always be prevented, but ensuring that your dog’s needs are being met can help reduce the risk of conditions that trigger excessive licking.\nStay current on preventative care.\nStay current on preventative care.\nProvide regular dental care (including teeth brushing at home and professional cleanings).\nProvide regular dental care (including teeth brushing at home and professional cleanings).\nFeed your dog a balanced, high-quality diet.\nFeed your dog a balanced, high-quality diet.\nAvoid going overboard with treats and snacks.\nAvoid going overboard with treats and snacks.\nProvide plenty of physical exercise and mentation stimulation.\nProvide plenty of physical exercise and mentation stimulation.\nMinimize stress.\nMinimize stress.\nAnd when will itstop?\nFAQs (People also ask):\nDogs can lick the floor for many reasons including gastrointestinal disease, oral pain, neurological disorders, stress, excessive hunger, and boredom. Sometimes, they just find crumbs on the floor though.\nA dog may frantically lick the floor to ease nausea, oral pain, or anxiety. If frantic licking is persistent, it may be a sign of compulsive disorder or cognitive dysfunction.\nDogs oftenlick the people they loveas a sign of affection. Licking releases endorphins that can make cuddle time extra soothing. Dogs may also lick people to get attention or simply say “hello.”\nReferences:\nGastrointestinal Disorders in Dogs with Excessive Licking of Surfaces\nGastrointestinal Disorders in Dogs with Excessive Licking of Surfaces\nHelp!

  },
  "page_content": "My dog, Finn, is not the sharpest tool in the shed. He’ll come when called — mostly. When told to “sit” and “stay,” he’ll sort of loiter. And the months I’ve spent trying to teach himbasic trickshave brought nothing but humiliation to us both. But, no matter what, I always say “Good dog, Finn!” I have to. It’s the desperate look in his eyes. This facial expression speaks volumes. It says that he loves me, he hates to disappoint, and he’d give anything to make things right.\nIt’s a wildly winsome, beseeching look that would be too on-the-nose for an animated bunny in a kids movie. It’s a look that self-captions as, “Awww,” or “Who,me?” The expression is so lethally, infamously cute that a Danish pop starwrote a songabout it. I saw it on Finn the other night, right after he woke up the entire household at 2 a.m. with loud,alarming barksbecause a neighbor deposited a little recycling.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThat deeply manipulative, adorably effective little smirk Finn fixed me with is what researchers have deemed “puppy-dog eyes.” But new research published in the journalThe Anatomical Recordshows dispels a2019 studythat dogs got this adorable look as a result of domestication by humans. This new study finds that it is also present in wild dogs.\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nThey didn’t evolve just for us, after all.\nThe 2019 study reported that an eye muscle, entirely absent in wolves, enables subtle facial movements that “increase paedomorphism.” Anne M. Burrows, as one of the study’s authors,told Australia’s ABC Newsthat this is a buzzkill way of saying that dogs “hijack our emotions.”\nIn other words, the study found that dogs have evolved over time to mimic our facial expressions and, as a result, create a very human-like, beseeching look that allows them to get exactly what they want from us. But just because that muscle wasn’t present in wolves, does it meanonlydomesticated dogs have the puppy-eye dog capability?\nHeather Smith, a researcher at Midwestern University and her team wanted to dig deeper. When they studied a deceased African wild dog (Lycaon pictus), they found that the puppy-dog eye muscles were just as developed in that dog as they were in dogs who live with humans.\n“So, it kind of debunks the idea that domestic dogs are the only canids that have this, and that they evolved specifically for us,”Smith told LiveScience.\nIf they’re following you around like your shadow, there’s a reason for that.\nPups and their people share a “mutual gaze.”\nEven if this charming attribute of dogs’ eyes is not the result of humans’ influence, it has contributed to our bond with our pups. In astatement about the 2019 study, Burrows, senior author, says that these tiny facial muscles, which flex and tire just as quickly, create a “mutual gaze” between humans and dogs that doesn’t happen between us and other pets.\nIt’s safe to say that when we see our dogs looking at us like we used to gaze at our parents when we wanted that extra bowl of ice cream, we can relate to them. Regardless of how they originally developed those pleading eyes, theydomanipulate us. Finn is living proof of that — quickly disarming my frustration with just one look.\nIt’s not like we can complain: We love to give them exactly what they want. And apparently, if we come across any wild African dogs, we might similarly influenced by them and want to fulfill their every desire. Guessing they might not be as satiated by pet store-bought treats, though.\nResearch:\nStudy Reveals the Science Behind Those Irresistible Puppy-Dog Eyes\nStudy Reveals the Science Behind Those Irresistible Puppy-Dog Eyes\nThe Science Behind Puppy-Dog Eyes, and Other Ways our Canines Communicate With Us\nThe Science Behind Puppy-Dog Eyes, and Other Ways our Canines Communicate With Us\nPuppy Eyes Didn't Evolve Just for Humans, Study of Wild Dogs Finds\nPuppy Eyes Didn't Evolve Just for Humans, Study of Wild Dogs Finds",

  "page_content": "People who say that pets don’t understand human emotions clearly have never had their laps nuzzled or tears licked away during an ugly-cry session. They have a special way of picking us when we’re down, and their unconditional love can be a salve through life’s trying moments.\nIf you’ve ever wondered what your pet is thinking as they comfort you when you cry, you’re not alone. The extent to which animals — primarily dogs — can understand and empathize with human sadness is the topic of some pretty fascinating ongoing research. So, grab the tissues — we’re exploring the latest on why and how dogs respond to tears. Spoiler alert (as if the headline didn’t give it away): they do — sometimes.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nTime to whip outThe Notebookfor a little doggie movie night.\nIt’s not in your head: Dogs do seem to be attentive to crying.\n“It’s pretty extensively established that dogs do respond to human crying,”Julia Manor, Ph.D., an animal cognition and neuroscience researcher and associate professor at Ripon College, tells us. “This has been found in audio recordings and live demonstrations with children and adults.”\nFor example, in her own work, Manor has found that pet dogs are more likely to engage with whomever is pretending to cry in the room that they’re in — be it their guardian or a stranger. “When the stranger pretended to cry, rather than approaching their usual source of comfort, their owner, dogs sniffed, nuzzled and licked the stranger instead,”the 2012 study reads.\nSeparate researchfound that dogs’ cortisol levels increased after listening to a recording of an infant crying, suggesting some level of cross-species empathy. But interestingly enough, positive emotions don’t seem to be as contagious as sad ones.For another one of her studies, Manor and her team tested how pupsreacted to human laughter. They found that laughing did not seem to impact dogs’ stress response or person-oriented behaviors (ie., eye contact, nuzzling, licking, barking) to the extent that crying did.\n“That tells us that there’s something unique about the crying emotion that may elicit responses,” she explains.\nSo far we know, based on research that has tracked dog behavior as well as physiological metrics, like heart rate variability, that crying is stimulating to pups — even more so than other displays of human emotion. Still, the question remains: why?\nResearch finds that your pup can smell when you’ve been doom-scrolling, and they get bummed out.\nThere are some theories as to why dogs are so attentive to tears.\nOne explanation for why dogs respond to human crying is that their guardians have trained them to. If you (intentionally or not) reward your dog with treats and belly rubs after they nuzzle up with you during a sob fest, they’re more than likely to do it again next time.\nHowever, there’s likely more to the story, because dogs don’t only respond to negative emotions when they come from people they know.Different breeds have shown the abilityto match images of “sad” human faces to distressed human sounds — even when the face in question is a total stranger, and the sound is in another language than the one the dog hears at home. This means that part of their tendency to “catch” the emotions of people —also referred to as an emotional contagion — is innate. In fact, it could be centuries in the making.\nWhen you consider that dogs have shared more of their evolutionary history with humans than any otherdomestic animal, it makes sense that there’s a primitive element to their empathy.\nKun Guo, Ph.D., a human-animal interaction researcher at the University of Lincoln, says that the ability to read and respond to human emotions has likely served dogs well for eons. “You could argue that empathy is one of the most important functions for animals to survive because it promotes pro-social behavior and can build a link between your emotions and social functions,” he says of the evolutionary value of empathy.\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nIf your dog doesn’t react when you cry, they still love you.\nFast forward to today, and Manor caveats that not every dog will engage with humans as they cry. In her research, she’s found that around 30 percent of pups “could care less” about tears.\n“People will be crying, and the dogs are like, ‘Yeah, you need to deal with that yourself,’” she jokes. If you’re in this camp, it doesn’t mean your dog doesn’t love you. It could just be a reflection of their breed (Guo has an interesting theory that short-nose breeds might be more likely to respond to crying because their eyesight can be more attuned to nuances at close distances than longer-nose breeds) or their baseline anxiety level.\n“Dogs who are a little more anxious tend to show more person-oriented behaviors to the person who is crying,” Manor has found.\nThe impact of a dog’s breed and behavior are just a few aspects of animal empathy that researchers are still trying to wrap their heads around. In the future, Manor and Guo predict more studies will look into how dogs respond to other emotions like anger and other physical states of being like illness or injury. We could also see research on how other animals,such as cats, mice, and chickens, experience emotional contagion.\nUntil then, remember that the next time life has you reaching for the tissues, your dog could be right behind you — be it because of how you trained them or how they were born. Either way, their companionship is real, reassuring, and worthy of a runny-nosed smile.\nResearch:\nDogs Functionally Respond to and Use Emotional Information from Human Expressions\nDogs Functionally Respond to and Use Emotional Information from Human Expressions\nEmotional Contagion: Dogs and Humans Show a Similar Physiological Response to Human Infant Crying\nEmotional Contagion: Dogs and Humans Show a Similar Physiological Response to Human Infant Crying\nDogs Recognize Dog and Human Emotions\nDogs Recognize Dog and Human Emotions\nEmpathic-Like Responding by Domestic Dogs (Canis familiaris) to Distress in Humans: an Exploratory Study\nEmpathic-Like Responding by Domestic Dogs (Canis familiaris) to Distress in Humans: an Exploratory Study",

    "title": "Most Dogs Don’t Really Like Being Hugged, New Study Finds",

  },
  "page_content": "We know this isn’t great news (don’t kill the messenger), but according to new research, you might want to hug your dog a little less. Yes, it sounds like an impossible task — but it’s for your pup’s own wellbeing. It turns out that, as much as we love hugging our dogs, most dogs really don’t like being hugged. Don’t worry, there are still plenty of ways to snuggle that you’ll both enjoy. But those big, entrapping, squeeze-y embraces? They’re probably stressing your dog out.\nDogs show signs of stress in response to hugs\nBack in 2016, Dr. Stanley Coren, an expert on dog behavior and intelligence,analyzed the first 250 picturesof dogs that popped up when he searched “hug dog” on Google Images and Flickr. He found that 81.6 percent of the dogs exhibited some signs of discomfort in the photos, 10.8 percent had neutral body language, and 7.6 percent looked comfortable. “Signs of stress can be tongue-flicking,ears down, face averted, eyes showing ‘half-moons’ of white, tightly closed mouth, rigid facial muscles, and furrowed brows,” Dr. Karen B. Londonwrote for usin her in-depth explanation of Dr. Coren’s research. “Dogs who are relaxed and happy tend to have open mouths, relaxed facial muscles, and no signs of stress.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThe new research, recently published inApplied Animal Behaviour Science, was able to go a step further and analyze videos of pups rather than still images. By looking at videos, they were able to examine behaviors like nipping, yawning, and blinking that are harder to spot in photos. The study reviewed the 80 most popular videos of dogs being hugged on social media platforms.\nThey found that 68 percent of the dogs avoided eye contact and turned their heads, 44 percent licked their lips or nose, 60 percent flattened their eyes, 81 percent blinked, and 43 percent panted. In 68 percent of cases, the pups actually nipped or bit at the human. These are all signs that the dogs were uncomfortable during the hugging interactions.\nHumans don’t understand signs of stress in dogs\nYour instinct might be to argue thatyourdog isn’t stressed out by hugs. It’s possible they’re not — all pups are different, and as both studies found, not all dogs appear uncomfortable when hugged. But it’s also true that humans aren’t super great at recognizing signs of puppy stress.“Our results showed that many human behaviors may be concerning as humans tend not to necessarily understand the body language or vocalizations shown by dogs, when interacting with them,” Elizabeth Ann Walsh, the study’s lead author, wrote.\nA PSA to pay better attention to our best friends’ body language.\nWhen Dr. Coren conducted his initial research, he received a huge pushback from pet parents who claimed their pets loved being hugged…but they shouldn’t have been so confident. “To prove this, they sent me or posted pictures of themselves hugging their dogs, completely ignoring the fact that these images often contained the very same stress signals that I had pointed out in my report,”Dr. Coren wroteinPsychology Today.\nDogs are cursorial animals, Dr. Coren added, which means they’re designed to run swiftly — so, when pups are faced with a threat, their primary defense is to take off. This may be why hugs are so stressful for dogs; when they’re restrained, they’re deprived of their ability to defend themselves by running away if a threat occurs.\nSome of the body language that humans find cute in dogs, such as yawning and lip-smacking, are actually calming signals, Walsh explained. And misunderstanding your pup’s behavior can have serious consequences. “This can cause feelings of discomfort, anxiety, fear, distress, and confusion in a dog, which may result in a fractured human/dog bond, welfare issues for the dog, and the possibility of a dog escalating to exhibit defensive/agonistic behavior should communication fail,” Walsh wrote.\nSo, as well as you think you know your pup, it’s worth familiarizing yourself with somesigns of puppy stress. “We advocate for increased education for both adults and children in canine communication,” wrote Walsh. It’ll make your pup happier — even if it means fewer hugs andmore ear scratches.",

Half the time when I make pancakes, I accidentally test our smoke alarm, and let’s just say the dogs in my home are not fans.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nMost sound-related research on dogs focuses on infrequent but (from the dog’s point of view) catastrophic sounds, like gunshots and fireworks. Many everyday sounds that also upset dogs are largely ignored in studies, despite their negative effects on our best friends’ emotional state.\nHow to keep your dog mentally and physically safe this New Year.\nSo, what sounds actually scare dogs?\nSudden loud noises are one of the most common causes offearful behaviorin our dogs, but not enough is known about dogs’ reactions to the range of sounds that frighten them. Fear of sounds can cause anxiety in dogs, and living with either fear or anxiety (or both) can lead to a decreased quality of life and serious welfare concerns.\nIn a2021 study, researchers discoveredhigh frequency beeping and low frequency continuous sounds such as alarm clocks, plumbing, smoke detectors, cell phone noises, washing machines, dishwashers, vacuum cleaners, and fans canstress dogs out.\nThey also found that many pet parents underestimate their dogs’ negative emotional responses to such sounds, and often get a chuckle out of their dogs’ reactions.\nWhat do dogs do when they hear loud noises? Bark, obviously.\nIn this study, researchers surveyed 386 dog parents to learn how their dogs react to common household sounds. The purpose was to find out if dogs react to such sounds with fear, stress, and anxiety. Two-thirds of the people reported that their dogs were not fearful, and 70 percent of them had never sought help for a behavioral problem. However, when asked specifically about whether their dogs wereafraid of loud sounds(fireworks, thunder, gunshots), half said “yes” and half said “no.”\nIt will come as no surprise to anyone that the most common response to a loud sound was barking, which half of the dog parents reported. (That’s why the “mute” button on Zoom is such a Godsend!) Nearly one-third of people in the survey said their dogs retreated when they heard something. Behaviors associated with more serious stress in dogs, such as trembling, salivating, lip licking, panting, and howling were less common but still prevalent.\nResearch finds why dogs may suddenly become super sensitive to sounds.\nLow-frequency sounds cause dogs to jump on you, apparently.\nIn addition to analyzing dog behavior through surveys, the scientists also examined the behavior of dogs and people in videos and compilations posted online that featured dogs hearing common household sounds. The goal of this part of the study was to figure out how often dogs react to everyday household sounds, what those reactions are, and how people interpret their dogs’ responses.\nResearchers searched for such videos on YouTube, using search terms such as “fear,” “afraid,” “fire alarm”, “beeping”, “smoke detector,” and “vacuum.” They classified sounds as high-frequency intermittent (translation: beeping or chirping sounds, such as an oven timer or a low-battery warning from a smoke detector) or low-frequency-constant (translation: humming sounds like a microwave or a robot vacuum). The majority of pups in the study trembled when they heard a high-frequency-intermittent sound. But they retreated, lunging and jumping on their parents when the sound was a low-frequency continuous one. The videos also show that high-pitched repeated sounds caused more distress than low frequency continuous ones.\nIt's also worth taking note of how the pet parents reacted in these videos. In half of them, the pet parents acted like spectators — they did not comment, console, or react to their dog's behavior in any way. Perhaps this is because people were purposely trying to get video of the dog’s behavior to share online. The next most common reaction from these folks was amusement (45 percent of videos), followed by an attempt to analyze the behavior by discussing what was going on and why (26 percent).\nHow to cope with dog anxiety—from training to medication.\nStudying video isn’t the best way to get results, but this is compelling evidence.\nStudying videos online doesn’t meet normal standards for scientific rigor in terms of random sampling (the authors make this point — nobody’s trying to pull a fast one here). Plus, people don’t typically share the subtle or the barely noticeable dog responses — that usually doesn’t make the most engaging content — so most of the videos show extreme responses.\nBut the scientists make a compelling case that behaviors indicating fearfulness and anxiety are frequently seen in response to ordinary household noises, not just thunder and fireworks. Another big takeaway: The pet parents in the survey underestimated their dogs’ negative emotional responses to upsetting sounds. Unfortunately, some were also amused by their dogs’ fearful reactions.\nMy suggestion: Let’s pay more attention to our dogs’body languageso it doesn’t take a study to tell us that they hate the sound of the vacuum. And I'm for more compassion when it comes to these very real fears. They don’t laugh at you when their sudden barks make you jump, right? (Well, not that you know of).",

  },
  "page_content": "A dog’s sense of smell is so powerful, it’s kind of hard to wrap our heads around it as humans. There’s evidence that pups cansmell stress,fear,certain types of cancer, andCOVID-19— and working dogs have been trained to smell drugs, explosives, andlost or trappedpeople.\n“A dog’s sense of smell is estimated to be 10,000 to 100,000 times more sensitive and accurate than a human’s,” says veterinarianDr. Lindsay Butzer. “Dogs have up to 300 million olfactory receptors in their noses, compared to about six million in humans.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nSo, if there are certain scents that you can’t get enough of (like that heavenly section of the mall that has a Bath & Body Works), the same is likely true for your dog — times 50. A 2022study published infound that most dogs favor a few specific scents. And turns out they might even be some of the same as yours.\nDogs’ favorite smells\nTo find out which scents dogs favor, researchers presented 32 odor samples to 14 different dogs. Cameras recorded the dogs and tracked their interest in the different scents throughout multiple trials. When dogs sniffed for longer than two seconds, this was considered a positive interaction.\nThey found that dogs loved lavender, blueberry, blackberry, peppermint, and rose. Lavender, in particular, has researched benefits for pups and humans alike. “Lavender has been proven to affect a variety of species (including dogs and humans), with the scent of lavender shown to lower the heart rate of dogs … as well as increasing the rest and sitting time while riding in a car,” wrote the study’s lead author, Agata Kokocińska.\nAnd we didn’t need a study to tell us this, but the results also showed that dogs really,reallylove the smell of food. Obviously. “The odor of food was always preferred by the dogs over the other smells presented in the same trial,” Kokocińska wrote.\nA psychologist explains how stimulating scents can influence a dog’s behavior.\nUsing smells for enrichment\n“The sense of smell in dogs is not only a highly developed sense, but also plays a huge role in the animal’s welfare,” Kokocińska wrote. In humans and dogs, scents can evoke past memories and impact mood.\nKnowing how important scents are to pups, some shelters have begun using scent enrichment to calm dogs. Morag Greaney, the former adoption and foster supervisor at McKamey Animal Center in Chattanooga, Tennessee, used to spray essential oils mixed with water onto the shelter grounds daily.\nHe believed the scents calmed the dogs and the variety of new smells improved their environment. “I would absolutely recommend that dog owners use scents with their animals,”Greaney said.\nUse caution\nJust keep in mind that many essential oils aredangerous for pets— including cinnamon, peppermint, and pine. The more concentrated the oil, the more dangerous it is, so keep your pet a safe distance from essential oils, and be sure the scent is not onthe no-no list(good news:Lavender oilis generally safe for dogs).\nTheASPCAAnimal Poison Control Center (APCC) advises, “Using an oil diffuser for a short time period in a secured area — one that your dog or cat cannot access — is not likely to be an issue.”",

  "page_content": "Aresurfaced videofeaturing soccer player Nuno Tavares sharing a moment of affection with his two pups sparked a heated debate online in earlier this year, and raised a question: “Should we let our dogs lick our faces, lips, and even mouths?”\nThe video, originally posted in 2021, captured the Arsenal left-back (currently on loan to Nottingham Forest Football Club) allowing his dogs to give him kisses on the tongue and sparked a divisive conversation online as to whether you should allow your dog to get so… up close and personal.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nUnderstandingwhyour dogs feel the urge to shower us with slobbery kisses is the first step in navigating their displays of affection. Why do pups want tolick us all the time? ​​And what is the relationship between a dog’s kisses and our own health? Delve into the reasons behind a dog’s desire to lick your face; whether their saliva is as clean as they’d like us to think; and whether allowing your dog to lick your face, lips, or mouth is best practice.\nThe sentiment is nice, but...\nWhy does my puppy lick my face? (And should they?)\nTypically, dog behaviors serve as aform of communication, and licking is no different. Licking may occur when your dog is excited, or showing affection, but it can also happen whenyour dog feels nervous. Your dog may lick to explore their environment or try something they think smells tasty. You may catch your dog licking the kitchen floor or the cement outside the ice cream shop.\nDid you just finish a meal and your dog wants to lick your lips? They are probably trying to get a taste of that yummy meal you just had. Another reason a dog may lick is to show affection or grooming behavior, similar to how they show affection to the mother dog.\nSometimes, when a dog licks, it can be an appeasement or nervous behavior. Have you evergiven your dog a big hug, and they seemed hesitant and licked you, looking at you out of the corner of their eyes? (This is, of course called“side-eye”: When your dog looks at you and their pupils move to the side of their eye causing you to see the whites of their eyes, sometimes called whale eye.) Your dog is telling you that they accept that affection, because they trust you but do not truly enjoy what you are doing to them, they are telling you they are uncomfortable.\nLicking can also be a sign of affection. Who doesn’t love returning home for the day and your dog greets you at the top of the stairs wiggling their entire body, then they plant a lick or two on your face? It is all fun and games until you remember where you saw them putting their tongue earlier that day. Then you may think twice about letting them lick you…\nBoundaries, folks. Boundaries.\nShould I let my dog lick me on the mouth?\nThe decision to let your dog kiss you on the mouth ultimately comes down to personal preference and risk tolerance. For most healthy individuals, the risk of contracting an illness from a dog’s saliva is relatively low. However, if you fall into the more susceptible categories or have concerns about potential bacterial transmission, it’s advisable to err on the side of caution.\nPet parents should consider factors such as their dog’s diet, overall health and an individual’s susceptibility to infections. It’s crucial to strike a balance between fostering a strong bond with your dog and ensuring responsible pet parenting. If you choose to allow your dog to lick your face, establishing boundaries and practicing good hygiene can mitigate potential risks.\nHere are some considerations to help you make an informed decision:\nHealth status: If you or someone in your household has a compromised immune system, it’s best to limit direct contact with your dog’s saliva, especially around the mouth.\nHealth status: If you or someone in your household has a compromised immune system, it’s best to limit direct contact with your dog’s saliva, especially around the mouth.\nDietary habits: Dogs on a raw diet may carry additional bacteria, so be mindful of their diet and take appropriate precautions.\nDietary habits: Dogs on a raw diet may carry additional bacteria, so be mindful of their diet and take appropriate precautions.\nPersonal comfort: If the idea of your dog’s kisses on your mouth doesn’t sit well with you, there’s no harm in setting boundaries.

You may have also seendogs eat their own poop, other animal poop, old rotten food, dead carcasses, and more. Even though a dog’s mouth contains certain antibacterial enzymes that can help heal wounds it does not mean that their mouths’ are clean.\nThere is always a chance of contracting a pathogen from your dog’s saliva. Many pathogens your dog may have can not be transmitted from pup to human, but some can be passed on to you.\nIf a dog is eating a raw diet, there is a greater risk of you contracting a sickness. If your dog eats raw meat, you could contract Salmonella orE. coli. When preparing raw meals for your dog, it is always good to take extra precautions when preparing their meals. Be sure to clean the area where you prepared the food, as well as clean their bowls after each use and the area where they eat their meals. It may also be best to wait a few hours before allowing your dog to lick you after they have consumed raw meat.\nAnother reason you should not allow your dog to lick you is when you have an open wound. Allowing your dog to lick your open wound can make you sick or in extreme cases septic.  The bacteriaCapnocytophagacan live inside your dog’s mouth. This bacteria does not make your pet ill but can make you sick. Most people who have come in contact withCapnocytophagawill not get sick, yet there is a chance of getting sick from this bacteria if you have a compromised immune system.\nIf you have a compromised immune system, it is best to proceed with caution when allowing a dog to lick your face, or anywhere on your body for that matter. If a dog has licked you, and it was unavoidable (they are just so darn cute) it is always good to wash the area a dog has come in contact with, especially if you are at a greater risk of illness.\nThen, there’s the issue of dog allergies. Not only can people beallergic to pet dander, but some people are allergic to dog saliva. If you are allergic, allowing a dog to lick you may cause an allergic reaction. You may get a rash, swelling, or become itchy. This happens because certain proteins from dog saliva may cause your immune system to react and attack those proteins as if it were a virus.\nWhile keeping your dog or cat at home where they belong.\nWhat should I do if my dog licks me on the mouth?\nIf your dog surprises you with an unexpected kiss on the mouth, here are some practical guidelines to help minimize potential risks to you.\nWash your face: After any dog-human interaction involving licking, wash your face thoroughly with mild soap (or face wash) and water to reduce the likelihood of transferring any bacteria.\nWash your face: After any dog-human interaction involving licking, wash your face thoroughly with mild soap (or face wash) and water to reduce the likelihood of transferring any bacteria.\nMonitor for symptoms: Keep an eye out for any unusual symptoms, especially if you or someone in your household is more susceptible to infections.\nMonitor for symptoms: Keep an eye out for any unusual symptoms, especially if you or someone in your household is more susceptible to infections.\nEducate yourself: Stay informed about the potential risks associated with dog saliva, especially if your dog is on a raw diet.\nEducate yourself: Stay informed about the potential risks associated with dog saliva, especially if your dog is on a raw diet.\nSet boundaries: Establish clear boundaries with your pup to control licking behaviors.

Consistent training can help reinforce these boundaries and create a healthy balance between affection and hygiene.\nIf they’re following you around like your shadow, there’s a reason for that.\nHow to train my dog to stop licking me\nIt is always best touse positive reinforcementwhen training a behavior. Using positive reinforcement when training your dog creates apositive association with the behavioryou are working on. When your dog has been reinforced positively, they are more likely to choose to do the behavior you are asking of them. When training your dog not to lick, it is important to be as neutral as possible, rather than getting angry or annoyed.\nAny reinforcement — even negative reinforcement — may cause your dog to continue the unwanted behavior of licking. Yelling “no” and telling someone to stop means they should stop the behavior. Dogs do not speak our language, and if they have not been taught the word stop or no, they may think you are pulling away and saying “no” as a game. They may begin to act more silly and playful, because they think you are riling them up. So, rather than engaging with a dog when they lick you, turn away from them.\nWhen turning away or ignoring them, you want to be neutral; this will help your dog stay positive and better understand what you are asking them to do. When turning away, go slowly, do not make any noises, and avoid eye contact. When a dog looks away from another dog it is signaling to the other dog they need a break or do not like what is happening. So, by avoiding eye contact, you are telling your dog you did not like that.\nBe sure to be consistent, it is very confusing to your dog if you allow them to lick you one day but not another. If you continue to look away or ignore your dog when they lick you, the behavior will decrease over time. If turning away from them does not work, you may have to move away or leave the room completely, when doing so remember to be as neutral as possible. Your goal is not to upset your dog, your goal is to teach your dog to understand your message: When you lick me, I leave.\nThe age-old debate of whether to let your dog kiss you on the mouth boils down to a combination of personal preference, health considerations and risk tolerance. While your dog’s affectionate kisses are heartwarming, being aware of potential health risks allows you to make informed choices that prioritize both your wellbeing and the bond you share with them.\nReferences:\nSalivary Proteomics of Healthy Dogs: An In-Depth Catalog\nSalivary Proteomics of Healthy Dogs: An In-Depth Catalog\nLick of Death: Capnocytophaga Canimorsus Is an Important Cause of Sepsis in the Elderly\nLick of Death: Capnocytophaga Canimorsus Is an Important Cause of Sepsis in the Elderly\nComparative Proteomic Study of Dog and Human Saliva\nComparative Proteomic Study of Dog and Human Saliva\nCapnocytophaga\nCapnocytophaga\nCan You Be Allergic to Dog Saliva?\nCan You Be Allergic to Dog Saliva?",

  },
  "page_content": "Earth’s magnetic field is essential for the survival of life on this planet. Without it, solar wind would blast our little blue dot with charged particles, stripping away our thin atmosphere and leaving our home as barren and lifeless as Mars. The magnetic field is not static, though. Rather, it is in a state of constant flux — its strength increasing and decreasing as it is bombarded by solar wind. This causes the magnetic north and south poles to shift throughout the day and even flip every 300,000 years or so.\nAccording to NASA, the last flip was about 780,000 years ago, so another one could be imminent. If and when it happens, Earth’s magnetic field will weaken for a time, allowing more cosmic radiation to reach the planet’s surface. It’s also likely that multiple magnetic poles will pop up in unexpected locations across the planet, disrupting communication systems and power grids and causing problems for birds, whales, and other migratory animals that use the field to navigate. It could also really mess with your dog’s preferred pooping orientation.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nYes, the earth affects your dog’s bathroom habits.\nThat’s right: It turns out dogs are actually quite sensitive to shifts in Earth’s magnetic field and, when allowed to do so, will poop and pee with their bodies oriented along north-south magnetic field lines. This, according to a study published inFrontiers in Zoology, in which Vlastimil Hart and his colleagues observed 70 dogs across 37 breeds over a two-year period as they did their business while on walks in an open field.\nWhat they found was that when Earth’s magnetic field was calm and its shifts were mild, dogs would orient themselves along magnetic field lines. When the shifts were more extreme, however, they would abandon this behavior entirely.\n“Typically, the daily declination [relative angle of magnetic field lines] comprises westward-shifts in the morning and eastward-shifts in the afternoon,” Hart writes. “While the magnetic field is rather stable at night. But magnetic storms, which disrupt the magnetic field, are common.\nIt’ll mess up a lot more than your pristine white sneakers.\n“Our analysis of the raw data indicates that dogs not onlyprefernorth-to-south direction, but at the same time they alsoavoideast-to-west direction. The fact that larger and faster changes in magnetic conditions result in random distribution of body directions — i.e., a lowering of the preferences and ceasing of the avoidances — can be explained either through disturbing or conscious ‘shutdown’ of the magnetoreception mechanism.”\nHow do dogs evensensea magnetic field?\nThe evolutionary purpose of this magnetic field sensitivity is not entirely clear, but Hart and his team suspect it may allow dogs to better orient themselves the same way a human might take out a map and turn it and their body north to figure out where they are. This kind of calibration, however, only makes sense when the reference (aka the magnetic field) is stable. That’s why, when the magnetic field is active, dogs ignore it entirely, the same way you would ignore a compass if the needle was swinging back and forth.\nHart and his colleagues were not able to determine exactlyhowthe dogs in the study perceived the magnetic field, though — only that they did so. Did they see it? Smell it? Hear it? Or was it more of a feeling of comfort versus discomfort, depending on how they oriented themselves? They couldn’t say.\nThe study did show that there was no discernible difference in sensitivity between male and female dogs, but Hart and his team were unable to say one way or the other if there were differences across breeds, due to the study’s small sample size.\n“That makes sense,” says Jessica Jacobson, a New York-based dog behavior expert and celebrity dog trainer atDapper Dog Training, who was not involved in the study. “I’ve never noticed a difference in pooping and peeing behaviors across gender or breed, either.”\nApparently, your dog’s age has something to do with this superpower of sorts.\nJacobsonhasnoticed differences based on a dog’s age, as did Hart and his team, who found that pups between the ages of two and a half and seven were most likely to exhibit magnetic field sensitivity. Hart couldn’t say why, but the finding makes sense to Jacobson.\n“The younger a dog is, the less tuned in it may be to its preferences,” she says. “It can also take time for a dog to realize what makes them most comfortable. At the same time, it makes sense that when dogs are older, they may view pooping and peeing more as just necessary bodily functions and be less concerned with the finer details.”\nBecause they aren’t all made the same.\nSo, does this mean you should only take your dog out to poop and pee when the magnetic field is calm? “Definitely not,” Jacobson says. “A dog’s need to go to the bathroom is more urgent than their desire to orient themselves a certain way when they do, and, like the article says, they will go to the bathroom either way.”\nThere are, however, things you can do to make your pup’s potty time more comfortable. “As the study mentions, being off-leash allows the dog the most freedom to do what they want, how they want,” Jacobson says. “But that can be difficult in a city environment.” In that case, Jacobson advises that you try to leave some slack on the leash and follow your pup where they want to go without adding tension.\n“Magnetism aside, most dogs prefer to be away from people when pooping and many dogs exhibit preferences for certain surface textures,” says Jacobson. “So, try to let them take you where they want to go.” And if you notice them deliberately orienting themselves north-to-south, at least you’ll know why and that Earth’s magnetic field is calm and stable.

Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHow to treat and prevent confinement anxiety.\nSigns of canine nightmares\nJust like humans, dogs exhibit dream-like behaviors, such as muffled barks, whimpers, twitching paws, or thrashing movements. They might also be twitching or crying.\nWhy do dogs have nightmares?\nAgain, it’s hard to tell if your dog is having a nightmare, but if you see them exhibiting the signs of distress listed above, that could be the case. If you think your dog is having a nightmare, they may have one of the following conditions:\nCanine narcolepsy: Your dog may lose muscular tone before eating or playing or have frequent sleep attacks.\nSleep-disordered breathing: This happens if your dog will be a heavy snorer. They could also have a drop in their oxygen levels. This condition typically affectsbrachycephalic breeds.\nREM sleep behavior disorder: This is when when your dog displays violent motor activities when sleeping: violent limb movement, howling, growling, or biting.\nThere are two types of seizures in dogs: generalized and focal. Ageneralized seizureis when the dog loses consciousness and shows stiffening or paddling of the body. During a focal seizure, the dog may or may not lose consciousness and will display consistent abnormal movements in one body part. If you think your dog had a seizure, contact your vet immediately. Make sure you have the number of an emergency vet on hand in case of instances like this.\nSpend less time searching for your dog’s house than you do on Zillow.\nDo dogs dream like humans?\nYes, dogs do have dreams just like we do. They’re probably not having complex work-stress dreams (lucky them; their only job is to be your little baby). But if you see them moving their legs, as if in a running motion, they are likely dreaming about whatever it is they did that day, like playing fetch on the beach orplaying with a pal.\nHow to cure dog nightmares\nCreating a safe space for your dog to sleep or rest is key in helping them get restful, uninterrupted sleep. Setting up a crate or bed in a quiet area can be helpful. Dogs do well with routines, so if there is a change in your life, try to keep things as similar as possible so your pup receives optimal snooze time.\nOur dogs sleep with us, too. But these trainer-recommended dog beds—from indestructible ones for puppies to orthopedic options for seniors—are the next best thing.\nWhen to worry about nightmares\nIf you notice your pup is having consistently violent episodes while sleeping or has difficulty waking up, it may be worth talking to your vet about one of the previously mentioned health concerns (canine narcolepsy, sleep-disordered breathing, or REM sleep behavior disorder). Again, if you think your dog had a seizure, do not hesitate to contact your vet and get your dog seen immediately.\nIt can be best to avoid suddenly waking a sleeping dog, regardless of whether they are dreaming or having a nightmare. If a dog is startled awake, they may choose to react negatively. While the content of their nightmares remains a mystery, researchers confirm dogs display neurological patterns and physical signs consistent with bad dreams.\nReferences:\nSleep Characteristics in Dogs; Effect on Caregiver-Reported Problem Behaviours\nSleep Characteristics in Dogs; Effect on Caregiver-Reported Problem Behaviours\nSleep in the Dog: Comparative, Behavioral and Translational Relevance\nSleep in the Dog: Comparative, Behavioral and Translational Relevance\nCanine Idiopathic Epilepsy\nCanine Idiopathic Epilepsy\nA Prospective Observational Longitudinal Study of New-Onset Seizures and Newly Diagnosed Epilepsy in Dogs\nA Prospective Observational Longitudinal Study of New-Onset Seizures and Newly Diagnosed Epilepsy in Dogs",

    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/pet-behavior/anthropomorphizing-pets-benefits"
  },
  "page_content": "As a loyal pet parent, family reunions have always been a frustrating experience — not for me, but for everybody else involved. Coming from a long line of Irish Catholics, most of my relatives seem singlehandedly committed to furthering the world’s overpopulation. While they all share photos and stories of their children learning to walk and talk, I feel compelled to detail my dog’s (aka my baby’s) latest activities.\nI’ll chime into conversations like, “Bedtimes really are so tough for us parents; if Banshee doesn’t get her regular 15 hours she becomes such a brat.” Or, “I know, she can’t sleep without her favorite blanket, either.” That sort of thing.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nMy cousins (present at previously mentioned family reunions), call this behavior of mine “annoying,” but to veterinary professionals, this is known as “anthropomorphism” — the act of attributing human characteristics to animals. Now, I’d argue my dog and I have a lot more in common than not. For example, neither of us can pronounce — or spell without the help of AI — anthropomorphize.\nBut when I suggest she feels guilty for having an accident in the house, the pros tell me this is textbook anthropomorphism. Thankfully, for my continued happiness and barely surviving sanity, these same experts confirm that this common pet-parenting practice can do more good than bad for our cats and dogs. In fact, it might even make us better pet parents overall.\nYour pup doesn’t actually feel bad about eating your pizza.\nWhy do we anthropomorphize our animals?\n“It’s really common for people to anthropomorphize their pets, because pets are such an important part of our lives, and it’s a way that people can find connection with their pets,” explainsDr. Valli Parthasarathy, a veterinary behaviorist and co-founder ofSynergy Veterinary Behavior. We humans are gifted with — or burdened with if you’re a supervillain — the capacity for empathy.\nUnless they’ve been convicted of something truly horrible or are a fan of the New England Patriots, we generally want to know how others are feeling and if they’re happy — human or not. It’s the motivation behind every cartoon with animals, including Mickey Mouse, and even the Cheetos mascot. Heck, the movie that introduced the world to colorized film,The Wizard of Oz, effectively boils down to exploring the emotions of lions, scarecrows, and tins of oil.\nSusan Nilson, trainer and founder ofThe Cat and Dog House, notes that this type of personality projection is a simple method for us to interpret our pets’ behaviors in a way we can relate to, even if our reading is always 100 percent correct. “Whether our interpretations are always accurate is another matter. But it’s natural for us to want to try to understand our pets through a human lens, as it’s the primary frame of reference we have,” she says.\nApparently wild dogs can be pretty cute, too.\nHow anthropomorphism improves pet parenting.\nTo be clear, there are plenty of examples of anthropomorphism that already have proven beneficial to our pets. Technically speaking, taking your dog for a walk in a stroller is a form of anthropomorphism because you’re treating them as a human baby.Especially for senior pupsor those who struggle with mobility, this can provide many of the same boons as standard walks,minus the exercise. While human parents might roll their eyes when we say our cat looks angry or our dog looks upset, there is evidence to support that they might actually be trying to express these emotions.\n“Research shows that dogs have evolved to use certain facial expressions, such as raising their inner eyebrows, to mimic the type of expression humans associate with being sad,” Nilson says. She also explains that when dogs do this, their eyes may appear larger and more infant-like, which automatically triggers our human protective instincts. Over time, pups pick up on this response, so it helps them communicate and evoke certain responses from us.\nAnthropomorphizing pets may actually help pet parents communicate with them, rather than just being a thing kooky thing we do when we’re bored (as valid as that is). For their part, our pets may learn to use our anthropomorphic habits as a means of language. When your pet gives you those classicpuppy-dog eyes, you might respond in an overly attentive way because you’re assuming they’re sad or afraid. They’ll then quickly realize that face or that expression elicits a certain response, so the next time they want that reply, they’ll shoot you the same doe-eyed look.\n“The dogs learn that when they give this certain look, they get attention because they are social so different dogs learn different ways to ask for attention,” Dr. Parthasarathy says. She then equates this strategy to the same way humans communicate similar ideas. “Just like people, if they live with somebody, they’re going to go up and say, ‘Hey, I want to chat with you,’ or ‘Let’s hang out on the couch together.’ Dogs need to figure out their own ways within their family to make those same requests,” she adds.\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nAnthropomorphism strengthens the human-pet bond\nBeyond enhancing your ability to communicate with them, imprinting human characteristics onto dogs and cats can also have other subtle positive impacts. While you (read: me) spend the majority of your day staring at your pet imagining what they might be thinking and performing their presumptive inner monologue, you’re unintentionallygiving them a chemical boost.\nWe also know that mutual gazing between pets and their owners can lead to increased levels of oxytocin, a hormone associated with bonding and trust. So, when your dog, cat, or bunny is giving you those puppy-dog eyes, you are building a stronger mutual connection without even realizing,” Nilson says.\nAttributing human feelings and attitudes onto our pets can equally help us better empathize with them. No matter how much we love our pets, most of us are not experts in canine or feline behavior, so Nilson points to anthropomorphizing as a way to improve our understanding. She adds, “By recognizing that our pets are sentient beings with complex emotions, we may be more motivated to provide them with the best care possible and show greater empathy.”\nIn a way, Dr. Parthasarathy has regularly encouraged this type of thinking with pets under certain circumstances at her practice. She explains that when patients come in, they’re often experiencing varying levels of stress, anxiety, or fear. One way to console them is through helping them better understand their pet’s emotions in that moment.\n“I’ll often tell clients, ‘Imagine that you’re in your dog’s position or imagine that you’re in your cat’s position and how you would feel if this sort of situation came up,’” Dr. Parthasarathy says. “So, helping them start to understand that this is how their pet is likely feeling can help with empathy and can also help them become closer to their pet as well.”\nAnd by kids, I mean pets.\nThere aresomepossible cons to treating your pet as a human being.\nOf course, there is always the risk of misunderstanding what your animal is attempting to communicate. Assigning the wrong emotions or needs onto pets here can result in less-than-ideal outcomes.\nAs Nilson puts it, “By attributing human-like thoughts and feelings to animals, we may completely miss the mark as to why they are engaging in a particular behavior. This can result in miscommunication and misunderstanding, leading to misguided training techniques or even ignoring important health concerns.”\nShe uses the example of a dog ripping up a couch and their people assuming they did it out of spite for being left alone for too long. This common form of anthropomorphism ignoresclear signs of separation anxiety; therefore these pet parents will likely fail to address the condition properly.\nSimilarly, if you infer that your dog is feeling guilty afterhaving an accidentin the house, it’ll be easy to avoid recognizing that they simply need more frequent bathroom breaks or that it’s time to revisit house training. Dr. Parthasarathy confirms that it’s not likely these animals are performing out of spite or guilt. In fact, they might not even be capable of emotions such as these. “The research suggests that dogs and cats are not doing things out of spite. Usually, if they’re doing behaviors like this it’s due to anxiety, panic, or a medical condition,” she says.\nIn most cases, Dr. Parthasarathy stresses the importance of context over the use of anthropomorphism.Sometimes, when a dog looks guilty or upset, they’re merely acting in the way they’ve learned you want them to after previous incidents. When your pettrashes the housebefore you come home, they’ll look guilty not because they’re feeling shame — but because they know you’re upset.\n“It’s an appeasement behavior. They are really good at reading body language and so they’re really good at predicting outcomes,” she explains. In other words, they probably have previously made the association between messing the house and getting yelled at. So, as you walk through the door, they might look guilty, but they’re really justpreparing for a scolding.\nWhat’s most important is using all of the information you have to objectively deduce what your pet is feeling, asking for, or in need of. “People have to understand what the animal is communicating and that what the animal is communicating or attempting to communicate may not be the same as what us humans think they’re communicating,” Dr. Parthasarathy says.",

Further complicating the basic situation of dogs letting us see their pearly whites, they can also show their teeth in other expressions that mean entirely different things.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThe reason I loved the consultation was that a family worried they had a serious behavior problem in their household but luckily, did not have a problem at all. The confusion came about because they misunderstood one of their dog’s facial expressions. This young couple was worried about how their beloved Golden Retriever was “showing his teeth” totheir new baby. They feared that this behavior — which happened whenever they brought their daughter into the living room after a nap, when he first saw her each morning, and when they came home with her after an absence —was aggressive.\nBecause the teeth-showing was always in greeting and because their dog seemed about as threatening as a butterfly, I suspected the dog was smiling, but I needed to know for sure because a baby’s safety depended on my assessment of the situation. I had the family step into the hallway with the baby for a few minutes, then return to my office.\nThat’s when I saw it: a friendly smile by a friendly dog. It was accompanied by a loose body, a gentle but enthusiastic tail wag, a relaxed face, and what I can only describe as an adoring gaze. And, just as when humans do it, his smile involved showing some teeth.\nNo, your dog might not like receiving kisses as much as you like giving them.\nWhat’s a dog smile, and why do they do it?\nA true dog smile involves a retraction of the lips that reveals the top and (usually the bottom) teeth as well. Because it resembles an aggressive expression called a “tooth display” that I discuss below, it can freak people out. However, this kind of smile has absolutely nothing to do with aggression. In fact, it’s a friendly expression.\nWhenever a dog smiles in this fleeting, friendly, social way, I’m delighted. In my opinion, it reveals many positive qualities about that dog, and about the relationship between the dog and the recipient of the smile. Smiling dogs tend to be social, affiliative, and loving. That said, I’m not aware of any scientific studies that explore the meaning and context of such smiles.\nSo, I base this opinion on my own experience with smiling dogs, as well as discussions with other dog trainers and behaviorists over the years. Smiles are often given when greeting people the dog adores, especially if the dog hasn’t seen the person for some time. The smiles seem to indicate that the dog is over the moon about the reunion, and about the opportunity to greet the person.\nI recently discussed what we animal behaviorists call “smiles” with Chelse Wagner, a certified behavior consultant and dog trainer atDog’s Best Friend Trainingin Madison, Wisconsin. Wagner pointed out that while dogs displaying a smile tend to have loose bodies, they will oftenhold their ears backand keep their body lower to the ground; this can make them seem ambivalent or conflicted, rather than happy.\nSmiles happen quickly and are subtle. The upward movement of the lips away from the teeth is often slight, and the retraction rarely lasts more than a second. The combination of minimal movement and speed makes it a challenge to capture them photographically. You must be at exactly the right angle and height, which is difficult when a dog is moving around, often wagging not just the tail, but much of the body, as is so often the case when dogs smile.\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nWhat’s a dog grin, and why do they do it?\nWhat many people call a dog smile is really a grin — a happy, open-mouthed face of a jolly dog. This common facial expression is what many people are referring to when they say a dog is smiling, and that is just because the dog is happy and has its lips in a shape that looks like human smiles. In this “happy grin” kind of smile, which can last for minutes, the lower jaw hangs open and the corners of the lips are pulled back in a relaxed way.\nSometimes, the tongue hangs out, or is at least visible inside the mouth. Though the bottom teeth often show, the top teeth aren’t likely to. Dogs generally show this facial expression when they are relaxed and comfortable in a situation — so generally, seeing this expression is a good indication that your dog is happy.\nPanting dogs resemble grinning dogs, so if your dog has their mouth wide open and their tongue hanging out, heat could be the cause rather than happiness. It’s not always easy to tell if your dog is grinning or panting, but paying attention to the context is the best way. If your dog appears to be grinning but they just ran or played hard or it’s hot out, they may simply be panting. Your dog can be panting and feel happy or feel not so happy, but the open-mouth facial expression is not enough to let you know for sure.\nTurns out, even experts have a hard time defining these terms.\nWhat’s a fear grimace and why do they do it?\nWhen the corners of a dog’s mouth, or commissures, are pulled back tautly, it is a sign that the dog is fearful, and this facial expression is called a fear grimace. In a fear grimace, many of the dog’s teeth are visible, but the expression is not a smile, and it’s not a grin. The mouth is very tight, and the corners are pulled back, rather than up.\nTypically, a dog with a fear grimace has a tense body, and nothing about them gives a sense of relaxation, joy, or playfulness. The classic sign on fences showing the head of a salivating dog with all their teeth in full glory that says “Beware of Dog” is not a calm, confident watchdog, but rather a terrified dog with a fear grimace.\nWhat’s a tooth display, and why do they do it?\nA tooth display is an offensive threat display, and the name is accurately descriptive. It’s a visual signal in which a dog retracts their lips and shows their teeth. In a full tooth display, they show both upper front and lower front teeth, but sometimes only the upper teeth are visible. When people say, “My dog curled his lip at me,” they are often describing a tooth display in which they lift their lip a little.\nIn contrast to the loose, wiggly bodies that typical go with smiles and grins, tooth displays are usually performed by a dog who’s fairly stiff and still in both body and face. The showing of the teeth proceeds more slowly, and the expression can last for several seconds or more. Tooth displays are often an indication that a dog has been pushed past their comfort zone, perhaps by the approach or touch of another dog or a person, when they have a treasured object, or when they’re exhausted or perhaps in pain and want to be left alone.\nSometimes, a tooth display is accompanied by a wrinkled nose. When dogs are tooth-displaying and the nose wrinkles, I think it indicates a higher level of emotional arousal and a lower level of emotional control, which makes the dog less predictable.\nWhen your dog growls, they’re expressing their emotions. A study found that you’ll likely be able to understand what they’re feeling.\nWhat’s a canine play face, and why do they do it?\nDogs have an expression often seen when dogs are playing with each other called a play face. A play face involves a relaxed open mouth and sometimes you can see a dog’s teeth. More commonly, those teeth are visible during some kinds of play called bitey face and jaw sparring. Dogs often play with their mouths open, their lips retracted, and teeth fully visible.\nAlthough it’s a form of play and dogs tend to keep their mouths open wide rather than biting down on each other, photographs of the behavior can look quite alarming. When the action is frozen, you can see the dogs’ full sets of teeth, and the lips pulled back enough to see the full form of many of those teeth. When teeth are not being used on one another, and everyone is having a good time, you are most likely watching dogs happily playing.\nIf your dog growls when you get near their food or toys, read thisright now.\nTeeth show in a lot of canine expressions.\nDogs show their teeth in a variety of expressions, and they are not all smiles. To make understanding dogs even more confusing, the expression that is most like a human smile isn’t called a smile — it’s called a grin. At least both grins and smiles are generally signs that we like to see in our dogs. Play faces are less well-known than other facial expressions involving teeth, but still heart-warming to observe.\nIn contrast, tooth displays and fear grimaces are not quite so welcome, though the information that our dogs might not be feeling positive emotions is useful and definitely good to know, even if we wish they felt otherwise. There’s a lot to know about all these expressions, including that showing dog teeth does not a smile make.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nRemember, panting dogs look more like they’re grinning, which is much wider than a smile. If you see your dog grinning – and they’ve just taken part in exercise or play – they could be panting, especially if it‘s hot outside.",

So, take a chill pill, log off, and spend more time hanging out with your pet, who’s already pretty at one with their physical body. By April 24, Mercury will be back to business, and the subsequent few weeks (known as the shadow period) should see animals and humans alike returning to their normal rhythms… that is, of course, until the next one in August.\nReferences:\nBasic and Applied Research on Extinction Bursts",

    "title": "Why Does My Dog Drink So Much Water?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/why-does-my-dog-drink-so-much"
  },
  "page_content": "Your dog is probably oblivious to the latest fashion craze: coveting the perfect water bottle to match their outfit. So, what’s their excuse? Why does your dog drink so much water? Most of the time, dogs are motivated to drink by thirst cues and they are drinking water to maintain their hydration. The amount they need to drink in order to stay hydrated will vary based on many daily factors including how active they are, how hot the weather is, and how salty their diet is.\nOther factors can also influence how much they drink including certain behavioral factors and medical problems. Drinking more water on occasion is not usually cause for concern. Medical problems that tend to make dogs drink more water are usually more chronic, meaning they will drink more water all the time, not just one day. These conditions are also usually accompanied by other medical and behavioral changes. Read on to learn all about dogs and their water consumption.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nA good basic rule: It’s best to bring your own water.\nAverage water consumption in dogs\nAll this talk about drinking water may have you wondering how much water a dogshoulddrink in a day. The answer is that it depends. Just like for people, water consumption will change based on many factors. As a general rule, dogs typically drink between 60 to 80 milliliters of water per kilogram of body weight per day. To simplify the math, a 10-pound dog would typically drink about one cup of water to about one and a half cups of water per day while a 50-pound dog could drink between four and half to seven and a half cups a day. Keep in mind, calculating your dog’sactualwater intake per day is not as easy as it sounds.\nThis number includes all the water they consume, including water from food, likejuicy bites of fruitsor canned dog food, plus any sneaky slurps of toilet water or puddles, too. If you have more than one dog in the home, it can be especially challenging to know how much water each dog drinks, so try not to obsess about each milliliter of water they do or do not drink. The first step for a curious pet parent is to observe general trends, such as whether there is a sudden change in how much water their dog is drinking.\nTrue signs of a problem will also affect how much a dog pees, so if you think your dog is drinking a lot more or less, try to take note of their urination. Are they urinating a lot more or less? Does their urine look very dark yellow, or very clear and dilute? Are they suddenly having accidents in the house? All of these clues can help you figure out if there is any cause for concern or if this is just normal dog stuff.\nAs scorching, long-lasting temperatures become the new normal, here’s how to help keep your pets cool and healthy.\nNormal reasons for increased drinking in dogs\nThere are lots of reasons for a dog’s water consumption to vary so if your dog is drinking more water than usual, consider some of the following possibilities:\nWhile dogs do not sweat like we do,they pant to keep coolthrough the evaporation of water from their respiratory tract. Just like us, they lose fluids as they work to keep cool. This is more pronounced with intense exercise, long play sessions, and in hot weather. Under these conditions, they will need to drink a lot more water to replace what it lost.\nHot weather and dry climates can alsostimulate dogs to drink more. As they pant to keep cool, they are losing water and will need to replace those fluids.\nDogs sometimes pant for other reasons, such as when they feel nervous, excited, stressed, or afraid. This kind of panting still results in water loss, stimulating them to drink more to replace those losses. You may notice this after along car ride, a trip to the vet, or other situations where your dog is panting heavily.\nIncreased salt consumption or decreased water content in your dog’s food can prompt them to drink more water. This can happen after eating salty snacks — including some jerky-style dog treats and salty table snacks — as well as certain prescription dog food diets that are intended to dilute their urine. Switching them from a canned-food diet to dry kibble will also increase their drinking because they will be getting less water from their food.\nCertain medications can also cause dogs to drink more water. Some of the common medications that have this effect include steroids like prednisone, thyroid medication, certain anti-seizure medications, and diuretics, like furosemide used in the treatment of heart disease.\nYoung puppies under four months old are not able to concentrate their urine as well as adult dogs. They tend to urinate more, have more dilute urine, and as a result, may drink more to replace the fluids lost in their urine.\nTemperatures are rising dangerously. Keep your pet safe with these tips.\nWhen to be concerned about your dog’s increased drinking\nIf you think your dog is drinking an excessive amount of water, and it’s not just a one-time observation but an ongoing trend, it’s always a good idea to consult your veterinarian. If there is a medical reason for their increased thirst, it will usually be accompanied by other health changes too such as fatigue, increased urination, changes in appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, or weakness. It’s important to mention any other changes you notice to your vet so they can help you get to the bottom of their signs. Some common conditions associated with increased drinking include:\nIf your dog becomes dehydrated such as afterbeing sick with vomiting,diarrhea, or a fever, they may drink more water to compensate for fluids lost from their illness. If they are not eating because of their illness, they are especially at risk for dehydration and should be evaluated by a vet right away.\nDiabetic dogsoften drink more water and urinate large amounts of dilute pale urine. They may also have an increased appetite but lose weight despite eating more. Diabetes can be diagnosed easily by your veterinarian on routine blood and urine tests.\nThe kidneys are responsible for concentrating the urine and reabsorbing water. A dog withkidney diseasemay have a decreased ability to concentrate the urine, resulting in increased urination with very dilute urine. As a result, they need to drink more water to replace what is lost in their urine.\nCertain diseases that affect hormone levels in the body can also cause dogs to drink more water and urinate more. Some common conditions we see in dogs includeCushing’s disease, an overproduction of cortisol, and pyometra, an infection of the uterus.\nThere are many other conditions that can also cause an increase in drinking, which is why getting a thorough work-up with your dog’s veterinarian is so important. Some of these other causes includecertain toxins, excessive drooling,urinary problems, and some tumors.\nWhen to see your dog’s vet about excessive drinking\nIf you notice your dog drinking excessively on the regular, or it seems like your dog is progressively drinking more and more water over time, see your vet. Be especially proactive if they have other changes in their behavior or health, such as acting lethargic,not eating, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, or weakness.\nFor many of the conditions that cause increased thirst, early treatment is very important for getting their signs under control and preventing more serious complications. Your vet will likely recommend a work-up that includes bloodwork and a urinalysis to determine what’s going on.\nHow to manage your dog’s water intake at home\nYour dog should always have access to clean drinking water so they can manage their water intake based on their needs and thirst cues. This is especially important in the heat, after exercise, and if they have an existing medical condition or take medications that may make them extra thirsty.\nDepriving them of water can lead to life-threatening dehydration. If you are concerned about behavioral issues likeurinating in the house, or are working onhouse training a puppy, speak with a certified behaviorist on training techniques that can help you and your pup be successful without depriving them of water. This may include more frequent walks to help prevent accidents and/or blocking off certain areas of the house to prevent damage to furniture or rugs. Just like us, a dog’s thirst varies throughout the day and from one day to the next, so it is important that they can access their water whenever they need to.\nDon’t panic, but definitely talk to your vet if you’re worried about any of these conditions.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nWater intoxicationis a very rare condition in which a dog drinks an excessive amount of water, leading to dangerously low levels of critical electrolytes like sodium. This tends to happen when dogs unintentionally ingest a lot of water, such as when playing fetch in a pool or lake. Most dogs will naturally stop drinking way before this point if they are drinking due to thirst.\nNot typically, however, dogs with certain health problems like kidney disease may have an increased urge to drink, especially in the final stages of their disease. Many times if a dog is very sick, they will not eat or drink at all at the end of their life.\nMost dogs do not need to be coaxed to drink more; they will listen to their body and drink when necessary. If you want to help your dog drink more on hot days, try offering foods with extra water such as canned dog food or fruits that are extra juicy. You can also try adding a few ice cubes to their water, or a small amount of broth to entice them to drink.\nReferences:\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science: Total Water Intake and Urine Measures of Hydration in Adult Dogs Drinking Tap Water or a Nutrient-Enriched WaterMerck Veterinary Manual: Cushing’s Syndrome\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science: Total Water Intake and Urine Measures of Hydration in Adult Dogs Drinking Tap Water or a Nutrient-Enriched WaterMerck Veterinary Manual: Cushing’s Syndrome\nMorris Animal Foundation: Chronic Kidney Disease in Dogs and Cats\nMorris Animal Foundation: Chronic Kidney Disease in Dogs and Cats\nToday’s Veterinary Practice: A Stepwise Diagnostic Approach to Polyuria and Polydipsia\nToday’s Veterinary Practice: A Stepwise Diagnostic Approach to Polyuria and Polydipsia",

    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/why-dog-nibble-me"
  },
  "page_content": "Do you have a nibble-y little puppy? Well, that means you’re well-loved! Dogs nibble on their human parents as a sign of affection and communication learned during early socialization. It also serves as a way for dogs to explore their surroundings and learn about their role in social interactions.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat is the difference between a nibble and a bite?\nThe difference between a nibble and a bite can be measured in pressure. The term “bite inhibition” is used to discuss these differences in pressure. Basically, if it hurts, it’s a bite! This doesn’t necessarily reveal a dog’s intentions or motivations, though.\nWhat is the difference between nibbling and mouthing?\nAs with the difference between nibbling and biting, nibbling and mouthing differences come down to pressure. Mouthing is considered lower pressure. Mouthing often includes holding more of the object or body part(!) in their mouths as they move their jaws.\nThose little razor teeth are no fun.\nReasons your dog nibbles on you\nBecause dogs cannot speak with their humans, they must rely on other methods of communication. Your dog may nibble on you with their front teeth toinvite play, to convey a need, or to attract your attention. In any case, consider what your dog may be trying to “say” to you. Do they need water or a potty break? A “love bite” is generally preferable to a puddle of urine on the carpet.\nA relaxed, open mouth — including contact between teeth and skin — is one of many displays in play. Research shows that play in dogs is most commonlysocially motivated. Your dog may be nibbling on you because they’re exploring the possibility of a fun play session. They’re discovering what happens with their human playmate following a nibble.\nIf you’ve spent any time with a young dog or puppy, you are familiar with their desire to nibble on your hands. This is very common, because they’re using their mouths to learn more about the world around them. They’re also learning about bite inhibition, that term mentioned above. Playmates — human or dog — react strongly, often ending play when they experience a painful bite. If a puppy wants to keep playing, they need to learn to inhibit, or lower, the pressure of their bite.\nPuppies won’t have all of their adult teeth until about seven to eight months. That means that they’ll want to soothe the achesassociated with teethingfor most of their first year of life. You can help them through this tough stage by offering them frozen chew toys and by keeping lots ofchew itemsavailable.\nNaturally, nibbling on your hand can be informative for a dog. Dogs have 100-300 millionolfactory receptor cellscompared to the human’s five to six million. So, nibbling, licking, and sniffing your hands or other body parts must be a lot like rewinding and watching what your friend did that day.\nMaybe you’ve had this experience. You’re sitting in front of the TV with your dog beside you. They start to cuddle up closer to you, becoming a little more restless. This leads to nibbling your hands or arms. When a dog isn’t sure what they should or could be doing, it’s likely that they’ll want to put their mouths on something. When you’re closest, you become the target. Have somehandy optionsto direct your dog’s roaming nibbles. Chews, stuffed Kongs, or toys are great alternatives to a nibble session on your hand.\nShould I be concerned about my dog’s nibbling?\nYou should be concerned about your dog’s nibbling if it hurts you or is very frequent. It’s perfectly natural for a dog to use their mouth in both human and dog interactions. However, most dog parents would prefer that their dog communicate with them vocally or visually, not by wrapping their mouths around their parent’s hand.\nTeach your puppy new methods of communication, such as ringing bells that signify they need to go out. Instead of nibbling you to say, “I really have to pee,” your dog can ring the “potty bells.”\nShould I be concerned about my dog nibbling on people?\nWhile bite inhibition, or bite pressure, is fairly stable across a dog’s adult life, fluctuations can occur depending on your dog’s stress or excitement levels. That said, it’s ideal to help your dog interact with other humanswithoutnibbling on them.\nFor better or worse, dogs are creatures of routine, which also means that they’re prone to picking up habits. What you encourage or allow today is likely to influence future behavior. Instead of sitting around and letting your dog nibble on your friends, take your dog out for a walk or a game of fetch.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nRecognizing warning signs\nAs pet parents, it’s our responsibility to become familiar with the warning signs associated with nibbling. It’s common for humans tomisread playversus non-play signals in dogs. It’s simply a fact that dogs have teeth, and those teeth can hurt when they’re wrapped around a finger! Become familiar with dog body language. If you’re looking for inspiration, Lili Chin has been illustratingcanine body languagefor over 20 years. Chin recommends Brenda Aloff’sCanine Body Languageto get a better understanding.\nIn my profession as a dog trainer who frequently educates clients on dog signals of discomfort, one of my favorite tips is to do a comparison. What does your dog look like when they’re excited to see you come home? I’m guessing you see a loose body with fluid, wave-like motions. Now, compare that to the body language in question. If you see stiff, jerky, sharp movements, be cautious.\nBeyond reading your dog’s body language, consider the context. If you’re not actively engaged in play and your dog was just previously quite calm but begins growling or snarling, this is a warning sign. They may be guarding an item or space. They may be uncomfortable with a new person’s presence or movements. If any of these signs is combined with teeth on skin, or nibbling, you should consult with a qualified dog trainer or behaviorist.\nYour puppy is likely to grow out of nibbling, but remember that what you do with your dog today influences tomorrow. You can helpreduce nibbling and chewing behaviorsby following some basic steps.\nDon’t let your new dogwalk you.\nHow to stop your dog from nibbling on you\nKeep your dog interested in their toys by putting some of them away for a few weeks, then re-introducing them.  If your dog is in a heavy teething phase, direct them towardtoys or items to address that chewing desire.\nIf this strategy fails, it often does because the pet parent doesn’tactually interruptthe nibbling. Once you’ve marked that painful nip with a startling sound, move away from your puppy. This might require putting a barrier or door between you and your puppy for up to 30 seconds. Your immediate absence communicates that playtime ended because a playmate was hurt.\nPuppies have their own shared language, and in the midst of play, they get hurt too. They’re masters of communicating to their puppy friends that play ends when the pain starts.  Allow other dogs or puppies to educate your puppy about appropriate jaw pressure during play\nGive yourpuppy a challengeby putting their meals into afood toy. You can put your dog’s dry food into a ball or cube that spills pieces as they push it around. If you’re using a toy that holds wet food, you can still use your dry dog food by soaking it in water or in a broth, then stuffing it into a wet food toy like a Kong\nEncourage your dog to play with you while their teeth are on a tug toy or rope. This is a great way to feed their need to interact with you while meeting their nibbling needs.\nWhen you put your dog’s brain to work, less mindless nibbling occurs.  This is one of many reasons that engaging your puppy intraining activitieswill reduce mouthing and nipping.  Teach your dog somenew behavioral cues, like “spin” or  “bow, ”to share a bonding moment and add to your party tricks!\nHow to teach your pup to play nice.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nAll breeds of puppies are known for their desire and need to teethe and chew.  While many studies have examined the occurrence of bites and associated breeds, a common pitfall (among many) is accuracy in breed identification. For example, one study found that any “stocky, short-haired” animal involved in an attack was recorded as a “Pit Bull,” regardless of actual breed identification. This leads to harmful stereotypes of this breed type.\nIn short, yes and no. You should be concerned if your dog is regularly or compulsively nibbling on themselves. This could indicate allergies, pain, or parasites (like fleas and ticks). All of those issues require your attention and will probably involve a visit to your veterinarian. Chewing on their own body parts can also be a sign of anxiety.\nIf your dog is nibbling on a dog friend periodically, it’s likely not a concern. Remember, nibbling is a normal feature of dog-to-dog play.\nYou’rethe one who lives with your dog. If you strongly dislike nibbles on you or other people, interrupt the nibbling. Direct your dog to activities that you find appropriateandfill their needs. Mental engagement, exercise, and affection are necessary for your dog, and you can meet all of those needs without allowing your dog to nibble on you.

  "page_content": "It’s a common scene for dog parents. You’re going about the day when your pup runs up to you with their signature joyful bounce. Clearly, this is an invitation for attention, so you respond with an enthusiastic “Go get your ball!” Seconds later, they return and drop it in front of you.\nNaturally, you take this event as further evidence that your pup is wise beyond their years and species. Actually, maybe it’s more than that. You then consider the idea that your dog might be a genius who represents the next stage in canine evolution and is mere years from speaking English fluently.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThe truth is… somewhere in the middle. They very well may understand the word “ball” perfectly but, somewhat unfortunately, that’s not unusual for dogs. New research confirms as much but adds that their vocabulary could be even more vast than we previously believed. Led by a team at Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary,a studypublished last week inCurrent Biologyfound that dogs can fully understand the words for several objects.\nThis study findsthat dogs can process numbers in a similar fashion to their humans.\nYour dog actually knows themeaningof that word.\n“Dogs do not only react with a learned behavior to certain words,” Marianna Boros, an ethologist at Eötvös Loránd University and lead author on the study,said in a statement. “They also don’t just associate that word with an object based on temporal contiguity without really understanding the meaning of those words, but they activate a memory of an object when they hear its name.”\nAny trainer could tell you that dogs can be taught certain cues after repetition, but Boros and her team wanted to investigate whether the animal understands terms outside of reward or cadence. For this, the researchers examined the brain activity of 18 dogs by connecting them to an electroencephalogram machine. If you’re like me and struggled past the first two syllables of “electroencephalogram,” just imagine a far less invasive version of the Coke can test on Eleven inStranger Things. It was basically that.\nPet parents were instructed to bring objects familiar to their dogs, with most choosing toys like balls, Frisbees, ortug ropes. However, some also brought along other recognizable household items, including leashes, collars, bowls, slippers, and even phones. They’d then present the objects one at a time to their pups while researchers tracked their brain activity.\nTo determine the dog’s cognitive understanding of each item, pet parents would alternate between correctly and incorrectly identifying aloud what they were holding to their pet. For example, they’d show the animal a Frisbee and say “Frisbee” before then presenting a leash and saying “collar.”\nIf only there were dogJeopardy!.\nWhen dogs had to identify the mislabeled item, there was often an uptick in their brain activity because they had to do additional processing to think of the right word. The researchers took this as a sign that the pets had made a cognitive connection between the object and the word, implying that they create mental representations of objects in their minds. The team originally assumed this ability was solely linked to animals with large vocabularies, but their tests proved otherwise.\n“In our study, some dogs were familiar only with a few object names, while other dogs knew quite many object names according to their owners. However, we did not find a relationship between the number of object words dogs knew and the size of the mismatch response,” Boros says.\nAccording to the study, this type of experiment has also been performed on humans to determine cognitive understanding to a similar effect. “This suggests that the capacity to understand words in a referential way is generally present in dogs as a species and not just in dogs who have experience with a large number of object words,” Boros adds.\nA new study found that kids, especially young girls, benefit from having a pup.\nYour dog knows what you’re saying — even if they pretend they don’t.\nThe findings ultimately concluded that 14 out of the 18 dogs displayed brain activity that indicated they understood the words. A variety of breeds were involved, including Border Collies, Poodles, Miniature Pinschers, Labrador Retrievers, and mixed-breed dogs, among others. They were also of varying ages falling anywhere between one and 10 years.\n“Based on our study we believe that if a dog understands the meaning of an object word, it will understand it in a referential way, no matter how many words it understands,” Boros explains before offering some sage advice. “Therefore, we would encourage owners who see that their pup is particularly enjoying playing with objects to name those objects frequently.”\nThe research team noted that their findings also suggest that contrary to cues, dogs may understand the word you’re saying to them but not fully grasp the task you’re asking. So, if you say, “Go get your ball” they might recognize you’re talking about their ball but not understand what you’re asking them to do with it.“Even if the dog is at random when playing fetch, it might still understand the meaning but can get distracted by different object features,” Boros adds.\nResearchers say dogs actually have a pretty good sense of what we’re thinking.\nIn another scenario that I find a bit too familiar, the team added that dogs may understand you’re saying “ball” and are simply choosing to ignore you about it.Unfortunately, we very well could be to blame for that attitude. As Boros puts it, “Dogs have been selected for over 5000 generations to cooperate and communicate with humans. It is therefore possible that their domestication process played a role in the emergence of their capacity to understand object words.”\nSo, the next time you’re trying to get your dog to bring you the “alien toy” from their basket, for example, and they stare at you blankly, don’t let them fool you. They could very well understand what you’re saying and are simply choosing to ignore you — like the beautiful genius they are.\nReferences:\nNeural Evidence for Referential Understanding of Object Words in Dogs",

  },
  "page_content": "Into the bathroom. Under the covers. Where hasn’t your pup followed you? Dogs are naturally social and tend to like to be around their people, which is why we’re not surprised when they seek out our company.\nYet, so many dogs follow us consistently and with such enthusiasm the term “Velcro Dog” is readily understood. The familiar experience of our dogs scampering along with us no matter how mundane the reason for our movement (“Buddy, I’m just going to get my charger!”) raises the question, “Why does my dog follow me?”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nIf they’re following you around like your shadow, there’s a reason for that.\nReasons dogs follow their pet parents\nGenerally speaking, when a dog follows you, it means they just want to be around you (relatable, because you don’t want to leave their side, either!). Dogs are (newsflash!) naturally social animals who crave companionship and security, which they seek and receive from us. They form strong bonds with their pet parents and stay close for emotional support. Perhaps the real question iswhythey want to be around us … and so close!\nHere are a few reasons dogs want to be around us so much they follow us wherever we go.\nAs mentioned, dogs are social. Theyform bondsquickly and deeply with the people in their lives, and they tend to want to stick close to those people. Dogs who constantly follow their humans are displaying their sociability and emotional connection.\nDogs want our attention. If we move, they follow, perhaps in the hope that their motion will attract our attention. Even the most loved and cared-for dogs who have lots of daily activities will spend a certain amount of time waiting for the next interesting thing to happen. When we get moving, they presumably view our actions as a sign that the attention they seek is about to be bestowed upon them.\nFood! Sometimes we move when we’re getting ready to feed them (and ourselves). Therefore, many dogs trot along in eager anticipation of getting a meal, or atleast a snackor a little handout.\nDogs are generally eager to be on the move, so when we’re in motion, they join us. Of course, just walking around the house isn’t their favorite way to get going. Many dogs seem ever-hopeful that when we get up, we’ll head outside for a real walk with them. This is especially true if we head in thedirection of the leashor the door.\nMany dogs associate our movement with departures. When we head to the garage, the car, or the front door, our dogs may follow along to monitor the situation, seemingly checking to reassure themselves that we’re not leaving or that if we are, they’ll be going, too.\nFrequently, dogs who are unable to cope withbeing left alonecan’t bear to have us out of their sight. If we leave, they experience a form of panic. Because they’re unable to tolerate being alone, they follow us to be in our constant company and to avoid any separation at all.\nOne reason why a dog would follow you, even if you’re just going to the bathroom, is boredom. Following us gives them something to do. So many dogs are looking for stimulation of any sort —games,food puzzles,walks,training… more of anything that fills their days with joy. Perhaps it’s more interesting to accompany us than just to lie there and watch us.\nReinforcement drives behavior, and good things have happened when they’ve followed us in the past — a play session, an outing, a training session or maybe just some petting. If therelationship is a good one, our dogs associate being around us with feeling happy. Many dogs follow their humans because experience has taught them good things happen when they do.\nDogs who are feeling sick orexperiencing painoften want to be near us for security or to seek help. When something is bothering them because they are sick or injured, it’s common for dogs to stick by us no matter where we go, even if that means constantly following us around.\nSome dogs are more clingy when they are uncomfortable about something, and one common cause offeeling uncomfortableis a thunderstorm. If your dog is usually a little more independent but is glued to you during storms, you’ve probably noticed the pattern. However, some dogs begin to follow us when the storm is on its way but has not yet arrived.\nMany dogs begin to feel uneasy when the wind picks up or when the barometric pressure changes. The reason is a little harder to figure out if that’s the case because a thunderstorm doesn’t happen every time it’s windy or the pressure drops.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nShould I worry if my dog follows me all the time?\nA dog who follows you around is not necessarily cause for concern. However, in some situations, that worry is warranted. For example, if your dog can’t handle you being in another room even briefly without freaking out, they may need help to improve their quality of life and wellbeing.\nSimilarly, if you’re the only one they only pay attention to and they either act terrified of other people or act as if these other people don’t exist, they may need help to expand their social circle. And if they are following you around out of boredom, that should worry you enough to add play, training, exercise, games or other enrichment to their daily experience so their life is more fulfilling.\nDogs withseparation anxietyshow a variety of behavioral and physiological responses to being left alone or even to signs that their pet parent is preparing to leave. Such responses include following behavior, drooling, peeing and pooping in the house, salivating, destructive chewing, scratching at doors and windows, howling, barking, whining, pacing, and escaping the house.\nIt can be hard to know if a dog has separation anxiety or not because so many of these occur in dogs without separation anxiety. It’s essential to consult with a veterinarian for a diagnosis because separation anxiety is a medical condition with similarities to panic disorders in people.\nGenerally speaking, dogs who display symptoms as their pet parent is getting ready to leave or within the first minutes after the departure are more likely to have separation anxiety than those who only show the above signs after hours of being alone. Boredom that leads to scratching, chewing, and vocalizing, or just really needing to pee and poop because of a medical condition or because it’s been a while can lead to the same symptoms seen in separation anxiety, so there is plenty of room for confusion.\nWhat to do when you don’t feel the close bond you want.\nHow can I get my dog to stop following me everywhere?\nNo matter how much you love your dog, having them as your constant shadow can be a challenge. It can make you feel guilty, it can affect your productivity, and it can lead to tripping and falling. (It’s happened to me, it’s happened to you, it’s happened to everyone and let’s stop pretending otherwise!) To keep everyone happy and safe, there are things you can do if you’ve ever been lying on the floor after a spill wondering, “Can someone please tell me how to get my dog to stop following me?” or asking that question at any other time.\nIt can help to keep them engaged in stimulating activities, so lots of food puzzles, things to chew on, and toys are helpful. Make sure they get enough exercise so it’s easier for them to settle because that can help, too. Train them to stay on cue and reinforce them for doing so. Training gives them practice remaining where they are even when you move around and makes it a positive experience for them.\nProvide opportunities for them to be away from you for short periods of time with something fun to do to increase their level of comfort in your absence. It’s good to know how to stop a dog from following you around because doing so often leads to a happier dog.\nHaving anolder, wiser dog around can be a big plus.\nPuppy versus adult dog following habits\nDogs of any age may follow people around, but there are many individuals who follow people around constantly as puppies, but do so far less as they get older. It’s natural for puppies to stick close to others whether it’s their mom and littermates, another dog in your home, or you.\nFollowing behavior is extremely common in young puppies, and most dogs decrease this behavior gradually as they enter adolescence and then become adults. Many adult dogs who follow people constantly are likely to become upset to some degree if they are prevented from being with us. However, in puppies, it’s often just a simple case of them wanting to be near us, but being perfectly capable of coping with short separations.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nGenerally male and female dogs are equally likely to follow you around, but female dogs in heat are especially likely to stick close to you and follow you wherever you go.\nDogs who are bred to work closely with people such as herding, retrieving, and cooperative hunting dogs are generally less independent than dogs who were bred to work on their own such as terriers and guard dogs.\nIt’s a mystery, but various theories are they are guarding us like we watch over them when they go to the bathroom, they like the smells, and they follow us because we close the bathroom door and they want to be on the same side.\nThey may be more bonded to you. You may be more attentive, at home more, play with them more often, or smell more appealing. The dog may like the treats you offer or your petting style. The dog may be intimidated by your spouse.",

  "page_content": "Frequent dog sneezing may stem from environmental factors, infections, irritants, or breed predispositions. Identifying the cause is crucial for proper treatment and your dog's overall health.\nYour dog’ssense of smellis their superpower — they use their nose to decipher the world. So it’s no surprise that, like people, they occasionally sneeze. Random sneezes aren’t necessarily something to be concerned about, but a dog sneezing a lot may be showing signs of a health condition requiring medical attention.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nUncontrolled or excessive sneezing in dogs can be caused by something as simple as pollen, household products (another reason to always usepet-safe versions), perfume,second-hand smoke, or water inhaled while swimming or during a bath. Dogs will even sometimes sneeze when they’re excited, or during play. While it’s likely that your dog’s sneezing is nothing to worry about, some dog sneezing should definitely be paid attention to and treated by a veterinarian as soon as possible.\nDon’t panic: It’s called reverse sneezing, and in most cases, it’s nothing to worry about.\nHow sneezing works\nMost of the time, sneezing is the result of transitory irritation of a dog’s nasal passages. When your dog sneezes, it’s the body’s way of dislodging or expelling the irritant. If that irritant is small, say, a stray bit of leaf, a snip of freshly cut grass, or some other small object that gets hoovered up during your dog’s investigation of their environment, a sneeze or two is usually enough to do the trick. However, that’s not always the case.\nIf your sneezing dog has nasal swelling, a persistent runny nose, nose bleeds, or is pawing at their nose, have your vet check them out without delay. Read on for the most common reasons your dog might be sneezing a lot.\nHow much sneezing is normal?\nGiving an exact number of doggy sneezes to be worried about is impossible. A few isolated sneezes throughout the day are to be expected for most dogs. Usually, you’ll be able to determine the cause pretty quickly — when they’re not sleeping, dogs often have their nose buried in something interesting. Taking a big whiff of a very strong scent, dusty area, or plant full of pollen can trigger sneezing in dogs, just like it does in people. If the sneezing stops quickly and a likely cause is apparent, the sneeze is probably normal.\nRandom sneezing events when your dog is sleeping or relaxing are harder to figure out. Generally, they’re not a big concern as long as they’re not happening frequently, and your dog is happy and symptom-free otherwise.\nWhatever triggers a sneeze will sometimes trigger a handful of sneezes in a row. Some dogs seem prone to small bouts of sneezing, while others seem to be solo sneezers. You may come to learn your dog’s normal over time and know when to expect more sneezes.\nSomething in your dog’s nasal passages that is particularly irritating or that refuses to come out easily may cause a fit of sneezing. During sneezing attacks, dogs will be alert and responsive, but have persistent bouts of sneezing for a short time. Sometimes you may be able to find something that shot out of your dog’s nose, but usually it’s just a gross misting of snot on your favorite rug. Aren’t dogs great?\n8 reasons why your dog may be sneezing\nIs your dog sneezing when excited? When your dog is having fun rollicking with their pals, they might be doing something calledplay-sneezing. Sometimes a dog will sneeze to signal to other dogs that they’re “just playing” or it’s “just a game,” and it’s completely normal. Dogs may sneeze when they’rezooming in the yard, from the sheer joy of it. Smaller dogs are more likely to do this, but it’s nothing to worry about in a dog of any size.\nThen there’sreverse sneezing, which really isn’t a sneeze at all—it’s a sneeze that sounds more like a honk. Vets call it inspiratory paroxysmal respiration, and it’s brought on by a muscle spasm at the back of a dog’s mouth, where the mouth meets the throat. The spasm narrows the airway and makes for a wheezing/honking sound during a sharp inhale. Interestingly, many of the same things that set off other sneezing fits as described in this article will also trigger reverse sneezes.\nIf your dog hassnuffled up a foxtail— a fishhook-like dried grass seed — even repeated sneezing most likely will not expel it. Foxtails are engineered to transfer from the plant to a host faster than the speed of light, embed, and then migrate, which they do in only one direction: deeper inward.\nIf your dog is unlucky enough to inhale a foxtail or other barbed grass awn, they’ll most likely sneeze like mad for a few minutes, then stop. Most of us will then think,Whew, they sneezed it out, but sometimes that’s not true. Instead, it may mean that the foxtail has already traveled further into the nasal cavity. You might even notice a tiny little drop of blood appear on the tip of the nostril.\nIt’s a good idea to leave the area, keep your dog calm and observe them closely. Unfortunately, detecting a foxtail in a dog’s nostril can be both difficult and painful, and most dogs aren’t going to let you probe around looking for it.  If you believe your dog has inhaled a foxtail, a vet visit is definitely in order. Don’t dally. The longer you wait, the more challenging (and costly) removing the foxtail will be. Even if it turns out not to be a foxtail, knowing that for sure is worth the cost of the visit.\nJust like us, a dog can haveseasonal allergies. Plant or grass pollen, dust mites, and certain household chemicals are the most common culprits for allergy-related dog sneezing. Dogs who have allergies may be more prone to skin and ear infections as well. Talk with your vet about the best ways to treat these allergies.\nFrequent sneezing sometimes signals an infection caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi. Viruses (includingdistemperandparainfluenza) can cause a dog to sneeze due to increased nasal discharge.Bordetellais one of the bacteria that causes kennel cough, which can be accompanied by sneezing.Aspergillosisis a common nasal infection caused by inhalation ofAspergillusfungus, which is basically everywhere. Other inhaled fungi, such asCryptococcusandBlastomyces, also affect a dog’s respiratory system and could cause sneezing.\nIn rare cases, persistent sneezing can be caused by nasal mites. These tiny insects, about only one millimeter in size, can be found in dirt, and dogs who dig with their noses may contract them this way. These mites, which can be very irritating to dogs, are contagious and require treatment. Your veterinarian may prescribe topical or oral medication to eliminate and prevent nasal mites.\nA cancerous tumor in a dog’s nasal passage is sometimes the cause of excessive sneezing. Nasal cancer makes up 1 to 2 percent of cancers in dogs and has an 80 percent malignancy rate. While, like most cancers, there’s no known single cause, it’s thought that this cancer has both environmental (second-hand cigarette smoke, for example) and genetic origins.\nLonger-snouted breeds like Collies and Dachshunds are the most susceptible. In addition to sneezing, symptoms of nasal tumors include difficulty breathing, noisy breathing, bloody nasal discharge, coughing, loud snoring, seizures, and facial swelling. Needless to say, if your dog exhibits some or most of these symptoms, they should be checked out by your vet ASAP.\nWhile it may not seem like an obvious cause, canine dental problems such as infected teeth and abscesses can create an infection that travels to the nasal cavities, causing a runny nose and sneezing.\nVeterinarians must do more to discourage the breeding of animals with conditions known to seriously compromise their welfare.\nBreeds prone to sneezing\nThere are also structural reasons for some dogs’ snorting and sneezing. The nasal passages ofbrachycephalic breeds— short-muzzled types like Bulldogs, Pugs, and Boston Terriers — are compressed, which leads to a fair amount of sneezing, snoring, and snorting. In fact, dogs of these breeds can have a condition known as brachycephalic airway obstruction syndrome (BAOS); sneezing is one of the symptoms associated with BAOS.\nWhen should you contact your vet for excessive sneezing?\nContact your vet if your dog has a sudden uptick in frequency of sneezing, a sneezing fit that won’t stop, or if you are concerned about your dog’s sneezing for any reason. Also alert your vet if your dog’s sneezing is accompanied by symptoms like:\nBloody, yellowish, or greenish nasal discharge\nBloody, yellowish, or greenish nasal discharge\nLoud or labored breathing\nLoud or labored breathing\nFever\nFever\nLoss of appetite\nLoss of appetite\nCoughing\nCoughing\nLethargy\nLethargy\nVomiting\nVomiting\nFacial swelling\nFacial swelling\nPain\nPain\nYour vet can help to assess your dog’s overall health and give recommendations for care or work-up for the sneezing. Most causes of sneezing are benign, but it’s better to be safe and get things checked out if something feels off about your dog’s sneezing.\nHere’s what works (and what doesn’t).\nFAQs (People also ask):\nNo one knows for sure why dogs sneeze when they play or get excited. It may be one of many signals to playmates that chasing each other or play-fighting is just a game and that there is no threat intended.\nAs for a regular sneeze, an occasional bout of reverse sneezing is not a big concern. Frequent or persistent bouts of reverse sneezing should be checked out by your vet to make sure there’s nothing in the back of your dog’s throat causing irritation.\nSome dogs do seem to sneeze more when they’re playing, happy, or excited. The cause for this is unknown but could be part of behavioral signaling. It could also be due to blood vessels in the nose dilating due to excitement and excreting extra fluid.\nReferences:\nMerck Veterinary Manual: Nasal Mites\nMerck Veterinary Manual: Nasal Mites\nInterclinician Agreement on the Recognition of selected Respiratory Clinical Signs in Dogs and Cats with Abnormal Breathing Patterns\nInterclinician Agreement on the Recognition of selected Respiratory Clinical Signs in Dogs and Cats with Abnormal Breathing Patterns",

  "page_content": "There’s nothing cuter than dogs frolicking out in the great wide open, running at full speed with their tongues hanging out in what looks like anear-to-ear grin. And while we love and expect dogs to pant while they are running around, you may be wondering why your dog seems to be panting at other random times.\nRead on to learn all about why dogs pant and when to be concerned.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat is panting?\nPanting is a breathing technique that dogs typically use to cool off. A panting dog will have their mouth open, usually with their tongue hanging out, and will be taking frequent, shallow breaths. This is done to quickly move air over the moist surfaces of their respiratory tract, which allows them to cool down.\nPanting is the only mechanism dogs have to cool off since they do not sweat like we do. This is why you will often see your dog panting if it is hot out and/or if they are exercising.\nDon’t panic, but definitely talk to your vet if you’re worried about any of these conditions.\nWhy do dogs pant?\nThe main reason that dogs pant is to cool off; however, sometimes dogs will also pant for reasons that are unrelated to cooling down. The main reasons dogs will pant include:\nPanting is the main way that dogs can cool off so they will often pant as soon as their body temperature starts to climb.\nPhysical exercise of any kind,including running, climbing stairs, and wrestling with other dogs can lead dogs to exert themselves. As they exercise, their body temperature rises, and they exert more energy, so they pant to cool down.\nDogs will also pant in certain emotional situations such as when they are excited,stressed, scared, or nervous. In these cases, they do not actually need to cool off, but this is more of a psychological reaction and may be accompanied by an elevated heart rate and respiratory rate.\nDogs often pant when they arein pain. This is partially a behavioral response. Pain can also cause physical changes like an elevated heart rate and respiratory rate, which in turn can lead dogs to pant.\nCertain disease processes can also make dogs more likely to pant. This includes any condition where a dog has a fever, as well as conditions that cause an increase in steroid hormones, such asCushing’s disease.\nCertain medications, including sedatives, steroids, and pain medications, can cause dogs to pant as well.\nDogs who are having difficulty breathing may pant or breathe with their mouths open; however, this is not always the case. Other signs of a breathing problem include loud breath noises, rapid breathing, bluish gums and tongue, and/or increased effort to take a breath. Any of these signs are considered medical emergencies.\nHow much panting is abnormal?\nIt can be difficult to judge how much panting is abnormal in many cases, because this can differ from one dog to the next. Because panting has a very important purpose for dogs, as long as they are panting at appropriate times, and without any other signs of breathing difficulty or other health problems, it can be normal. This is especially true if they are panting for an obvious reason, such as on a hot day or after exercise.\nAs long as they stop panting after a reasonable amount of time and are able to settle down, that is most likely a normal response. But it is also important to take heavy panting as a sign that your dog is exerting themself to the max; if you are out for a walk on a hot day, and they are panting hard, that is a sign that they are getting too hot and need to get to a cool spot to rest and have some water.\nThe same goes for exercise; if your dog is panting heavily and can’t catch their breath,they need a break. If you provide them with rest, a cool place to rest and some water and they still continue to pant heavily, this can be a sign of overheating, and you should get to a vet right away.\nReasons for excessive panting\nExcessive panting can occur for many different reasons, so it’s important to look for patterns as to when and where your dog is panting and report these patterns to your vet. A dog who is panting excessively should have a full veterinary work-up to look for underlying medical causes including:\nThe most common reason for a dog to pant excessively is due to overheating. This would be especially likely in hot weather, or after intense exercise. Some dogs may have underlying medical problems that lead them to overheat more easily,including obesity, respiratory problems, and smushed-face breeds known asbrachycephalics, so they may exhibit these signs even when it doesn’t feel that hot out for us. Overheating can lead to life-threateningheat strokeso any dog who does not seem to cool off quickly once in a cool place needs to see a veterinarian immediately.\nPain is another reason dogs may pant, especially if they are at rest, in a cool space. Pain may be obvious if your dog has a sudden injury. In other cases, dogs may be very stoic and not show clear signs of pain. This is especially common with more chronic forms of pain,such as arthritis.\nDogs with respiratory disease don’t always pant, but some might, especially if their underlying respiratory disease makes them overheat. Other common signs of respiratory disease include getting tired quickly, breathing fast, using more effort to take a breath, a blue tinge to the gums and tongue,coughing, collapse, and/or loud breathing noises. All of these signs indicate amedical emergency.\nHeart diseaseand respiratory disease are often interconnected, so dogs with heart disease may have difficulty breathing, too. Not every dog with heart disease will pant, but some might. They may also show signs similar to a dog with respiratory disease including getting tired quickly, breathing fast, using more effort to take a breath, a blue tinge to the gums and tongue, coughing, collapse, and/or loud breathing noises.\nExcessive panting is caused by many reasons, including emotional reasons including excitement, anxiety, fear, or stress. If your dog has other signs of a behavioral condition, this may be the reason for their panting, but it’s important to have a full medical work-up first to rule out any of the more serious health problems. If your dog seems to pant excessively and has other signs of anxiety or fear, get them help and relief from these feelings. This may involve both behavioral-modification training as well as medications.\nSeven reasons to be concerned when your dog is coughing.\nWhen to contact a vet about excessive panting\nIf you believe your dog is panting excessively, always contact your vet. It is important to check for serious medical problems that could be causing them to pant so much and get your dog relief, if needed. Even if you believe your dog is panting due to behavioral reasons, there are ways to help them feel better and avoid those intense feelings.Finally, if your dog has any other signs of illness or pain, including decreased appetite, vomiting or diarrhea, lethargy, breathing fast, using more effort to take a breath, a blue tinge to the gums and tongue, coughing, collapse, and/or loud breathing noises, these are all signs of a more serious problem and should be checked out right away.\nHow is excessive panting in dogs treated?\nExcessive panting does not need to be treated directly, but rather, the underlying causes leading to the panting need to be diagnosed and treated. Your vet will perform a thorough physical exam as well as additional tests like bloodwork and X-rays in order to help determine the cause of your dog’s panting.\nBased on these findings, your vet will treat any underlying medical problems that are discovered. If your dog is panting due to overheating, they will need to be actively cooled and given supportive care like intravenous fluids to help stabilize them. In extreme cases of heat stroke, dogs often need intensive care in the hospital to get them through the most serious complications.\nOther conditions that may lead to panting like pain, fevers, respiratory disease, or heart disease are treated specifically based on the diagnosis. More serious conditions, especially those related to breathing often require hospitalization and more intensive support. Your vet will council you on the best course of action for your dog’s specific condition.\nAs scorching, long-lasting temperatures become the new normal, here’s how to help keep your pets cool and healthy.\nHow to manage panting at home\nIf you are concerned that your dog is panting excessively, especially if they also have other signs of illness or distress, head to the vet right away and don’t try to manage this issue at home. The more serious causes for excessive panting are true medical emergencies and early intervention could save your pup’s life. In cases where your dog is panting but acting fine otherwise, you should focus on keeping your dog cool and calm. Because overheating is a common cause for panting, be sure to give your dog a nice cool place to hang out that is quiet and has access to water.\nIf your dog was just out in the heat or just finished exercising, you can actively cool them down by wetting their fur with cool or room-temperature water and aiming a fan at them. If they are panting due to fear, anxiety or stress, try to find a quiet safe space for them away from any stimulation where they can settle down. If you have apheromone diffuseror spray, you can bring that into the quiet space to help soothe your dog, too. If they do not respond to these measures and continues to pant excessively or develop any other concerning signs, head to the vet.\nIf you have already been to the vet and know your dog always pants excessively in certain situations, speak with your vet about long-term strategies to manage this. For behavioral causes, you canwork with a behavioristto implement a training plan to help them cope with scary or overwhelming situations. For some dogs, a combination of training andmedication is most effectiveto bring them relief. That way, if you can anticipate stressful situations like fireworks, travel, or whatever triggers your pup, you can be proactive in your approach and avoid a crisis.\nTemperatures are rising dangerously. Keep your pet safe with these tips.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nBreathing heavily without panting can be a sign of a respiratory problem, a heart problem, or other serious illness. Any dog breathing heavily needs to get to a vet right away.\nIn general, there are no gender differences regarding panting levels. Female dogs will pant more if they are in advanced pregnancy, however.\nAt rest, a dog’s respiratory rate should be less than 20 breaths per minute, with sleeping dogs closer to eight to 12 breaths per minute. If your dog is breathing more quickly and/or has other signs of distress such as getting tired quickly, using more effort to take a breath, a blue tinge to the gums and tongue, coughing, collapse, and/or loud breathing noises, these are all cause for concern.\nReferences:\nAnimal Medical Center: Heatstroke\nAnimal Medical Center: Heatstroke\nMerck Veterinary Manual: Introduction to Lung and Airway Disorders of Dogs\nMerck Veterinary Manual: Introduction to Lung and Airway Disorders of Dogs\nResearch in Veterinary Science: Sleeping Respiratory Rates in Apparently Healthy Adult Dogs\nResearch in Veterinary Science: Sleeping Respiratory Rates in Apparently Healthy Adult Dogs\nRespiration Physiology: Panting in dogs: Paths of Air Flow in Response to Heat and Exercise\nRespiration Physiology: Panting in dogs: Paths of Air Flow in Response to Heat and Exercise",

Your pup’s intense gaze might hold a deeper meaning beyond mere admiration. Dogs communicate primarily through body language and eye contact is a significant part of their social interactions. When your dog locks eyes with you, they might be attempting to convey a message or understand your intentions.\nDecoding the various motivations behind your dog’s unwavering stare can provide valuable insight into their behavior andstrengthen your bond. From trying to read your emotional cues to simply seeking affection, let’s uncover the potential reasons your dog stares at you and what you can do to turn their attention elsewhere.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nPossible reasons for dog staring\nYour canine companion’s unyielding gaze may hold deeper meanings than meets the eye. Indeed, dog stares are not merely superficial; they can convey a wide range of emotions and intentions“Some suggest that dog stares signify affection and adoration towards their pet parents,” says Aaron Rice,dog trainer at Stayyy. “On the other hand, it can also be a polite request for attention, food, or a walk.”\nHere are some possible motivations behind your dog’s persistent stare.\nDogs are incredibly attuned to human body language and facial expressions. They may stare at you intently to gauge your mood or emotional state, helping them better understand how to respond or interact with you.\nYour dog’s gaze might simply be a polite yet awkward way of asking you to pay attention to them. Whether they’re craving a belly rub, a walk, or just some quality time together, dogs often use eye contact as a subtle way to communicate their desires and needs.\nDogs are pros at expressing love and affection, and one way they do this is through prolonged eye contact. When your canine companion stares at you with those big, soulful eyes, it could simply be their way of telling youthey love you.\nSometimes a dog’s stare isn’t about seeking attention or showing affection; it’s about expressing confusion or concern. If your dog seems to be staring at you with a furrowed brow or a quizzical expression, they may be trying to make sense of something they find puzzling or worrisome. It could be a new environment, a strange noise, or even your own behavior that has them feeling uneasy.\nIf you’re approaching your dog and they stare at you intensely, it may mean they don’t want to interact. This will typically also be accompanied by a stiff posture,pulled back ears, and potentially a growl. In this case, it’s important to stop your approach and ensure you’re not making them feel uncomfortable. Continuing forwardcould result in aggressionor other unwanted behavior.\nThe connection between people and dogs is the stuff of legend.\nHow to figure out why your dog is staring\nYou’re probably itching to understand exactly why your dog’s eyes are locked on you — because one, maybe they need something, and two, it’s starting to get a little weird. The key to figuring this out lies in understanding dog body language.\n“Some pet parents may become concerned when their dog’s staring persists, even when their needs are fulfilled,” Rice says. “In such cases, observing their behavior is essential to figure out the underlying cause. While decoding your dog’s behavior may be challenging, some simple body language cues can tell you a lot.”\nFirst, take note of their overall posture and any accompanying behaviors. For example, if your dog’s body is relaxed, their tail is wagging, and they occasionally glance away from you, it’s likely that they’re seeking attention or affection. On the other hand, if they’restanding stifflywith theirears pinned backand their body tense, they might be feeling anxious or uncertain.\nAnother important clue to pay attention to is the intensity of your dog’s gaze. A soft, relaxed gaze accompanied by a gentle wag of the tail typically indicates feelings of love and contentment. But if your dog’s stare is intense and unyielding, it could suggest that they’re feeling stressed, threatened, or even on high alert. By observing these subtle cues in your dog’s body language, you can gain a better understanding of their emotional state and the motivation behind their prolonged stare.\nStaring can be a normal behavior in dogs, just like it is in humans (admit it, you do it, too). Most of the time, they’re just doing it to communicate emotions, needs, or desires. But there are also situations where it might indicate an underlying issue. The context and duration of the stare are key in determining whether it’s within the realm of typical behavior or if it warrants taking a closer look.\nThe point where it could signal something more serious is when your dog’s staring becomes incessant, intense, or accompanied by other concerning behaviors. If your pup’s gaze feels unsettlingly persistent or if they seem to be staring at you with an air of anxiety, aggression, or distress, it’s worth a chat with a veterinarian or animal behaviorist. Any sudden change in your dog’s overall demeanor is worth looking into, staring included.\nAs endearing as it may be to have your dog’sundivided attention, there comes a time when you might crave a little space from their intense gaze. But how do you gently nudge your dog to redirect their attention elsewhere? There are a few things you can do:\nDistraction with treats or toys:When your dog fixates on you with an intense stare, redirect their attention by offering them a tasty treat or engaging them with their favorite toy. This helps shift their focus away from staring and encourages them to engage in something else.\nDistraction with treats or toys:When your dog fixates on you with an intense stare, redirect their attention by offering them a tasty treat or engaging them with their favorite toy.

It could be a sign of affection, an attempt to communicate a need or desire, or simply a display of attention. Additionally, dogs have different blinking patterns than humans, and they may not blink as frequently, especially when focused or observing something intently.\nDogs could stay at your while you sleep for multiple reasons. It could be a sign of affection, as they may enjoy watching over their pet parent during moments of vulnerability. It could also indicate a desire for attention, especially if the dog is accustomed to receiving interaction or companionship throughout the day.\nDogs staring at their pet parents while pooping is a behavior that can stem from their instinctual need for security and protection. In the wild, dogs are vulnerable during elimination, so they may look to their pack leader (in this case, you) for reassurance and protection. Dogs are also highly attuned to human body language and may seek visual cues from their pet parents for comfort or security, even during routine activities like bathroom breaks.\nDogs may follow their pet parents everywhere for a variety of reasons, including seeking companionship, expressing affection, or simply out of curiosity. Dogs are social animals who thrive on human interaction and may feel more secure when they are in close proximity to their humans. Dogs may also follow their pet parents as a way to monitor their activities, seek attention, or explore their environment.\nReferences:\nDog Body Language Basics",

  "page_content": "If you’re among the45 percent of Americanswho believe in the paranormal, you may feel a little freaked out when your dog stares at the wall or barks at seemingly nothing. Could a ghost be drifting through your home? Can dogs see ghosts in your house? Oris your pup just a weirdo?\nThe short answer is no one knows. Science is as uncertain about the existence of spirits and specters as it is about whether animals like dogs have a connection to the other side. But so much ofcanine personalityand behavior is unexplained that a dog seeing a ghost isn’t entirely out of the question. Maybe these spooky moments aren’t just the stuff of scary movies.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nYour pup doesn’t actually feel bad about eating your pizza.\nDogs’ enhanced senses compared to humans\nSo, can dogs see ghosts or spirits? Dogs are more perceptive than humans in many ways, with morepowerful senses of smelland hearing, as well as stronger night vision. They’re even more attuned to environmental changes and have been known to detect impending natural disasters before they actually happen.\nBecause of theirincredible sense of smell, dogs can sniff out shifts in barometric pressure and other odors associated with natural events. Some dogs have also beentrained to detect canceror predict seizures, putting their strong sense of smell to use to detect changes that humans can’t perceive.\nDogs also have a powerful sense of hearing andcan hear higher frequenciesthan humans — about four times what the human ear can detect. They can even hear higher-pitched noises from much farther away, so if your dog suddenly barks, they may be reacting to a noise you can’t hear.While dogs are near-sighted (andalso colorblind), their field of vision is wider than that of humans, and they are particularly adept at seeing in low light, like dusk, twilight, and dawn. Because of their strong vision, dogs may be able to see things we can’t, whether that is, in fact, a ghost, or just a squirrel sneaking around the far side of the yard.\nA new study says your dog could fall into one of these categories based on their reactions to real-life events.\nReal-life dog reactions to “unseen” entities\nCan dogs see ghosts and spirits? Many pet parents have experienced situations where their dog reacts negatively to something unseen. This can include barking, whining, or even demonstrating anxious orfearful behavior. Some dogs may stare down an empty hallway or at a wall or a spot on the ceiling, while others may be drawn to or avoid certain areas in the house.\nDogs tend to be more demonstrative with their reactions and emotions, so even if your dog hears, smells, or sees something benign, their physical reaction may be big — and even startling. And your dog could just be anxious, quick to react to any noise they hear.\nScientific research on dog “sixth sense”\nCan dogs really see ghosts? What the science says is uncertain, both about dogs’ perception of the paranormal and the existence of ghosts in general.\nDogs do have a “sixth sense” of sorts, which could also be described as instinct or perceptiveness. This means that they are often quicker than humans to tell when something is off. There are plenty of stories of dogs detecting medical emergencies before their human parents realized the issue. Plus, dogs are more likely to act on these gut feelings, paying close attention to the cues from their heightened senses and acting in response. And like many animals,dogs have an internal compassthat helps with their sense of direction.\nWhen they’re “ghost-walking” outside of Halloween, they could have trance-like syndrome, or TLS.\nTheories about dogs’ paranormal perceptions\nHow can dogs see ghosts (if there are ghosts to see)? If something supernatural is going on, dogs would be more likely to notice than us. But it’s far more likely that a dog barking or staring at nothing is sensing something that you don’t. Dogs can pick up scents that were left behind hours or even days ago or may hear animals outside that are some distance away — and beyond human hearing. Many dogs are even able to read human emotions, so if you act frightened or anxious, it may trigger your dog to have a similar response.\nAnother, more concerning potential reason for a dog’s reaction to unseen stimuli could be an illness or health condition. Just like humans, as dogs age, their senses grow weaker, and their behaviors may change. Some dogs experience adegenerative disorder similar to dementiaor Alzheimer’s that can cause restlessness, pacing, or even staring off into space.\nA dog triggered by things you don’t see could also be suffering from an anxiety disorder or a more unique condition likeLaser Pointer Syndrome(yes, that’s a thing). In short, any number of things could reach your dog’s senses that you don’t perceive, whether paranormal or not.\nA fascination with lights and shadows is common in high-energy dogs — but it can develop into obsessive-compulsive disorder if it gets out of hand.\nBreeds with enhanced senses\nAlthough the question “can cats and dogs see ghosts?” is impossible to answer, some dogs do have particularly powerful senses. While all dogs have stronger senses than humans, some breeds are even more attuned to smells, sounds, and sights. Dog breeds that were originally bred for working or hunting often have more keener senses. Pointers, Labrador Retrievers, German Shepherds, Beagles, and any type of Hound are more likely to react to stimuli that their human parents don’t see or hear because these dog’s senses tend to be especially powerful.\nDebunking other theories\nIf you believe in ghosts, you’re more likely to project that idea onto your pet’s unusual behavior, but dog’s heightened senses allow them to perceive things that humans simply can’t. When your dog halts and their fur stands on end, they may be reacting to a high-pitched or distant sound that you’re unable to hear. And if they seem especially drawn to a room or piece of furniture where a lost loved one used to spend time, they could be detecting old smells that have faded beyond a human’s ability to recognize.\nWhat’s behind the desire and whether it’s safe to do.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nScience is out on whether ghosts even exist or whether dogs can see paranormal entities.\nIf there are ghosts to see, dogs would be more likely to perceive them because of their stronger senses of sight, hearing, and smell, as well as their ability to pick up on changes in the atmosphere.\nWhen a dog spends a lot of time with a human, they may become attuned to that person’s negative emotions and pick up on them easily. “Negative energy” could be related to a sound or smell that dogs detect and react to.\nReferences:\nOlfaction and Dog Welfare\nOlfaction and Dog Welfare\nExistence of Ghosts and Paranormal Entities (Overview on Negative Energy)\nExistence of Ghosts and Paranormal Entities (Overview on Negative Energy)\nHow Well Do Dogs and Other Animals Hear?\nHow Well Do Dogs and Other Animals Hear?\nDo Dogs Have a Sixth Sense?

    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/dogs-do-not-feel-guilt"
  },
  "page_content": "In J. R. Ackerley’s 1956 classicMy Dog Tulip, the author writes about what appears to be a display of guilt from his beloved dog, Tulip, after she accidentally bites him. “We all make mistakes and she was dreadfully sorry,” Ackerley writes. “She rolled over on the grass with all her legs in the air; and later on, when she saw the bandage on my hand, she put herself in the corner, the darkest corner of the bedroom, and stayed there for the rest of the afternoon. One can't do more than that.”\nIt’s a touching sentiment, and speaks to the bond Ackerley had with his cherished friend. But is it also, um … a completely inaccurate reading of Tulip’s behavioral cues? Research shows that despite their remorseful looks, and despite what all of those “dog shaming” videos on social media might claim to display, it is unlikely your dog feels guilt after doing something wrong. So, what are our dogs actually trying to tell us?\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nBut hold on a second, my dog reallydoeslook guilty sometimes.\nIt’s easy to understand why pet parents believe their dogs feel guilty after doing something they shouldn’t. In videos acrossYouTube,Instagram, andTikTok, humans capture their allegedly guilty dogs averting their eyes, cowering, hiding, thumping their tails nervously; basically, they behave a bit like guilty humans might.\nTo understand why it’s unlikely that, for example, your dog knows they shouldn’t have eaten some of your delicious pizza and now feels shame for having done it, it’s helpful to first know the difference between primary and secondary emotions. “Primary emotions are often thought of as non-learned reactions that are automatically triggered by external or internal cues and are considered to have a long evolutionary history,”Dr. Ljerka Ostojić, a researcher and professor at the University of Rijeka in Croatia, who has studied the perception of guilt in dogs, tells Kinship. These are things like happiness, sadness, and fear, and they have been empirically observed in dogs.\nSecondary emotions, Ostojić says, require cognitive appraisal of a situation; they’re “thought of as more complex and are considered to involve some form of evaluation, likely following an experience of a primary emotion.” Science so far suggests that dogs do not experience secondary emotions. Guilt, which requires self awareness and is often influenced by societal norms, falls under this umbrella. (Though the belief that dogs feel some secondary emotions is not without debate — jealousy is a secondary emotion, for example, and there is some research that suggestsdogs do experience it.)\nA new study says your dog could fall into one of these categories based on their reactions to real-life events.\n“Many researchers interpret the ascription of guilt to dogs as anthropomorphism,” Ostojić says; that is, the human tendency to ascribe their own human emotional experience in a given situation to a nonhuman animal or object. She siteda 2015 studyfrom Christina Brown and Julia McLean that found participants who reported higher levels of feeling guilt themselves were more prone than other participants to interpret their dog’s behaviors after a misdeed as being an indicator of the dog’s guilt.\n“I certainly love talking about emotions,” Julie Hecht, an animal behavior researcher, tells Kinship. “It just seems like this one-to-one attribution — that is, ‘I know this is how I would feel and behave, and oh my gosh, my dog is giving me so many clues that we are the same’ — the research does not seem to back it up.” Hecht says these seemingly guilty actions are more in line with appeasement displays, which are behaviors used by social animals to reduce conflict and lessen punishment. Rather than guilt, your dog could be feeling fear.\nResearch shows seemingly guilty behaviors are more about human influence.\nAlexandra Horowitz, director of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, published a study in 2009 which observed canine behavior after being scolded. In the study, human participants were instructed to tell their dogs not to eat a particular treat. Then, the humans left the room and the dogs were either given the treat, or the treat was taken away.\nThe humans returned and were told, despite what had actually happened, that their dogs either did or did not eat the treat. The humans who thought their dogs had eaten the treat scolded them, prompting guilty behavior. The trouble is, the guilty behavior that came after a scolding was more prevalent in dogs who hadnotactually eaten the treat. This shows a lack of connection between knowledge of a misdeed and guilty behavior, and a greater connection between that behavior and human cues (which can be far more subtle than scolding).\nOstojić and Hecht have each co-authored subsequent studies attempting to further discern the relationship between human cues and seemingly guilty canine behavior. Hecht’s2012 studytested the theory that some dogs display guilty behaviors before scolding begins, as some humans report they only learn about certain misdeeds because of their dogs’ guilty displays.\nAfter giving dogs the opportunity to break a rule by eating “human” food from a table in their human’s absence, they found that dogs who did eat the food were not more likely to look guilty upon their human’s return than dogs who didn’t. Additionally, they found humans did not have a greater-than-chance ability to determine, based on their dog’s behavior (in the absence of scolding), whether or not they had committed the infraction.\nThis doesn’t rule out the idea that guilty behavior can precede scolding, but it does suggest that, when it does, the guilty behavior may simply be a result of a dog connecting past punishment with present environmental cues. Inan article for Scientific American, Hecht cited a 1970s paper from a veterinarian who sought to test this theory. The veterinarian studied a dog who was shredding paper when left alone. He instructed the dog’s human parent to shred paper, leave the dog alone, and then return. Even though the dog hadn’t shred the paper herself, she still acted guilty upon her human’s return, suggesting that she connected the presence of shredded paper with imminent punishment.\nYour personality may actually have something to do with your pet’s personality.\nOstojić’s2015 studytested whether dogs would show a \"guilty look\" even when they were not scolded. They tested this by giving some dogs forbidden food in the absence of their guardian, and making it either visible or hidden when the human came back. The results showed that the dogs' behavior didn't change based on whether or not they ate the food, or whether it was visible or not. The study also showed the owners couldn't accurately tell if their dog had eaten the food based on the dog's greeting behavior. Like the other similar studies, the researchers’ findings did not support the idea that the “guilty” look occurs in dogs without a human cue.\nIt is harmful to believe your dog feels guilt.\nBelieving your dog can feel guilt can be helpful to a species (human) that often feels most comfortable having someone to blame when something goes wrong. If your dog knew they were doing something they shouldn’t, and that idea is reinforced by guilty behavior, then they are at fault and the resulting punishment is deserved and well-taken. On the other side, believing that they feel guilt can also feel a bit like giving your dog love and empathy, and treating their feelings with respect.\nBut it isn’t in a dog’s best interest tomisunderstand them. In assuming guilt and knowledge of a misdeed, the human excuses themselves from looking into and addressing the root cause of a certain behaviors — be it nervousness, fear, pain, or something else altogether. Hecht says it can lead to the false idea that you and your dog are on the same page, but because you are not, the behavior will continue or even worsen. “For some, depending on so many factors — like what the dog did wrong,” Hecht says, “it might deteriorate the relationship, because the person is not in any way addressing that underlying action.”\nWhen dogs are presumed to know what they’ve done wrong, they aren’t being given the tools to understand how they are expected to behave. If their behavior comes with punishment, they’ve only being given the information that they should simultaneously feel afraid. Like allfear-based training, this is not shown to facilitate long term behavioral change, and can cause harm.\nEven if a pet parent thinks the researchers have it wrong, and that their dogcanfeel guilt and learn through that feeling, Ostojić wonders why one would want to allow them to feel those negative emotions, rather than give them the tools to avoid the behavior altogether. “The end question is whether they want to put their dog into a situation in which they are experiencing the negative emotion (whether it is a response to [the human’s] own behavior or an expression of guilt),” she says. “The answer here I hope is a ‘no.’”\nFor the same reason, she says, she and other researchers in this area have an ethical responsibility to actively discourage pet parents from provoking dogs to exhibit these “guilty” behaviors, “which is commonly done for videos that are then shared across social media platforms.” When doing this, even though it might get a laugh, you’re unnecessarily making your dog experience a negative emotion; whether it be guilt or fear.\n“It’s hard to be a dog,” Hecht says, “but they're also very tolerant of us and our shortcomings. This, I would say, is one of our shortcomings.”",

  "page_content": "Last year, my husband and I adopted a small Terrier. Upon meeting her one dry April day, the name was obvious: Bonnie. She was so clearly and perfectly Bonnie.\nI wish that was the end of the story, but the name Bonnie presented an issue. We concluded Bonnie sounded a little too similar to her cousin’s name, Bobbie, and could be confusing at family events, so we tried different names in the first 72 hours she was under our care. We worried over this name. We wrung our hands over it. We discussed alternatives for days. Nothing we could come up with sounded quite as correct as Bonnie.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nSo it’s especially perplexing that at some point within six months of raising this puppy, Bonnie had become Barney. Then Barney became Barney Mcgillicutty. ThenBarney Rubble Trouble. Soon, Barney morphed into Barneth, or, formally — like if you wanted to address a wedding invitation to her — Barneth K. Abernathy. Sometimes she’s Barnyard; other times, she’s Bernice. Occasionally, depending on the day, the company, and her personality in that moment, she’s Bonchan, Cinnabon, Miss Priss, Little One, Little Rat, or Pig. My mother calls her Bonbon, which I think is strange. What kind of nickname is Bonbon?\nAt this point, besides a full-stop lobotomy, I don’t think there’s anything that can help my me and my husband. But occasionally, I wonder if we’re confusing the girl. Bonnie is very smart, and listens to us. When we make our demands of her, we try to use her given name to avoid any confusion, but we slip up a lot. What, I wondered, are all these names doing to my poor dog?\nWhat’s in a name?\nBefore we can articulate how the wrong name affects a dog, we have to establish the reason we give our dogs names in the first place. Dina Casellini, founder, owner, and principal trainer ofMindfulPupsin Brooklyn, New York, told me that names aren’t completely necessary to communicate with our pups.\nYour dog might not know your name. Don’t take offense; just play this game.\n“Some trainers just use commands,” Casellini says. “They don’t necessarily use the name.”\nYet, naming is a natural human impulse, and can be a useful one. Teaching a dog their name alsoteaches them to pay attention to you, Casellini adds, so you can carry out other cues. It’s among thefirst building blocks ofdog training. A dog’s name usually cues, “Eyes and ears on me.”\nWhen to call them by their name\nGiving a dog a good name foundation while training is especially essential for one very specific reason: emergency situations. In case of emergency, Casellini explains, you want the dog to have an immediate response to their name so you can quickly call them away from dangerous circumstances.\n“When it comes to any of the life-saving skills, we really want to make sure that we practice with clarity,” Casellini says. She recommends using the exact same name, command, and tone each time.\n“You have to rehearse multiple times, not just wait until the emergency moment to call upon that practice,” Casellini adds.\nLikewise, in a group-training space or multi-dog households, naming becomes a more crucial piece of the communication puzzle. “If we open the door, and we don't want six dogs to run through at the same time, we will ask the dogs to wait, we will open the door, and then we will call the designated dog [by name],” Casellini says.\nShe advises against naming dogs in a single household similar names to avoid confusion, but it’s not an insurmountable obstacle if a Bonnie and a Bobbie, for example, shared living space. In the event that she has, say, three “Lunas” in a class, she uses eye contact and body language to communicate which Luna she’s talking to.\nAlana Stevenson, a dog and cat behaviorist whotrains dogs across New England, likewise suggests avoiding similar-sounding names.\nSay What? A look at the types of words that dogs understand.\n“Most non-human animals have a sense of hearing that is far superior to ours,” Stevenson says. “Dogs with nearly identical names may eventually learn the nuances in your voice to differentiate between themselves, but when strangers or others say their names, they won’t have that same familiarity.” He purposely picks names that do not sound similar when he's choosing names for animals. “For multiple dogs, I pick a ‘group’ name to call all dogs and teach that to my clients,” he says.\nIt’s as much how you say it as what you say\nResearchers have begun to explore so-called “genius” dogs for whom language acquisition comes more naturally than others. Arecent studyshowed that some dogs are capable of learning words for their toys through a vocabulary acquisition test (VAT). While the study was not able to establish whether this was a product ofnature or nurture, the thing to remember is that there are dogs who are capable of learning names for various toys, commands, etc., and that bodes well for dog’s apprehending their various nicknames. Still, for most dogs, the accepted wisdom is that when you’re communicating with them, tone and body language matter as much, if not more, than a word itself.\nAs Stevenson puts it, “Most animals become comfortable with tones, noises, and sounds, not necessarily the word itself. So, if another person said the same word, most animals wouldn’t associate with it. Likewise, if someone is constantly yelling at the animal, repeating the animal's name over and over again as replacement for any interactions or redirections, then the animal will ignore what the person is saying.”\nIf you tend to recall a dog by saying their name in a high-pitched voice and clap, then they will infer that you want them to come. If you use the same tone and body language to call a dog who is officially named “Charlie,” let’s say, but shout, “Pizza,” or “Donkey,” or “Tony Soprano,” then Charlie will often still respond to the context clues you’ve offered.\nThink of a dog’s speech acquisition like your own. If you’re in a country where you don’t speak the language well, you’re going to learn to recognize a few words and pay more attention to body language than you would if you’re totally fluent.\nNickname to your heart’s content in most situations\nCassenili adds that a lot of what we say is just “white noise” to our pets. In training, usually the fewer words you use, including nicknames, the better. But outside of training, it matters less because they’re likely not paying that close attention to your literal words.\n“It’s a human thing to make nicknames. It’s fun,” Casenelli says. “We love to have fun with our dogs.” Outside of emergency situations, it’s fine to call a pup whatever comes to mind. “If [you’re] just giving cuddles from the other room, you can say whatever you want.”\nIn those moments, the pups probably won’t be confused. In fact, Bonnie-Barney-Bernice-Bonatron-Barneth-Cinnebon-Bonbon probably won’t register her nickname(s) at all.",

  "page_content": "If we learn anything as we age out of the desire to leave the house after 10 p.m. or have a friend force last-minute plans upon us, it’s that being a grouch isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In short, embrace the crankiness — wisdom some of our pets have long been enjoying. In fact, in 2021, one study found that the grumpiest pups among us may also be the smartest.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nThe Hungarian studyexamined how quickly dogs can learn based on their temperament. “People usually look at the different behaviors of dogs as completely separate phenomena and handle them as such. While I think it is important to be able to identify behaviors separately, it is as important to see their connections,” says biologist and one of the study’s authors Kata Vékony.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nBefore starting the experiment, researchers issued a questionnaire to participating pet parents to gauge their dog’s behavior. Questions were not super obvious like, “Is your dog grumpy?” or “Is your dog cheerful?”. Instead, they enlisted a series of inquiries to effectively determine each dog’s vibe. This featured questions on how pups behaved when groomed or bathed, whether theybarkedat things or situations they don’t like, or if they’ve eversnapped at or bitother dogs or people. The team then used this information to assign each animal an “irritability” score.\nWhen your dog growls, they’re expressing their emotions. A study found that you’ll likely be able to understand what they’re feeling.\nHow the Grumpy-Dog Study Worked\nAtEötvös Loránd Universityin Budapest, Vékony and her colleagues essentially tried their best to tick off every dog by presenting a favoritetreator toy in plain sight behind a V-shaped wire mesh fence. Naturally, an animal’s instinct is to head straight for the thing they want, so the test was to see how quickly they’d learn to go around the fence. The dogs were divided into three groups, starting with one  that had figure their way around the V alone. After the designated 60-second timer was up, most didn’t make it to the prize. Next, the researchers watched a group of dogs attempt the pseudo maze with assistance from their parents. To Vékony’s shock, dogs categorized as agreeable and those holding the “grumpy” label performed equally well in these groups.\n“We initially thought that dogs with more ‘smooth’ relationships with their owner would learn better from them so it was a surprise that we found no difference between dogs in learning from the owner,” Vékony explains. But the true revelation came with the third group, which went through the experiment with guidance from a stranger. What the researchers found was that the grumpy canines were significantly more successful in completing the task, in comparison to those defined as cheerful.\nThis body language is not as simple as you probably think.\n“Interestingly, it turned out that dogs that are less tolerant to being bathed or groomed or not getting things their way, in general, are also the ones who are more persistent and goal-oriented,” Vékony says, before noting that this does not mean crabbier dogs are necessarily more intelligent.\nA Grumpy Dog Is a Socially Intelligent Dog\nGiven the parameters of the study, these findings only indicate that grouchy pups are more susceptible to social learning. As she explains, “It’s not intelligence overall or problem-solving ability but specifically social learning. These dogs are sensitive and not very tolerant of unpleasant or uncomfortable social situations so it is understandable that they pay more keen attention to the actions of humans around them. And attention is a key ingredient of social learning.”\nOf course, there are a few caveats to the results. Notably, the researchers didn’t consider breed in the study. Additionally, behavioral issues, such as human or animal aggression or separation anxiety, were not factored in. Vékony confirms that to include these components, they would have needed a much larger sample size.\nTurns out, theycanexperience pretty complex emotions.\nThat being said, there is plenty to take away from the study — namely that grumpy dogs are not less good or productive. Clearly, the research shows that cranky pups can be perfectly well-behaved. And as long as you’re not trying to make them wear colorful sweaters or hang with too many upbeat characters, they’ll listen and pick up training cues quickly. Ultimately, these dogs are just comfortable with their wants and dislikes. They’re happy to pursue the things they like and avoid what they don’t. It’s something we could probably continue to learn from them.\n“After the events of the past few years, I’m surprised most people still have some of their social skills left,” Vékony says. “But as a grumpy human of a grumpy dog, I can say that sometimes we should just embrace our grumpiness.”",

  "page_content": "As all dog parents know, dogs come inmanyspectacular shapes, sizes and breeds, but according to a new study they only have five distinct personality types. The study published inScientific Reportstook a new approach to predicting and categorizing dog personalities, using an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to search through 70,000 behavioral records of dogs to find common threads running through the breeds.\nThe research was conducted over two years by Dr. Mohammad Amirhosseini of theUniversity of East London, Professor James Serpell of the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Veterinary Medicine, and the U.S. canine technology start-up Dogvatar, who sponsored the study.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhat are the five personality types in dogs?\nThe researchers found that all dogs could be classified into five groups: excitable/hyper-attached, anxious/fearful, aloof/predatory, reactive/assertive, or calm/agreeable. To discover their personality traits, dogs in the database were scored on behaviors, such as how they responded when unfamiliar people visited their home or if they were jealous when their parent gave affection to another animal.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nWhy is it important to understand your dog’s personality type?\nIn the U.S., nearly 50 percent of people who surrender dogs to animal rescue orgs cite behavioral problems as a contributory factor. The researchers hope that the study’s results could help foster stronger bonds between humans and their dogs, paving the way for more effective training programs and tailored pet-parent interaction.\nLead author of the study, Dr. Mohammad Amirhosseini, said that the research could assist with dog-human matchmaking, as well as suitability for becoming a working dog. “We believe that our findings could help dog training agencies more quickly and accurately assess which animals are likely to succeed long-term in careers, such as aiding law enforcement and assisting persons with disabilities. The results could also be used for helping shelters with proper placement, thus reducing the number of animals returned for not being a good fit with their adoptive families.”\nClinical animal behavioristEmily Birchsays that research into dogs’ personalities is not new; however, this new study could have a massive impact on understanding dog behavior.\n“As a behaviorist, I certainly see these personalities within consults, and the repercussions of this when dogs and owners are poorly matched. However, I always err on the side of caution when labeling individuals. There will be a wide scale within these personality types and an element of crossover. The data is also still relying primarily on pet owner reporting of behaviors, which can vary with environment and situation, and change over time, so this is something to be taken into account.”\nAdvancements in artificial intelligence are changing everything from the way we detect illnesses to how we keep our pets safe.\nPersonality type: excitable/hyper-attached\nThis personality type is characterized by relatively high levels of excitability, attachment/attention-seeking behavior,separation-related anxiety, and reduced fear compared with the other personality types.\nBirch says you’ll be able to spot an excitable/hyper-attached dog because they’re always busy and may have a little FOMO. “They get excited easily, take a long time to calm down, and are the life and soul of the party! They may be impulsive, thinking little about consequences before they act. They need to be with and around you and probably follow you on every toilet visit, in case they miss something exciting!”\nExcitable dogs need humans who can cope with their extra energy and neediness, and recognize that their dog won’t be happy being alone for extended periods.\nNumber 6 will probably surprise you.\nPersonality type: anxious/fearful\nAnxious/fearful dogs displayed relatively high fear of social (such as unfamiliar people and other dogs) and non-social events (new or unexpected situations). The anxious/fearful dog is cautious in disposition, thinking hard before doing things.\nBirch believes they could be anxious because of past trauma. “But their personality type might go some way to explain why some dogs can be attacked by other dogs and still be dog-friendly, or treated terribly by humans but still happy and confident around them; whilst other dogs can have the smallest of things happen, but take it really deeply and are highly traumatized by the event.”\nAnxious/fearful dogs are more likely to whine, jump up, or try to intervene when their parent strokes another animal, and they need patient parents willing to put in time to help them deal with fearful situations.\nPersonality type: aloof/predatory\nAloof/predatory dogs have lower levels of attachment/attention-seeking and higher levels of predatory behavior and aggression towards other dogs.\nThese dogs are notoriously hard to train, per Birch. “They will look at you when you call them, then trot off to carry on their own business. They’re happy in their own space and fiercely independent. They will happily go off hunting without a backwards glance and may even kill wildlife. They might give the illusion of being a bit dim but I assure you, they’re not.”\nParents of aloof/predatory pups must be consistent and find a way to motivate and reward a dog whose greatest joy is sniffing or chasing wildlife.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nPersonality type: reactive/assertive\nDogs who are reactive/assertive have heightened aggressive behavior across multiple domains, including aggression towards household members.Reactive dogstend to become aggressive when scolded or shouted at by their parents, and fearful of sudden loud noises, such as a vacuum cleaner being switched on or an object being dropped.\n“These dogs are on the offensive and know what they like and do not like,” Birch says. “Their traits may have been bred into working dogs over generations – if you’re a shepherding breed, you need to be aware of predators and not be scared of seeing them off when protecting your livestock.”\nWith a reactive dog, work to identify the specific triggers that set your dog off. A trigger acts as a stimulus to make your dog react dramatically. After identifying triggers, try to avoid them while you work on a training plan, which should be based on positive reinforcement and patience.\nPersonality type: calm/agreeable\nAccording to the research, calmer dogs were less likely to chase birds or cats than their counterparts and were quicker to learn new tricks or tasks. “They’re easy to live with, go with the flow and make great pets. They may not set the world on fire with their working ability, but they are worth their weight in gold,” Birch says.\nDue to their peaceful nature, Birch rarely meets these dogs in her practice. Calm dogs tend to beideal family dogsbecause they’re great around young children. Or, if you’re getting older and want a dog who can match your pace, a calm canine could be precisely what you’re looking for.\nHow can this research be applied in the future?\nDr Amirhosseini says: “We are still working on analyzing the potential relationship between human personality traits and these dog personality types. Personality type and behaviors are closely intertwined, so a key future outcome is understanding effective training techniques for a dog’s personality type. In theory, in the future rescue organizations and shelters could use a tool to understand both a dog’s personality and how good a fit it is for the right owner.”",

  "page_content": "I was at a small housewarming party recently where a guest arrived late, looking harried. She explained that one of her dogs, Max, had recently passed away, and her second dog, Penny, was taking it pretty hard. Penny had always struggled with anxiety, but with consistent care and training had made tremendous progress over the past couple of years. Now, without Max around, she was reverting to her old ways.\nShe waseating less, didn’t play as much, wouldn’t engage with the other dogs at daycare, and was having accidents in the house. (Penny’s mom had to clean up one of these accidents before she left, which was why she was late.)\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nAccording to a paperpublished in the journalin 2022, Penny’s behavior is not unusual. The study looked at data collected from 426 adults with multiple pet dogs and found that surviving dogs who lost a canine companion showed “grief-related and emotional patterns.” The most common behaviors pet parents reported were attention-seeking (67 percent); playing less (57 percent); a decline in activity (46 percent);sleeping more(35 percent);increased fearfulness(35 percent); eating less (32 percent); and increased vocalization,like barkingand whining (30 percent).\nHow long do dogs grieve?\nOf those participants who noticed a negative behavior change in their surviving dog, about a third said it lasted between two and six months after the death of their companion, 29.4 percent said it lasted less than two months, and 24.9 percent said it lasted over six months.\nThe study also found that the amount of time the dogs had spent together had no effect on the surviving dog’s likelihood of exhibiting negative behavior. A much stronger predictor, they found, was the quality of the dogs’ relationship. Dogs were far more likely to play less and show disrupted feeding patterns if their relationship with the deceased pup had been described as “friendly,” rather than “agnostic” or “mutual tolerance.”\nEnd-of-life veterinary specialist Dr. Shea Cox on how to make the most difficult decision in your pet parenting journey.\nDogs and humans influence each other\nThese findings are significant, because even though most dog parents have spent hours observing and dissecting our dogs’ most minute behaviors, preferences, and quirks, there’s still a lot we don’t know about the inner lives of our furry companions. As Dr. Stefania Uccheddu, one of the authors of the study, tells us, the study was born out of a desire to shed light on a fundamental but still under-explored area of dog’s lives: their complex emotions, particularly grief.\n“In general, emotions are perhaps the most enigmatic sphere of animal life — the most difficult to explore,” Dr. Uccheddu explains. It’s this challenge, she says that makes them an especially compelling undertaking for scientists. She adds that one of the findings that surprised her the most was that a surviving dog was more likely to eat less if their pet parent was also displaying signs of grief. This could be the result of “emotional contagion” between the dog and human, or the result of a dog’s ability to pick up on the negative emotions of their pet parents.\n“Dogs have become extremely sensitive to human communicative gestures and facial expressions, especially their emotional expressions,” Dr. Uccheddu says. Indeed, the study found a positive correlation between an increased fear level in the surviving dog and the pet parent’s own level of suffering and anger. As two social species, Dr. Uccheddu explained, dogs’ and humans’ emotions are highly susceptible to the emotions of those around them.\nAre we just projecting?\nHow can we know whether the change in behavior we’re seeing is really grief or something else? Are we projecting our own human emotions onto our pets? “I think anyone who has lived with animals for long enough has seen them mourn the passing of a household member, whether it’s an animal or not,” says Robert Haussmann, a certified dog trainer, co-founder ofDogboy NYC, andKinship Collectivemember. “But is it mourning? Is it separation distress? Is it change in routine distress? Those are all important things to bring up.”\nEven though it’s the last thing you want to think about.\nAs Haussmann notes, it can be tempting for pet parents to anthropomorphize our pups. And we’re not completely unjustified in doing so. Modern dogs have been bred for centuries to be social and to read human emotions. “That’s why pet dogs are able to be pet dogs,” Haussmann says. “We’ve gone out of our way to make them social creatures, and they’re also highly emotional creatures.”\nSo, while we can’t say for sure that what a surviving dog is experiencing is definitely grief as we humans conceive of grief, we can’t dismiss the possibility that they’re feeling something similar to our loss either. “In my opinion, I do think dogs mourn their companions,” Haussmann says.\nDogs are pretty stoic, he notes, so they might not display their grief by moping around the house. They might behave like they did before but be more jumpy, bark more, orpull more on the leash. “Give the dog some time to adjust, and be proactive,” Haussmann says. If they get anxious or aggressive or their new behavior does seem like it requires training,reach out to a professionalwho can help put a plan together for the dog. “If that dog was mirroring their big brother or sister and now they’re gone, you might need you to be a better teacher.”\nAnd above all, Haussmann says, adjusting to the new normal just takes time. “I always point out to people: This is an animal without a language center. They’re not using inner dialogue. They’re not going to journal about it. It’s something that is very different from us, and we need to respect it.”",

  "page_content": "In an early episode ofThe Sopranos, Tony Soprano asks his therapist Dr. Melfi whether she thinks, because of genetics, his son will inherit his behavioral tendencies, like he did with that of his own mafioso father. “My son is doomed, right?” he asks. But Melfi says no, genetics are only part of the puzzle of what makes up a person. Though your pet might not be hanging out at the Bada Bing (theSopranosconnection is admittedly a stretch — apologies, we’re in the middle of a rewatch), the same is true for them.\nWhile your pet’s behavior is informed by a number of things, including genetics, environment, background, and health, studies show that the way you parent your dog or cat really does make a difference. Let’s take a look at the science behind it.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nStudies suggest animals do think of us as their parents.\nBefore we go further, we’d like to reassure you — you are not in an unrequited relationship with your pet. Studies done on both dogs and catssuggest the bondbetween pets and their guardians actually mirrors, in some ways, the relationship between human children and their caretakers.\nA2015 studyshowed levels of oxytocin (sometimes referred to as the “love hormone”) rose in both dogs and their human caregivers when they gazed into each other’s eyes, or when the human engaged in petting the dog. Thissame mutual risein oxytocin is seen between parents and newborn children when gazing and touching, and helps build a bond between the two.\nYou love them like a child, but is the feeling mutual?\nAnd a2019 studyshowed that cats have distinct attachment styles to their human parents, comparable to those seen in child-parent attachment; this has alsobeen observedmany times instudiesbetweendogs and their caretakers. “In both dogs and cats, attachment to humans may represent an adaptation of the offspring-caretaker bond,” the study's lead author, animal behavior researcher Kristyn Vitale, saidin a press release. “Attachment is a biologically relevant behavior. Our study indicates that when cats live in a state of dependency with a human, that attachment behavior is flexible and the majority of cats use humans as a source of comfort.”\nThese are just a few examples from a growing area of study, so rest assured: You aren’t wrong to consider your pet a member of your family.\nDifferent parenting styles can lead to different behavioral outcomes in dogs.\n“Dog breeds can havebreed-specific behaviorsthat another breed would either be physically incapable of doing or would greatly struggle to learn how to do,” Lauren Brubaker, a dog behavioral researcher, tells Kinship. Still, she thinks personal history, which includes how they’re parented, has “the biggest influence on their behavior.”\nIn a2022 study, published in the journal Animal Cognition, Brubaker and researcher Monique Udellsurveyed dog parentsabout their parenting style; specifically, they asked about their expectations for their dogs, and how they typically respond to their dogs’ needs. The results placed them into categories similar to groups already established by those who study the relationship between human children and their parents: “authoritative” (meaning a style of parenting where high expectations are matched by a high responsiveness toward needs), “authoritarian” (where high expectations are met with low responsiveness), and “permissive” (where low expectations matched low responsiveness).\nWe asked both animal behaviorists and human psychologists howyoucan deal with leaving your dog home alone.\nTheir dogs underwent three behavioral tests, the first measuring their attachment to their human parent, the second testing their sociability, and the third monitoring their ability to get a treat from a puzzle toy with different levels of help from their parent. The results showed that each parenting style was associated with a different behavioral outcome.\n“Authoritative parenting, having high expectations while also being responsive to your dog’s needs can lead to measurable positive outcomes“including increased feelings of security, stress reliance, and problem solving persistence in dogs,” Udell says. These benefits, Udell adds, are similar to those experienced by human children with authoritative parents.\nDogs with authoritarian owners were more insecurely attached to their parents, and dogs with permissive owners were more likely to follow the social cues of a stranger than their parent; neither of these groups had success with the puzzle.\n“Some pet parents, for example those with a permissive parenting style, exhibit great warmth and understanding towards their dogs, but may overlook the importance of having high expectations,” Udell says. “In fact, having consistent realistic expectations and rules, engaging in reward-based training, and encouraging problem-solving are all important ways to help your dog build confidence, feel comfortable in their surroundings, and grow in their relationship with you.” The good news is, she says, it’s never too late to start building this deeper connection with your dog.\nWhich comes first: a nervous person or a nervous pup?\nCat behavior is also affected by their human.\nDogs aren’t the only ones being influenced by their human parents. A2019 studysurveyed cat parents about their personality and the health and behavior of their cats. The humans’ answers  weremapped onto a systemyou might be familiar with: the Big Five Inventory (BFI), which evaluates personality in terms of agreeableness, conscientiousness, extroversion, neuroticism, and openness. And — please don’t allow this to stress you out (it’s bad for your cat, apparently) — the study’s results showed a connection between parent personality and certain aspects of cats’ behavior and emotional health.\nIncreased agreeableness in humans, for example, correlated with friendlier and healthier cats. High conscientiousness was associated with cats displaying less anxious and avoidant behaviors, and high neuroticism scores correlated with increased incidence of stress-related illnesses in cats.\nLauren Finka, one of the study’s authors, previously spoke to Kinship about her findings. “This study really highlights the potential ways we as owners might impact the behavior and well-being of cats and the important role our personalities might play in relation to this,” Finka says. “Our findings closely mirror those identified within parent-child relationships, suggesting that, just like children, cats are very sensitive to and influenced by the ways we care for and interact with them.”\nOK, OK, don’t come for us. We know dogs and kids are very different to raise, but this study finds they respond to different parenting styles in similar ways.\nLike dogs, cats can also build confidence and reduce stress through positive reinforcement-based training with their parents. A visit to the vet is one of the most stressful situations for both cats and their humans  (and this stress can sometimes lead to parents avoidingregular vet visitsaltogether).\nIna 2018 study, published inApplied Animal Behaviour Science, scientists at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, Austria, 22 cats were split into two groups: half were trained, using their preferred treats, to use their cat carrier for a mock vet visit, half were not. Researchers observed the trained cats were less stressed and made it through their appointments more quickly than the untrained cats, showing that it’s possible to help your cat exist more confidently in the human world.\nDon’t stress if you think you’ve parented your pet “incorrectly.”\nBrubaker says pet parents shouldn’t worry too much about getting it wrong. “If I could tell pet parents one thing, it would be to love and enjoy your pet, have fun with them, and know that they love you unconditionally,” she tells Kinship. “If someone is looking to be a better pet parent, I recommend positive reinforcement training classes from a reputable trainer as a great place to start.”\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nOne way to think about training with positive reinforcement, Udell says, is that you’re teaching your pet how to have their needs met in a world where humans control most of the resources. “What we view as misbehavior is often due to a lack of understanding about how to get needs met,” she says. Positive reinforcement is focused on recognition of what your pet wants and needs, and it shows your pet “exactly what behavior is necessary to have a need met, when this outcome is possible (or not), and that you are a trusted source of help.”\nResearch has also shown, Brubaker says,that playis an important part of pet behavior and development. “Invest in somefun toysfor your dog or cat so you can play with them!” And finally, she says, make sure your pet gets an appropriate amount of exercise. Your cat might not be able to buy you a “World’s Best Mom” mug, but they will be able to exist a bit more confidently in the world. And what more does a pet parent need?\nReferences:\nSocial Evolution. Oxytocin-Gaze Positive Loop and the Coevolution of Human-Dog Bonds\nSocial Evolution.

Regular cleaning, parasite prevention, and prompt veterinary attention for any abnormalities are crucial for maintaining healthy dog ears.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThe anatomy of the dog ear\nA dog’s ear is an incredibly complex structure, with names like“anthelix”and“medial process of the antitragus”used to describe every bump, fold, and ridge. Knowing all those tiny structures isn’t super important, but being familiar with the general structure of the ear can be helpful, especially if your dog is prone to ear issues.

It also contains the vestibular system, which is responsible for maintaining balance.\nFacts about dog ears\nDogs have at least 18 muscles that work to tilt, raise, and rotate their ears, which helps them identify and capture sounds from different directions.\nUnlike humans, who have a very short ear canal, dogs have a long, narrow ear canal that makes almost a 90-degree bend as it travels to the deeper parts of the ear.\nCompared to cats, dogs tend to have many moreear problemsandear infections— especially breeds with floppy ears like Basset Hounds.\nYour dog’s hearing ability is dependent on their breed and age. Generally, dogs and people both hear similar low-frequency sounds. The average hearing range for a dog is usually around 67 hertz to 45,000 hertz (45 kilohertz). Human hearing stretches from 20 hertz to 20,000 hertz (20 kilohertz), but most adults actually top out at 16k hertz. Dogs also have much more sensitive hearing than humans, picking up ultra-quiet noises that their parents can’t hear.\nDomestic dogs can hear significantly higher frequency sounds than humans, though not as high as cats. They also have a different acoustic perception of the world. Sounds that don’t bother people often have high-frequency tones that can scare dogs.\nThere are many sounds only dogs can hear. For example, ultrasonic dog whistles have been used in dog training because they produce sounds at frequencies higher than those audible to humans but well within the range of a dog’s hearing. Even during the quiet hours of the night, the world is a noisy place for dogs. Because of this super hearing ability, other sounds dogs may pick up on include the high-frequency pulse of the crystal resonator used in digital alarm clocks, bodily vibrations of termites in the walls, potential sounds before an earthquake, and high pitch whirling of electronic devices like vacuums and screw drivers.\nA dog’s level of attention can be determined by watching their ears. Erect ears facing forward indicate that they’re engaged, and slightly pulled-back ears signal that they’re feeling friendly; ears laidtightly backagainst the head suggest they’re feeling fearful or timid.\nThey can tilt, turn, raise, and lower their ears one at a time.\nVertical toward the jaw, then taking an almost 90-degree turn horizontally toward the eardrum. This makes examination challenging and predisposes dogs to a variety of ear ailments.\nA black-and-tan Coonhound named Lou from Milwaukie, WI, whose ears each measure 13.38 inches, holds the title for longest ears according to theGuinness Book of World Records. That length has a purpose: to help direct scent to the hound’s sensitive sniffer.\nUniversity of Cincinnati researcher Pete Scheifele, also the director of UC’s Bioacoustics and Canine Audiology Clinic, is developing a hearing aid that will help dogs with acquired hearing loss.\nBreeds like Cocker Spaniels, Poodles, Labrador Retrievers, and Shar-peis get ear infections more commonly. This islikely dueto a combination of anatomy, allergies, and genetic factors.\nDogs can hear much quieter sounds than people can, with some reports suggesting that they can hear sounds in the negative 5 to negative 15 decibel range. This means that they pick up on sounds that are about half as quiet as humans can.\nPuppies are born deaf and blind, with their eyelids and ears sealed closed. Their eyes and ears begin to open around 14 days of age, allowing them to begin to see and hear their surroundings. Their hearing ability continues to evolve over the next four to six weeks of lifeas they continue to grow.\nSome dog breeds are predisposed to deafness due to genetic factors. Dalmatians have one of the highest incidences of deafness, with around 30 percent of them being deaf in one or both ears. A merle or dapple coat color (like that found in Great Danes, Dachshunds, and Collies) has a strong association with deafness as well.\nCats are even more sensitive to sounds than dogs are. They pick up on low-frequency vibrations down to 45 hertz and high-frequency buzzes up to 64,000 hertz. This is well beyond the dog’s 67 to 45,000 hertz range.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nDogs have great control over their ears, using a number of small muscles to move their ears to better focus on and locate sounds. Their ear movements also accent many of their cute and curious expressions.\nDog ears are soft because of their tightly packed hairs and lack of bones. Cartilage, which is much softer and more flexible than bone, gives the ears their shape.\nDogs can hear frequencies that are about twice as high-pitched than those that humans can. Humans can hear up to about 20,000 hertz, while dogs can hear frequencies up to 45,000 hertz.\nMany dogs with healthy ears never need theirears cleaned. Dogs with allergies, previous ear infections, or other ear issues may need their ears cleaned up to twice a week. Always follow your vet’s advice about when and how to clean your dog’s ears.\nPuppies are born with their ear canals completely shut. They begin to hear when the canals open at around two weeks of age, but often don’t have fully developed hearing abilities until they are six to eight weeks old.\nReferences:\nVeterian Key – Pinna and External Ear Canal\nVeterian Key – Pinna and External Ear Canal\nFrequency Hearing Ranges in Dogs and Other Species\nFrequency Hearing Ranges in Dogs and Other Species\nEpidemiological Study of Dogs with Otitis Externa in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia\nEpidemiological Study of Dogs with Otitis Externa in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia\nSurvey of Otitis Externa in American Cocker Spaniels in Finland\nSurvey of Otitis Externa in American Cocker Spaniels in Finland\nDeafness Prevalence and Pigmentation and Gender Associations in Dog Breeds at Risk\nDeafness Prevalence and Pigmentation and Gender Associations in Dog Breeds at Risk",

    "title": "Why Are Dogs Obsessed With Sniffing the Snow?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/dog-sniffing-snow"
  },
  "page_content": "While shoveling the three feet of snow we received in Flagstaff, Arizona, the past two days, I kept my focus on trying to be more like the dogs I saw walking by and less like the people I saw walking by. The dogs were gleeful, enthusiastic, energetic, and very focused on the snow. They had their noses in it much of the time. The people looked weary, resigned, exhausted, and they were either looking at their phones, or off in the distance in a glazed manner.\nEven people who love snow find three feet of it all at once tiring and frankly a bit daunting, but dogs seem more likely to take the “more is always better” approach to snow. With a Nor’Easterslamming the East Coast today, I’m sure many pet parents will feel that familiar dread of having to pull out the shovel once more. But their dogs will have a great time.  If you have a dog who is obsessed with sniffing the snow, they are in good company because that is common in many dogs. But why?\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nSnow days are fun—until your pup needs to do their thing outside.\nWhat about snow makes the smells more enticing?\nWhat is in the snow that makes dogs so obsessed with it? Another way to get at what makes snow so enticing to dogs is to ask what’snotin it? Because the reason dogs love to sniff snow — and sniff it, and sniff it, and sniff it — is there’s just so much in there worth sniffing. Starting with some very basic science, snow is water and is therefore wet. Moisture tends to hold smells longer, so snow is filled with smells that can’t escape. That ends the basic science lesson, but to summarize, dogs love to sniff to experience the world, and the snow is full of things to sniff and experience.\nWe all knowdogs love to sniff the grassbecause of all the interesting smells to be found there, and anything that dogs can smell is likely to linger longer in the snow than in the grass, so there is more to smell and much of it will smell stronger, too. Any tracks or trails that dogs detect will be easier to follow because the snow helps keep them intact. So, if a squirrel, deer, cat, or another dog walked across the snow and more falling snow covered it, those trails will remain strong to a dog’s nose longer than usual. The delight dogs take in finding multiple scents criss-crossing under and on top of the snow all over their usual haunts explains their obsession with sniffing snow.\nHow to make the snowy season your dog's favorite time of year.\nWhy is it good to let them sniff the snow, even if you’re desperate for hot cocoa in front of the fire?\nDogs need the opportunity toengage in their natural behaviors— it’s so important for their wellbeing. When we prioritize creating situations that allow dogs to be dogs, our best friends are happier and lead better lives. Sniffing is one of those dog activities that gives dogs so much joy and satisfaction. They need stimulation every day, and that can sometimes be tricky in winter because it’s not always as easy to get out for as long each day for walks or other outings. You are not alone if your dog is a little more cooped up inside when it’s cold, but you really care about avoiding boredom for your dog.\nThat’s when letting your dog sniff the snow for what seems like forever is so valuable. The mental stimulation of sniffing for all or most of a walk does far more to help them be content and ready to relax than exercise alone. Outings based around letting your dogfollow their nose, or “sniffaris,” as I prefer to call them, are an excellent way to do right by your dog. Simply knowing that dogs need the chance to do dog things and acting accordingly makes life better for them. That’s why I encourage you to let them keep on sniffing, even if you spend the walk figuring out how many days are left until beach weather.\nIf your teeth are chattering, theirs probably are, too.\nWhen is it time to stop the sniffing?\nIf your dog wants to stay outside sniffing the snow indefinitely, you will have to be the one to decide when to come back inside. It’s not easy to make the call, but if either of the following are true, it’s time to be the grown-up and head in with your dog.\nThat may meanthey are shivering, snow is collecting in balls on their fur, they are prancing in the snow in a way that suggests they don’t want their feet on or in the snow anymore, they are actually limping, or you see any other indication they’re having trouble handling the cold. Ideally, you would bring your dog inside before these signs of trouble, but if you do notice any, it’s time to leave the snow and go inside to warm up.\nWhether you are cold or bored or need to get back to work, or having any other struggle related to staying outside, if you go back in, it’s a good idea to bring your dog in with you. It’s not good to leave them out there alone dealing with the challenges of the cold, chemicals that could harm them,such as salt, antifreeze, or falling ice.\nIf you are one of the lucky ones with a fenced-in yard, you may be able to leave them out there a little longer if you are watching them constantly and monitoring their behavior for any signs of discomfort with the conditions. In general, in harsh conditions, it’s preferable to be outside with them rather than for them to be out there alone. Of course, some dogs are so well-suited to the cold and love it so much that the suggestion to bring them in could have some exceptions.\nThey love sticking their noses in snow for reasons beyond the sniffing to be had.\nWhen your dog dives headfirst into the snow headfirst or pokes their noses into piles of it, that might not actually be about sniffing. Many dogs love the other sensory aspects of snow. They seek out the cold, fluffy feeling of snow and probably relish the different sensory experiences and the playful opportunity this new substance offers them. That’s why they roll in it and toss it about. It’s fun and interesting and different from what they encounter on most days.\nUnlike a lot of wild animals, ourdomestic dogs are neophilic, meaning they like new things. Of course, that’s not true of all dogs, but the majority of behaviorally healthy, well-socialized dogs are drawn to the unfamiliar, and snow fits into that category. Even if they experienced it in previous years, it’s new again this year to dogs who live in all but the most chronically cold and snowiest of habitats. Exploring snow is fun for many dogs, and dogs tend toexplore the world with their noses. The combination so often leads to an obsession with sniffing snow that I fully endorse indulging.",

    "title": "How Deep Is the Love for Our Dogs?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-lifestyle/dog-with-love"
  },
  "page_content": "It’s easy to see that humans love dogs. Greece, India, Sumatra, Egypt, Scotland, Turkey, China: cultures around the world have dog-headed (cynocephalic) heroes or gods. The existence of a word to describe such phenomena speaks to how common they are. Although other mythical human/animal chimeras are known — the centaur and minotaur, for example — none are as widespread as those involving dogs. This depiction of creatures with the traits of both humans and dogs attests to the longstanding idea that we are connected. We are, it seems, naturally predisposed to formdeep connections with dogs.\nWhy do we love dogs so much?\nChemical systems responsible for the most powerful feelings of love between humans are also activated during interactions with dogs. This means that physiologically speaking, we bond with our dogs in the same way we do with our children: through a positive-feedback loop involving oxytocin, a hormone involved in many aspects of social behavior.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nPetting our dogsraises levels of oxytocinin both species, which makes us feel closer, which makes us seek out more physical contact, which raises our oxytocin levels, which makes us feel even closer, and so on (and on and on). Even gazing into one another’s eyes without touching generates the same pattern. Studies of canine attachment show that dogs who have strong connections to their people are more confident and better able to explore the world. (It’s no coincidence that scientists have found that to be the case in human children as well.)\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nDogs and people recognize emotions in members of the other species to the degree that is typically only possible within one’s own species. Dogs are able to distinguish neutral human expressions from ones conveying emotions, as well as to make a distinction between different emotional expressions — say, happy human faces and angry ones. This isn’t news to anyone who has ever lived with a dog; we’re all aware that trying to keep our emotions a secret from our dogs is impossible. They just know.\nWhy do dogs love humans?\nWe care for our dogs with love and an emotional connection matched by no other. Even people with no particular training in canine behavior are generally good at reading some dog emotions. Asad dogis easy to recognize, and so is ahappy one. Highlyfearful dogscan’t fool people either, though those without much dog experience don’t always recognize dogs who are alittle bitanxious orsort ofnervous.\nThe close connection between dogs and people is evident in another tool in the canine tool box: they are adept at using facial recognition to identify individuals. Even more interesting, dogs “read” human faces in much the same way that people do, with a specialized part of the brain used for processing that particular type of visual input. People also understand dog vocalizations. For example, we are able to recognizedifferent types of growls. In one study, people were easily able to distinguish play growls fromaggressive onesand were even able to identify growls emitted in two different, potentially aggressive contexts: growling atanother dog over foodand growling at an approaching stranger. People with more dog experience did better, but even novices had success.\nJust as we understand dog vocalizations, they are able to make sense of ours, and are responsive toour tone of voiceas well asour words. In both human and dog brains, the same area of the temporal lobe responds to human speech; crying and laughing anddog whimpersand intense barking cause activity near the primary auditory cortex of both species.\nSo, it’s a simple biological fact that physiologically, visually, acoustically and cerebrally, humans and dogs just get each other. The closeness we feel to dogs is a natural outcome of that biological connection.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nBuilding a love connection\nBeyond biology, there are plenty of catalysts for this mutually rewarding relationship. As with human friendships, when we spend time with a dog and have experiences together, our love grows, the relationship deepens, and we feel even more bonded. It seems that the more we share, the closer we feel.\nOne of the things we can share with dogs is a sense of purpose. That’s why it makes sense that some of the best examples of the deepest connections between people and dogs come from teamwork — working together to accomplish a common goal. When a dog and a person team up, the connection between our species seems to be the strongest and most inspiring.\nThere’s a reason working dogs and their handlers are called only “teams.” A dog and a person with a job have a mutual purpose, and the cooperation and partnership involved naturally lend themselves to a closeness that extends beyond the work. Whether the jobinvolves search and rescue, detection, military, police, or service work, they become close when dogs and people share a purpose. Equal partners who rely on each other, each contributes a unique skill set that must be integrated for success. That trust is part of what makes them feel close and able to work together successfully for a common purpose. The positive feedback loop of trust and accomplishment further bonds them.\nThe internal experience of deep love and connection to a dog is one way to be aware of the closeness we share with canines, but we can also observe it from the outside. Takecanine freestyle, a competition based on a combination of obedience training, trick training, and dance. Simply put, it’s dancing to music with a dog, with the purpose of demonstrating artistry, style, athleticism, and the ability to work as a team. Dogs doing freestyle who are literally in sync with their people inspire those who watch them because the behavior in the routine is a visual and symbolic manifestation of emotional closeness.\nHow we became human — an ongoing exploration.\nDogs often prefer the folks who play with them to the folks who feed them, even when really great treats are involved. Play is so powerful that across a wide variety of species, mothers who play with their offspring are more likely to have strong relationships with them. Having fun together may be the very best way for individuals to build a relationship.\nTo dog with love\nOur 30,000 year-old relationship with canines has evolved as a love letter to dogs, so to speak. This deep interspecies connection cannot be explained by logic or reason. The best way to describe the most magical human/dog relationships is simply to say that the dog and the person are in love. The dogs involved are often described as “heart dogs,” “soulmates,” or simply as the “love of our lives.” These are the once-in-a-lifetime dogs that change us forever.\nWe love our dogs and feel connected to them in a way that defies definition, yet we understand it so well. Long before the biology of our deep and beautiful friendships was understood, we knew that our bond was special. The hyperbolic “We can’t live without them!” may not be literally true, but most of us certainly could not live happily without them.",

  "page_content": "Nothing is sweeter than the sight of a pup’s little arms and legs going wild in their sleep (bonus points if there’s some yapping involved). If you’ve ever been lucky enough to witness one of those slumbering one-man (or, er, one-dog) shows, you’ve probably found yourself wondering what exactly the adorable little guys are dreaming about. Good news, especially if you need an ego boost: According to experts, your pup’s probably dreaming about you.\nDog sleep behavior\nWhen it comes to the science behind dog naps, there’s no big mystery. It turns out a dog’s sleep behavior is pretty similar to a human’s. “Dogs undergo Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, the stage associated with vivid dreaming in humans,” saysKinship Collective memberand Antelope Pet’s chief veterinary officer Dr. Lindsey Wendt. “The electrical sequences recorded in the brain during this phase align with the patterns observed in humans, reinforcing the idea that dogs experience a dream state similar to ours.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nDr. Wendt adds that you can observe your pup’s sleep stages with your own two eyes. “Identifying when your dog is dreaming doesn’t require resorting to invasive measures like electrical recordings — it’s a relatively straightforward process,” she says. “As their sleep deepens, you’ll notice a shift in their breathing pattern towards regularity. Approximately 20 minutes into sleep for an average-sized dog, the initial dream phase typically commences.”\nIt’s a personal preference, but here are the pros and cons.\nThere are a few things to look out for when this switch into REM happens. “This transition becomes apparent as the dog’s breathing turns shallow and irregular. You might observe peculiar muscle twitches, and if you pay very close attention, you’ll even see the dog’s eyes moving behind closed eyelids,” Dr. Wendt says. “These eye movements signify that the dog is actively engaged with dream images, perceiving them as if they were real-world scenes. Such eye movements are particularly indicative of the dreaming sleep phase. When humans are awakened during the REM sleep phase, they consistently report having been in a state of dreaming.”\nWhat do dogs dream about?\nDr. Deirdre Barrett, a clinical and evolutionary psychologist at Harvard Medical School, spent years researching dog sleep habits, and she’s come to some conclusions about what pups may dream about. First, she’s clear that, since dogs can’t communicate using language, no one can know for certain what they remember from their sleep. “Anything about what animals dream, or even if they dream, is speculative,”Dr. Barrett told. “The only two animals even suggested to have ever told their dreams to a human are the signing gorillas Koko and Michael.”\nBut she agrees with Dr. Wendt, since dogs and humans have matching REM behavior, we likely have matching dream behavior, too. She adds that their dream habits may not beexactlylike ours, even if the mechanics are very similar. “In terms of potential differences, we know that small animals, like mice, go through the sleep stages much more quickly so they would likely be having shorter, more frequent dreams,” she said.\n“Let sleeping dogs lie” is more than just a confusing old saying.\nBut it is possible to guess about the content of puppy dreams. “While we can’t definitively pinpoint the content of a dog’s dreams, research emphasizes that dogs likely dream about familiar activities,” says Dr. Wendt. And those familiar activities include hanging out with you, their bestie. “Since dogs often engage with their owners in various daily interactions, it’s plausible that elements of these experiences could find their way into a dog’s dreams.”\nDr. Barrett agrees. “Humans dream about the same things they’re interested in by day, though more visually and less logically,” she toldPeople. “There’s no reason to think animals are any different. Since dogs are generally extremely attached to their human owners, it’s likely your dog is dreaming of your face, your smell, and of pleasing or annoying you.”\nSo, just like humans, pups are probably dreaming about all kinds of things from their daily life. That could mean they’re chasing their tail or rummaging through the trash in their sleep, but it could also mean they’re dreaming of a fun play session with their favorite person: you. All the more reason to “aww” at those twitching, sleepy little paws.",

  },
  "page_content": "Oxytocin — known as the “love hormone” — is that seemingly magical chemical we usually associate with baby-parent bonding and post-coital snuggling. Turns out that oxytocin also plays a major role in humans’ relationships with dogs, too. Much of the early research on oxytocin is focused on people, but research shows that it also impacts our connections with pups.\nHow does oxytocin work?\nLet’s start with human bonding: Oxytocin levels have been shown to be higher in people who have been in romantic relationships for three months than in those who are single. And, it turns out, couples with higher oxytocin levels at three months are more likely to be together six months later.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nIn another type of emotional relationship, mothers who gaze at their babies have higher levels of oxytocin. Mothers with higher oxytocin levels engage in more mothering behavior, which raises oxytocin levels in their babies, which leads babies to be more attached and attentive to their mothers, creating a never-ending positive feedback loop. Oxytocin levels also increase in mothers and babies who touch frequently and decrease when they’re prevented from touching.\nIn a parallel phenomenon, petting causes humans and dogs to experience an increase in oxytocin. Because dogs affect us and our oxytocin levels much the same as human babies do, the bond we have with our dogs can feel like the bond between mothers and children. The mechanism behind the connection is the same.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nLooking at dogs and oxytocin\nA 2015 studywas the first to demonstrate oxytocin’s cross species effects. In the study (Oxytocin-gaze Positive Loop and the Coevolution of Human-dog Bonds), dog-human pairs were observed interacting during a 30-minute period. The dogs who gazed at their guardians longer displayed higher levels of oxytocin than those in pairs who did not gaze at one another for as long. A caveat: Like many other areas of canine behavior, eye contact is complex, nuanced, and context-dependent. While gazing into the eyes of a dog you love and who loves you can create a tender moment, staring into the eyes of an unknown or unfriendly dog can be perceived by the dog as threatening and scary.\nBiologists were excited to find underlying physiological mechanisms common to the formation of both romantic and parental social bonds. Dog lovers were enthralled by the evidence that we love our dogs like we love people, scientifically speaking. It’s possible that the process of domestication was facilitated by canines co-opting this human social-bonding process.\nIn the same study, researchers performed another experiment to further explore the role of oxytocin in dog-human bonding. After administering the hormone to dogs via the nose, they observed that female dogs given oxytocin gazed at their guardians for longer periods than did female dogs given saline as a control (it didn’t affect male dogs the same way). Even though people were not given oxytocin, human oxytocin levels also increased after interacting with female dogs whohadreceived it. Researchers are not sure why the behavior of female — but not male — dogs was affected.\n(And your own, while you’re at it.)\nCaregiving models\nIn addition to facilitating the formation of strong bonds between mothers and babies as well as people and dogs, oxytocin is critical for the development of our caregiving behavior toward both newborns and dogs. If an individual is cute, we feel love, and if we feel love, we want to take care of what we love. Infantile characteristics seen in many young mammals — proportionally large head, big and wide-spaced eyes, chubby cheeks, small mouth and nose — activate our instinct to be caring and protective because they trigger a release of oxytocin.\nA lot of the research about caregiving and oxytocin was done with mice, but the same pattern occurs in many mammals. Baby mice cry when they are separated from their mothers, who respond to those vocalizations by going to them. Mothers even respond to the calls of unrelated baby mice. (Female mice without babies rarely respond.)\nMouse mothers must learn to respond to those cries, and oxytocin is necessary for that education to take place. Oxytocin changes their brains, and only after those changes do they react to their offsprings’ vocalizations by attending to them. The changes occur in the left auditory cortex, a region of the brain that scientists recently discovered has neurons that produce oxytocin; it also has a large number of oxytocin receptors.\nTo test whether this area of the brain is important for maternal care, scientists used a drug to block its activity, and found that females who received the drug ceased to respond to their crying babies. They also found that inexperienced females who had been unresponsive became responsive after being injected with oxytocin.\nIt’s a nice thought.\nTuning in to social signals\nIn addition to playing a role in our attachment to each other, oxytocin can affect dogs’ responses to our social cues.In a 2015 study(Oxytocin Enhances the Appropriate Use of Human Social Cues by the Domestic Dog in an Object Choice Task), dogs were divided into two groups; one group was given an injection of oxytocin, the other, of saline solution. The oxytocin group was more responsive to social cues by humans indicating the location of food than those in the control group who had received saline. Dogs were more successful at following human cues to find the food when they had been treated with oxytocin; this was true for two types of human signaling: gazing at and pointing to the location of the hidden food.\nThe study’s most exciting finding was that oxytocin makes dogs more receptive to social signals. Since oxytocin is also known to make memories of negative social interactions more intense as well, it is fair to say that this chemical may allow individuals of a variety of species to focus their attention on social information and enhance their ability to understand it at a deeper level. Though oxytocin is well known to promote positive emotional states, this research suggests that it can have a negative effect in some circumstances.\nMany other studies have explored the effects of oxytocin on dogs. Inone published in 2016,Differential Effects of Oxytocin on Social Sensitivity in Two Distinct Breeds of Dogs,oxytocin was given to Border Collies and Siberian Huskies to test its influence on their social responsiveness. The former are as famous for being cooperative workers as the latter are for working on their own. The results? Border Collies had a stronger response to receiving oxytocin than the Siberian Huskies, as measured by their behavior after treatment. This seems to mean that independent dogs can’t be converted to the most affiliative of dogs simply by administering oxytocin. Thanks to differences in the ways they react to it physiologically, not all dogs (or all breeds) experience the same effect.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nA 2017 study(Oxytocin and Opioid Receptor Gene Polymorphisms Associated with Greeting Behavior in Dogs) found that variations in the receptor genes for oxytocin were related to dogs’ willingness to greet unfamiliar people. In German Shepherds, the form of the gene that an individual dog possessed was an excellent predictor of how friendly that dog was toward people. A similar trend — though not conclusive — occurred in Border Collies. (The pattern did not hold in Siberian Huskies.)\nInanother 2017 studythat explored the role of oxytocin on social behavior (Endogenous Oxytocin, Vasopressin, and Aggression in Domestic Dogs), researchers compared its levels in dogs bred to work as assistance dogs to its levels in pet dogs. The assistance dogs were from a population that has been bred for more than 40 years for traits such as friendliness, calm temperaments and the lack of aggressive behavior. At the physiological level, these dogs had higher oxytocin levels when compared to pet dogs, suggesting that the selective breeding of these dogs may have acted on their oxytocin levels, and that changes in the levels of the hormone may also influence the likelihood of aggressive behavior.\nThe science is clear\nThat dogs have such a profound influence on our lives is not news to anybody, but their effects on our physiology continue to make headlines. Petting our dogs can increase our oxytocin levels (and theirs!); even thinking about our dogs can make them rise. Having our dogs on our mind when life gets rough may be a good idea because oxytocin can reduce stress, increase pain tolerance and enhance well-being.\nWith its reputation as the “feel-good hormone,” it’s no surprise that oxytocin figures heavily into our relationship with dogs. We’ve learned much about its effects on both species, and new research will surely reveal even more about its relevance to the bond we share. For now, we can summarize what’s known by saying that if you’re convinced that the chemistry between you and your dog is real, science definitely has your back.",

Handling them takes them away from their heat source (their mom) and opportunities to feed as they nurse about every two hours in the newborn phase.\nIt’s likeWhat to Expect When You’re Expecting, except add“four little paws to run around your house”to the title.\nThree to eight weeks\nPuppies in this stage begin exploring. Their eyes are now open, and they can hear, too. These senses were beginning to work sometime in week two or three but are now more functional and influence their behavior more. During this stage, puppies move around on their own a lot and play with their littermates.\nAround week five or six, the way they play can look alarmingly rough. More than one person has feared they have a litter full of “aggressive” puppies, when that was not the case.\nContinue to let them be with their littermates and mother. It is critically important they are together; the puppies learn important lessons during their interactions that are very difficult to learn otherwise. They learn toinhibit their biteand how to start and end play with other dogs, as well as many other social skills, which is why puppies taken from their mother and littermates when they are only five or six weeks old (or even earlier, though that is less common), are more likely to be aggressive to other dogs. They are also at risk of biting too hard during play with other dogs and with people and to apply more pressure in an actual bite with either species as well.\nDuring this time, it’s good for people to handle them (but gently!). They should begin to meet all kinds of people — men, women, children, people of different races and genders, and those who move in different ways, including with a cane, a walker, or a wheelchair.\nAs you begin to teach them where the bathroom is, considerwherethey are doing their business. Puppies learn very early on, even at eight weeks, where to potty and are often loyal to that surface. So, if their guardian can find grass or dirt or leaves for them to use, that will make it easier to house train them later than if they go on carpet or on towels now.\nIf it’s time for a round of shots (no, not that kind), follow this guide.\nEight to 16 weeks\nIt’s during this period, usually at the very beginning, that dogs typically go to their new home, so it’s a time of transitions. A puppy might be a little bit different for the first few days to a week or so in your home because they are adjusting. Some dogs don’t act differently after a brief time settling in, so don’t be surprised either way.\nMany dogs go through a bit of a fear period in the early weeks of this stage, so your puppy’s confidence will experience a slump and then grow as this stage progresses. In the early weeks, your puppy may cower or seek assurance from you, or vocalize in a distressed way when confronted with a loud truck, a person, an exuberant dog, or a box that was delivered on the front porch.\nAt this stage, puppies are extremely receptive to new experiences, and positive ones have a long-lasting effect on them. They are far more likely to accept new experiences, new situations, and new social partners later on in life if they have a lot of experiences and meet many social partners during this stage than if they are not exposed to much during this critical time. The socialization period for dogs is a window of time during which exposure to the big wide world sets them up for success.\nIt begins as early as three weeks, but the main socialization period for most new puppy parents is from eight weeks until well into their fourth month on the planet. The window for socialization does not close abruptly, but does so gradually.\nDuring this stage, puppies learn a lot, such as who their family is, who they can play with, where to pee and poop, what sound, sights and smells are normal, and how to respond to many cues. Expect a lot of attentiveness, a good amount of cuddling (but sometimes it doesn’t feel like enough!), wake-ups in the middle of the night for potty breaks, and probably some accidents in the house, though most dogs get a good handle on the general idea that the bathroom is outside during this time.\nAt the start of this phase, expectmaximumcuteness from your puppy. Astudy in 2018showed that people find puppies at around eight weeks of age to be the very cutest — more adorable than they are when younger or older. It’s a good thing, too, because when we are not getting enough sleep and putting in all the work to raise a young puppy, that peak cuteness helps our bodies produce chemicals that enhance our bonding and social connection to our puppies.\nMany people feel especially close to their puppy during this time because puppies at this age often want to be with them no matter where they go. It’s common for puppies of this age to follow you wherever you go even when not on a leash, and that makes being with them very special.\nPuppies in a new home need patience and gentleness as they make this big transition. During this stage, it’s important to spend lots of time with your puppy to help them with this major adjustment.\nIt’s essential to socialize puppies during this time. That means providing them lots of opportunities to meet other dogs, to meet people, and to go to new places, all in ways that make these positive experiences for your puppy. It’s essential that the exposure they have to aspects of their world are good experiences, so focus on that, instead of exposing them to as much as possible.\nBasically, consider this: If they meet people and other dogs and cats, hear the blender; the washing machine and loud trucks; walk on carpets and tile floors, grass, and rocks; go to new places and smell new things, and those experiences are pleasant for them, that’s wonderful. If they have a bad time, that’s counterproductive. Associating new experiences with treats and not forcing your puppy to be too close to anything they don’t choose to approach goes a long way. Apuppy class that focuses on socializationis a great option.These early weeks are a great time for training. Even young puppies can learn many basic skills such as to sit when they greet anyone or before they eat, to come when called, to be comfortable in a crate, to walk on a leash, the beginnings of a solid “stay,” to wait at the door, to touch a target, and so much more. They will need much more training throughout their life, but they can begin to learn basic skills, as well as learn that training can be fun because treats, toys, and attention are wonderful reinforcements for responding to cues.\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nFour months to one year\nAs puppies leave their socialization period behind, they head toward adolescence, which begins by six months of age and follows the pattern of adolescence everywhere. Puppies seek increased independence and explore more on their own and head further away from us than they used to. They become increasingly less attentive to us and sometimes seem not to hear us or notice us, even when we are giving cues they used to respond to reliably.\nPuppies at this stage need more activity than they used to and generally seem hungry for things to do, stimulation, and frequently for the company of other dogs and of people. Some of the activity they seek is chewing, as many puppies have what seems like a desperate need to chew, especially when they are in the range of eight to 10 months old, though that varies.\nAt some point in the second half of their first year of life, dogs typically enter a fear period. During this time, they will often react fearfully to things that didn’t used to bother them and to some new situations or objects as well. They will often seek comfort from you when they become overwhelmed by something in their world.\nProviding your dog with what they need at this stage is generally about offering them a lot of opportunities to engage with the world and protecting them from potential trouble in that world.\nTraining is a great way to engage your dog’s mind and work on your connection to each other. Lots of training — to state the obvious — also offers the incredible benefit of having a well-trained dog. It’s wise to train at home inside and outside, on walks, in the car, and everywhere you go. Classes are a great opportunity to offer new and stimulating experiences to your pup.\nContinue exposing your dog to new experiences, whether that means walking with another person and their dog, staying overnight with you at a relative’s house, going to dog-friendly shops and cafes, or moving your furniture around. More exploration of the world at parks, in a new neighborhood, or a dog training facility can be fun and stimulating for your dog.\nIn general, at this stage, it’s wise to avoid boredom or inactivity for your dog. In addition to training and exploring, it’s great to play with your dog and to have other people play with your dog. Set up playdates for your dog with dogs of various ages and types who have good social skills and like to play with young dogs. Monitor the play to make sure they are playing appropriately and that everyone is having a good time.\nOffer your dog food puzzles to keep them busy when you are otherwise occupied. It’s helpful to feed your dog in a way that takes effort for them rather than just in a bowl. That way, feeding itself is an enriching activity. Chew toys are essential for many dogs at this stage, so provide them regularly and often. It‘s far better to give them items that aremeantto be chewed on than to have an adolescent dog seeking them out and finding shoes, furniture, or kitchen utensils to satisfy their need to chew.\nDon’t worry; it’s just a phase!\nBe mindful of dangers to your dog that were not an issue when they were young and tended to stick close by you, or only wandered slowly away. As dogs get faster and more independent, it is crucial to protect them from going into the road or running up to other dogs.\nThose experiences can be traumatizing and dangerous. As predictable as these risks are, they can take people by surprise if they forget their puppies are changing and don’t stick right by them like before. Keep them safe, and don’t give them too much freedom — especially because dogs at this age are likely to be less responsive to cues than they used to be. Don’t count on them to respond to being called to come as they did when they were younger and like they will again when they are older (if you keep up on your training, that is!).\nHelp them and comfort them when they are afraid. If they react in a fearful way, the best approach is to stay calm, get them out of the situation, and comfort them. Help them overcome their fears by not coercing them into a situation that is too much for them, and by gradually exposing them to a minor version of what scares them while associating it with truly delicious treats or play.\nSo, if men start to seem scary to them, have a man toss your dog treats or a ball, depending on what makes your dog happiest. If the fear is of dumpsters, for example, offer your dog a treat every time you see one from a distance. Over time, you can approach more closely, but keep offering treats in that context.\nOne year to two years\nThey are not technically puppies after a year, but they are not adults until closer to age two, so this phase is still part of their development. Anything that happens during this time influences their behavior and their emotions in adulthood.\nHow to get your pet to stop chewing on inedibles from clothes to couches.\nPups at this age tend to have high energy demands. They are likely to be able to play or walk or hike for long time periods, rest only briefly, and be ready to go again with great enthusiasm. They are likely to have an interest in all kinds of activities:  games,food puzzles, training, sports, and more. Throughout this stage, dogs gradually increase their attentiveness and are less likely to seem distracted or ignore you.\nDuring this time, dogs require a lot of activity, and a major part of being their parent at this time is providing it. They need lots of exercise, so running, fetching, tugging, and hiking are wonderful opportunities to spend time with your dog and meeting their needs.\nEnrichment is so important throughout dogs’ lives, and now is the time they are likely to enjoy all kinds of it. Everything from frozen Kongs to opportunities to dig to attending a training class, picking up dog sports like agility and dock diving, or doing nose work will help make your dog’s life full and keep their brain and body busy.\nLots of training is a great way to spend time with your dog and engage their interest and attention. Because dogs at this age are better able to pay attention, it’s a great time to work on all kinds of skills. Recalls, stays, tricks, targeting, sit and down, wait at the door, “leave it” — all these skills are ones that make life a little easier and more fun for both of you. Training classes are a great option, thoughtraining every daya little bit here and there is essential if you want your dog to truly master these skills.\nMany dogs relax and will have a quick rest after some training. Additionally, training makes it easier to take your dog on outings or have people over — both good ways to make your dog’s life more fun and full of interest.\nThose little razor teeth are no fun.\n“Enjoy them at whatever stage they’re in”\nI have complained many times to my wonderful mother-in-law that when all my friends tell mother-in-law horror stories, I have nothing to share. Luckily, though, I can still write about her because she gave me some of the best advice I’ve ever received. She told me, “Enjoy your children at whatever stage they’re in,” and it’s good advice for raising dogs, too. It’s just a little easier to enjoy each stage if you know what to expect and what to do.\nReferences:\nDog Pups’ Attractiveness to Humans Peaks at Weaning Age",

They may just be acting a little wacky (dogs, like people, are known to do that from time to time). But they may also be in pain. Here are things to look for if you think that may be the case.\nBlue is a good name for a dog—not a good mood.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nSigns your dog might be in pain\nPain in dogs can be obvious or subtle. A common phone call that veterinary offices receive goes something like this:  “I’m worried that my dog is in pain.” He’s eating and drinking, but he just seems down and isn’t acting like himself. I don’t know how to tell where my dog is painful, and I don't want to hurt him trying to find out.”\nFiguring out if and where your dog hurts can be difficult, even for vets. In my experience, dogs try to hide their signs of pain, especially when they’re anxious or afraid. This can make localizing pain a challenge during visits to the vet clinic, but veterinarians can often spot subtle indicators of pain even in stoic dogs. If you’re not sure if your dog is in pain, look for some indicators like:\nYou know what your dog’s “normal”  looks like: their ritual around pooping and peeing, which beds they like to lay in, if they curl up or stretch out, and how much they follow you around from room to room. Pain can disrupt their routine, so any behavior that’s out of the norm should raise a red flag. Even small things like not jumping on the couch, not crunching on food like usual, or not begging for snacks can indicate a problem.\nDecreased activity and withdrawal from people and other pets are common signs of pain in dogs. Dogs who are hurting don’t want to be jostled or made to move around, so they’lloften hide awayto be left in peace. This means that pain or discomfort should be a top concern when you find your dog tucked away in a closet or under a bed. Unless they just won’t budge, don’t try to force your dog to relocate by pulling them or picking them up — coax them with a favorite treat or toy instead. This allows your dog to move at their own pace and in a way that minimizes pain.\nWe’ve all heard ourdogs sighlike the weight of the world is on their shoulders. I’m sure laying around all day, investigating interesting smells, and monitoring squirrel activity are all very taxing, but the discontented grumbles can be a little much for a family member that doesn’t help pay the bills. Painful dogs often make sounds that go beyond their normal world-weary exhalations. Dogs may try to communicate pain by whining, growling, yipping, or barking.\nSome painful dogs make a constant,high-pitched whineor whimper, while others only vocalize when they anticipate pain or have a sudden spike of pain. Growling can be a warning that you’re approaching a painful area. It’s best not to force the issue and back off. Even the friendliest dogs can lash out when they’re in pain.\nSome of the more obvious signs of pain in a dog are limping and difficulty walking. Limps can be obvious (holding a leg up all the time) or subtle (a head bob when putting weight on the painful limb). It’s very common for pet parents to recognize that their dog’s gait is off but not know exactly what leg is causing the problem. It’s not always easy for vets either. I’ve definitely had to watch dogs with a mild limp walk up and down a hallway multiple times to figure out where the problem is.\nOther physical symptoms of pain can include trembling, changes in posture, and stiffness. Trembling is easy to pick up on and is often accompanied by a woe-is-me facial expression. Changes in posture may not always be obvious, but some common signs include:\nPutting less weight on one limb when standing still\nPutting less weight on one limb when standing still\nArched back\nArched back\nLow head carriage\nLow head carriage\nTail tucked or held low\nTail tucked or held low\nNeck turned to one side\nNeck turned to one side\nA dog in pain will often appear very stiff and slow to move. This is especially common with back and abdominal pain.\nPainful dogs should be approached with caution becausethey will guardpainful areas.  Even though you’re trying to help, your dog may not perceive you reaching for their ouch-y area as an attempt at aid. Dogs will often try to move painful areas out of your reach, curling away from contact and the risk of more pain. They may even growl or raise their hackles to give a warning that they don’t appreciate your attempts at assisting them.\nCommon causes of pain in dogs\nDogs can be painful for many reasons. Sometimes you’ll know the cause immediately because you witnessed your dog run headfirst into a trailer hitch while fetching a ball. Sometimes signs of pain take a while to show up, and you have to think back to what you did yesterday to figure out what could have caused it. Other times, there’s no obvious trigger and you’re just stuck with a mystery.\nWhen I’m presented with a dog that seems painful, I think about a few common causes, such as:\nOrthopedic injuries: sprains, strains, fractures\nOrthopedic injuries: sprains, strains, fractures\nDental pain: fractured teeth, dental infections\nDental pain: fractured teeth, dental infections\nSpinal pain: ruptured discs, meningitis\nSpinal pain: ruptured discs, meningitis\nInfections: ear infections, urinary tract infections, abscesses\nInfections: ear infections, urinary tract infections, abscesses\nChronic conditions:arthritis, lumbosacral disease, cancer\nChronic conditions:arthritis, lumbosacral disease, cancer\nGastrointestinal conditions: intestinal foreign bodies, pancreatitis, bloating, constipation\nGastrointestinal conditions: intestinal foreign bodies, pancreatitis, bloating, constipation\nWounds: Cuts, scrapes,broken toenails\nWounds: Cuts, scrapes,broken toenails\nHow to diagnose pain in dogs\nIt can be tempting to try to figure out why your dog is in pain at home. While it may give you a clue about the cause, you shouldn’t push it if your dog is giving you warning signs that they’re not up for the process. One big benefit of visiting your vet is that they have injectable pain medications available that can make your dog less stressed and more comfortable quickly.\nIf your dog allows it, you can do a gentle once-over at home to see if there’s an obvious, fixable cause for their pain. Sometimes you’ll find an acorn shell lodged between their foot pads and get to be your dog’s savior for the day. Being calm, systematic, and intentional in your approach can help put your dog at ease and make things easier for you. Steps to figuring out if your dog is in pain and where the pain is coming from include:\nNote changes in your dog’s eating, drinking, or bathroom habits. Is your dog suddenly squatting when they're usually a leg lifter? Are they slow to get up or lay down? Do they hesitate to jump on the couch or hop up for attention? Are they able to lay in their usual place and position?\nAnswering all of these questions can help tell you if your dog is in pain, but it probably won’t give you a definitive answer. Some dogs with these symptoms may have a systemic disease that causes general malaise that can look similar to signs of pain.\nFinding the source of discomfort can confirm that your dog is truly in pain, but it comes with some risks. Localizing pain often involves touching or moving the painful area. This can sometimes provoke aggressive reactions or cause your dog to be afraid of you. It’s fine if you’re not feeling up to examining your dog for painful areas; no one wants to cause their canine companion pain. I recently took my own dog to see another veterinarian when he was showing signs ofspinal pain— I suspected his back hurt, but didn’t want to be the one to poke and prod to find out for sure.\nIf you’re feeling brave and your dog is tolerant, you can try to do abasic examinationto check for obvious causes of pain. Look for cuts, discharge, blood, swollen areas, and obvious injuries. Run your hands gently over your dog’s limbs, back, neck, abdomen, and chest to feel for warm spots, lumps, or tender areas. If your dog is limping, check their feet for foreign objects stuck between their toes.\nIf you’re concerned your dog is in pain and either don’t feel comfortable or are unable to find the source of pain, see your vet. Your vet can examine your dog fully to check for common causes of pain,give them pain medicationsif needed, and do additional diagnostics like radiographs (X-rays) to determine why your dog is in pain.\nSafe pain-relief options for dogs\nWhether you find the exact cause of your dog’s pain or not, getting the pain under control is a priority. Don’t rush to give your dog the same medications you take for pain though. Dogs can’t handle many common human pain medications and can even develop significant problems if they’re given. Some safe pain relief options for dogs include:\nThese medications would be administered by your vet during an office visit. Depending on your dog’s level of pain, they can include narcotics like butorphanol and hydromorphone or initial doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like carprofen.\nYour veterinarian mayprescribe an oralNSAID like carprofen, meloxicam, or grapiprant to help relieve pain. These drugs are commonly used for orthopedic conditions and back pain, but they may not be safe for dogs with certain liver orkidney issues. Alternative drugs may be prescribed instead of or in addition to NSAIDs. Drugs like gabapentin and tramadol have less evidence supporting their effectiveness in dogs but are generally considered safe options.\nSupplementslikeglucosamine and chondroitin sulfatefor joint health may help with the progression of the chronic pain of arthritis, but don’t do anything for acute pain. Once the source of your dog’s pain is found, your veterinarian may recommendholistic pain relieftherapy including physical therapy, massage, or acupuncture. For many acutely painful orthopedic conditions, activity restriction is a major part of recovery. Keeping calm and rested is easier for some dogs than others.\nAvoid giving dogs over-the-counter pain medications, including drugs like “doggie aspirin” that are marketed for pets. Dogs have a significant risk of developing stomach ulcers, kidney injury, or liver issues when taking these drugs.Reaching for these medicationswill likely do more harm than good, and giving them can cause drug interactions that limit the safe, effective options available for your dog. Acetaminophen may be used for dogs under veterinary guidance in some situations, but the dose and risks need to be calculated precisely.\nWhen to consult a vet\nIt’s sometimes tough to know when your dog is being dramatic and when a vet visit would really help them. For dogs that have mild signs of pain like a slight lameness, watchful waiting for a day or two can be OK, provided they’re not showing any other symptoms. Always take your dog to the vet for a consult if you’re concerned about them, or if they’re showing any of these signs:\nObvious deformities (fractures, dislocations)\nObvious deformities (fractures, dislocations)\nOpen wounds\nOpen wounds\nNot putting weight on a limb\nNot putting weight on a limb\nInability to walk\nInability to walk\nMild pain that’s worsening or not resolving after a couple of days of rest\nMild pain that’s worsening or not resolving after a couple of days of rest\nNot wanting to get up\nNot wanting to get up\nDecreased appetite or thirst\nDecreased appetite or thirst\nUnsteady gait\nUnsteady gait\nSudden changes in behavior\nSudden changes in behavior\nSeizures\nSeizures\nAggression\nAggression\nFrequent vocalization\nFrequent vocalization\nHeavy breathing\nHeavy breathing\nAbdominal pain or swelling\nAbdominal pain or swelling\nInability to urinate or defecate\nInability to urinate or defecate\nBottom line\nSymptoms of pain can be subtle in dogs, but observing their behavior and routines can help you recognize the signs. If your dog allows it, you can try to find the source of pain at home, but the best bet is usually to have your vet check for problems. Whatever you do, don’t ignore persistent, worsening, or moderate-to-severe pain — get your dog to the vet, so they can start feeling better quickly.\nYou can’t appease your picky new dog with chicken nuggets like you can with your toddler.

  "page_content": "What would happen if a dog got hold of the magic mirror fromSnow White? Would their vanity be exposed? Would they develop an obsession over who was the furriest in all the land? The cutest? The friendliest?\nFirst of all, every dog is the best dog (obviously) and we don’t need some stupid mirror getting in everyone’s head and telling us otherwise. But studies exploring cognition, self-awareness, and intelligence in animals — including dogs — have used mirrors to learn about animal minds.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWe know dogs are social and that they recognize individuals. They havegood dog buddiesthey see and get excited about. They know their own family, and the family friend who always sneaks them extra treats. They are capable of identifying people and dogs. Aretheyone of the dogs they can identify? In other words, if they look into the mirror, do they recognize themselves?\nThis study findsthat dogs can process numbers in a similar fashion to their humans.\nDo mirrors reveal an animal’s sense of self?\nThe most common test of self-recognition is themirror test: Mirrors are powerful tools for psychological study. If an animal recognizes that the reflection is themself, they are said to have the ability of self-recognition. One common way to test for this is to put some sort of color on them with a dye or a sticker on a body part they can’t see, such as the forehead. Then, scientists watch how they respond to seeing themselves (and the new mark) in the mirror.\nIf they touch the mark on their body, that suggests they recognize that what they are seeing is themselves, rather than another animal. If they see the mark and reach forthemselvesrather than the image in the mirror to investigate the mark, that’s evidence of self-recognition. Animals, such as chimpanzees and dolphins, recognize themselves in the mirror. When they see themselves reflected, they understand the image they see is their own.\nPeople do this, too. When I pop into the restroom, look in the mirror, and see my hair sticking up in a way that would cause my hair stylist to deny I am her client, I know it’s me staring back in horror. I can do my best to fix this grooming error because Irecognize myself. Because self-recognition is so simple for humans, we may not realize that doing so is a very specific skill and far from universal. Of the many animalstested for self-recognitionwith the mirror test, only a few succeeded.\nHow the mirror test (literally) reflects intelligence.\nChimpanzees, dolphins, and orcas — intelligent animals — were among the first to be studied and succeed at the mirror test. Animals who don’t pass the test include some monkeys, pandas, parrots, and sea lions — animals who are considered less intelligent. Many people believe that “passing” the mirror test is a sign of high intelligence. In fact, it’s a common opinion that the divide between those who pass the mirror test and those who don’t is the division between animals with high intelligence and animals without it.\nWe knowdogs are intelligent animalswhose brain power allows them to do all kinds of things. These are amazing animals who can understand hundreds of words, respond to human gestures, and distinguish between helpful and non-helpful humans. They are capable of deception, problem-solving, and understanding that someone else needs help and seeking that help from others. Dogs were an obvious species to study with the mirror test, and many people had high hopes they would pass it with ease.\nIf you’ve ever watched dogs try to fight, play with, or act terrified of their own reflection in a mirror, you will not be surprised by the research showing that dogs don’t seem to recognize themselves in the mirror. But we know that the more we study dogs, the more we learn about their intelligence and their advanced cognitive abilities. What does their inability to recognize themselves in the mirror say about their intelligence? Not much, it turns out.\nResearchers say dogs actually have a pretty good sense of what we’re thinking.\nThere are problems with the mirror test.\nThe use of the mirror test as a definitive way to assess an animal’s ability to recognize themselves is problematic. Many animals may react aggressively to their reflection, which prevents them from calmly considering the reflection and figuring out what it actually is. That may explain the failure of gorillas to pass the mirror test. Another issue is that many animals, including some monkeys, may not care about the mark they see on the reflection and investigate it because they don’t groom themselves. That makes it unlikely they would react to a mark on their body by paying attention to it, poking at it, or attempting to remove it.\nThe mirror test also favors those animals who interact with the world in a primarily visual way. Dogs are not in that favored group because they understand the world by processing it with their noses far more than they do by processing it with their eyes. They are among the animals who don’t engage in much self-grooming, so expecting them to see something that doesn’t belong on their fur such as a sticker, dye, or paint mark doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. Additionally, looking at a mirror and seeing what looks like another dog but has no scent could freak a dog out and cause them to become alarmed.\nThere are many reasons why certain species or individuals don’t pass the mirror test, and they must be considered on a case-by-case basis. Creative thinking about each test subject can be revealing. For example, my husband and his identical twin frequently saw themselves in the mirror when someone was holding them up high enough to see into the mirror, but my mother-in-law only realized later that they each thought they were seeing their brother.\nOnly at the age of three or four years old did they both happen to be in front of a large full-length mirror at the same time. The presence of their two reflections in the mirror while they stood side by side apparently came as quite a shock to them. Their inability to recognize themselves in the mirror until that moment had nothing to do with intelligence and everything to do with their unusual life experiences compared to those without an identical twin, which is obviously most people.\nThe yellow-snow test beats the mirror test for dogs.\nMarc Bekoff, PhD, studied his own dog’s response to “urine-saturated snow” (yellow snow) that he had moved from place to place. Over four winters, Bekoff recorded how his dog, Jethro, reacted to yellow snow from other dogs and from Jethro himself. The short summary is that Jethro reacted differently to his own pee than he did to the pee of other dogs. Specifically, Jethro spent less time sniffing his own pee than he spent sniffing the pee of other dogs. He was far more likely to pee over the urine of other dogs, than to pee over his own urine, which he only did rarely. During the course of the study, he continued to be interested in pee from other dogs, but the interest he had in his own declined.\nBekoff’s study caught many people’s attention because it showed that one dog, Jethro (a mixed breed who is part German Shepherd, part Rottweiler) can recognize his own pee, suggesting that he has a sense of self. Observations of the behavior of a single dog, however, aren’t enough to make sweeping scientific claims about dogs in general.\nResearch finds that your pup can smell when you’ve been doom-scrolling, and they get bummed out.\nThere have been other olfactory-based studies of self-recognition in dogs.\nAdditional studies have found that dogs pay more attention to pee from other dogs than from their own pee, suggesting they are able to recognize the pee as their own and that they have a sense of self. As dogs use pee to learn about the age, health, stress levels, reproduction status etc., of fellow dogs, it makes sense that their own pee is less interesting — they already know who they are and have little to learn by sniffing their own pee.\nIn a series of studies,Alexandra Horowitz, PhD, measured how long dogs sniffed different pee samples. The length of time they sniff is assumed to be a measure of their interest in it. They sniffed pee from other dogs longer than they sniffed their own pee, as previous researchers had also observed. Horowitz also modified the pee by adding an additional odor to it — essential anise oil.\nShe described the test as an olfactory mirror test because just like the image in the mirror has something that didn’t belong (the mark), the pee in her study had something added that didn’t belong (an extra odor.) She wanted to know whether dogs would investigate this “marked” pee just as chimpanzees investigate the mark on their fur.\nIt’s not exactly analogous, because in the mirror test, both the reflection and the animal have a mark, but in this pee test, there is modified and unmodified pee. When their own pee was modified by having anise oil added to it, they spent more time sniffing it than when it was the same old pee. To check whether a simple interest in something new explained the dogs’ extended interest in the modified pee, she also gave them the opportunity to sniff the new odor alone. They weren’t that interested in the odor used to modify their pee when it was presented by itself, so an interest in the odor just because it was novel doesn’t explain the dog’s interest in modified versions of their own pee.\nTime to whip outThe Notebookfor a little doggie movie night.\nIn conclusion: the mirror test isn’t the best way to measure self-recognition in every species.\nThough dogs failed the self-recognition mirror test, other evidence points to them being able to recognize themselves. This reveals two challenges with studying self-recognition in animals. One, just because a particular study doesn’t show that animals can recognize themselves, we can’t rule out the possibility that the test failed the animals rather than the other way around. Two, finding the right situation that allows animals to show their ability to recognize themselves requires an understanding of the species’ natural behavior. That is, scientists must take into account that dogs are far more likely to “look into” the pee around them than they are to look into a mirror.\nReferences:\nObservations of Scent-Marking and Discriminating Self From Others by a Domestic Dog (Canis Familiaris): Tales of Displaced Yellow Snow\nObservations of Scent-Marking and Discriminating Self From Others by a Domestic Dog (Canis Familiaris): Tales of Displaced Yellow Snow\nSmelling Themselves: Dogs Investigate Their Own Odours Longer When Modified in an “Olfactory Mirror” Test\nSmelling Themselves: Dogs Investigate Their Own Odours Longer When Modified in an “Olfactory Mirror” Test\nSelf-Consciousness: Beyond the Looking-Glass and What Dogs Found There\nSelf-Consciousness: Beyond the Looking-Glass and What Dogs Found There",

  "page_content": "You’re watching your dog play with their best buddy, enjoying this balm for the soul, when suddenly, you hear a louda-choo! It’s your dog, who you definitely don’t think is sick. But for the 100th time, you wonder if your dog really does sneeze during play as a regular thing. Or, are you just noticing it because you pay so much attention to every little thing your dog does in play?\nLike so many questions you can ask about dog behavior, a fair answer to whether dogs sneeze when they play is “yes and no.” And, like so many answers to questions about dog behavior, there’s a lot of explanation necessary to make the answer even remotely useful.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nIn this case, that’s because many dogs do something in play that is not entirely unlike a sneeze. It’s often referred to as a sneeze, even if it’s not the real deal. So, it’s not technically right to call it that, but most people will know what you mean when you talk about sneezes in play.\nTwo animal behavior experts agree it’s usuallyplay fighting. Here’s how you can tell.\nWhatisa sneeze, then?\nA true dog sneeze, just like a human sneeze, is involuntary. They are the body’s way of clearing stuff out of the nose that should not be in it. When I say “stuff,” I mean dust, pollen, smoke, and other small things that irritate the lining of the nasal cavity.\nA sneeze is a rapid expulsion of air through the nose and mouth because of irritation of the inside of the nose. Dogs can sometimes have real sneezes during play because of dust or other gunk being kicked up during play, but sneezing when playing in that way doesn’t make it a play-sneeze. Everybody clear?\nWhat is it if it’s not a sneeze?\nThe sneeze-like action so frequently observed in play is a bit more like a snort, though it is usually referred to as a sneeze (not quite accurate) or a play-sneeze (better, but still possibly confusing.) The sneezes dogs let out when they are playing often aren’t as explosive as sneezes that are caused by irritants in the dog’s nose.\nThere’s a lot of variation, but in general, play-sneezes are a bit gentler and based closer to the front of their face rather than involving the entire nose, mouth, and throat. They are generally a bit airier, and fainter in their sound compared with a full-bodied sneeze. They have a more shush-y quality than an explosive one.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nSo, whyaredogs sneezing when they play?\nThe short answer to why dogs sneeze when they play is that we don’t know because there have not been studies of this behavior. We’re still at the exploratory stage of learning about sneezing during play, which is kind of exciting, really.\nI’m all for gathering scientific data, but when it comes to animal behavior, good research so often begins with people observing what animals do, asking questions about it, and trying to figure out what’s going on. They come up with ideas (hypotheses) about what is happening and why, and they keep making observations. For behavior geeks like me, watching animals and seeking to find patterns in their behavior is the height of fun.\nI’ve watched dogs sneeze in play for decades and long pondered the purpose and meaning of this behavior. I recently asked some of my certified applied animal behaviorist (CAAB) colleagues about sneezing, and I’m eager to share their thoughts and ideas about play-sneezing in dogs.\nAnimal behavior experts weigh in on sneezing dogs.\nKristina Spaulding, author ofThe Stress Factor in Dogs: Unlocking Resiliency and Enhancing Well-Being) notes, “I have observed sneezing (snort-sneezing? sneerting?) in a couple of other contexts. Both of my dogs used to sneeze during training — specifically obedience/rally training, which is interesting, since although I believe they really enjoyed it, it seems pretty far removed from play. My current Australian Shepherd will sneeze when greeting people he really likes.”\n(I like the term “sneerting” so much I’m using it from now on!)\nJody Epsteinshares her views on this sneezing behavior: She interprets it as a social solicitation — which may be play or pets/sweet talk (with humans).“My Terrier mix will sneeze/snort when greeting people he likes. My recently passed Chow mix would sneeze when soliciting play/interaction. He’d stare at me, head down a little, like stalking, and then sneeze to get my attention if I wasn’t looking at him. I’ve seen many client dogs and dogs in play groups sneeze/snort as both initial solicitation as well as throughout play.”\nLillian Ciardellialso has a “sneerting” Aussie: “He sneezes both to me and other dogs during play. It seems to occur when play escalates in intensity. He also sneezes when he bonks into something (not an infrequent occurrence) and shakes his head, but that’s probably more of the reflex version.”\nPamela Reid, head of the Behavioral Sciences Team with the ASPCA, has noticed a link between a specific type of play and this sneezing behavior, “At least with my dogs, the snorting/sneezing stuff tends to happen most often when they are playing bite-y face [play involving playful bites to each other’s head and neck]. They pull their lips back to expose their teeth, thereby scrunching up their noses,” suggesting that perhaps the type of play is responsible, at least in part, for physically causing the sneezing.\nSuzanne Hetts, author of12 Terrible Dog Training Mistakes Owners Make That Ruin Their Dog's Behavior...And How To Avoid Them) has observed a slightly different situation, still involving play, in which dogs sneeze.\n“I’ve seen the sneezing when it seems one or both dogs are wanting to end a play session — the one who is done sneezes/snorts, if the other one agrees s/he returns the snort and the play bout ends,” she says. “If she/he wants to continue playing she doesn’t sneeze and then shows a play behavior.”\nHetts’s observations indicate that sneezing can be a form of deliberate communication between dogs and also a way that a dog seeks to communicate with people about what they want: “I’ve also seen it when one of my dogs would come up and bark or paw or just stare at me, clearly wanting something (outside, play, attention, a walk, whatever), and I’d say something like, ‘Not right now’ or ‘Just wait a minute,’ which would be followed by a snort/sneeze.”\nLili Chin’s bookDoggie Languageillustrates how dogs communicate — beyond ear perks and tail wags.\nOther animal species sneeze even when their noses aren’t irritated.\nDogs aren’t the only animals who sneeze in situations, other than clearing something from their noses. One example of sneezes as a form of communication comes from African wild dogs. Scientists have observed them wander around an area where the pack has been resting. After this period of milling around, sometimes they leave to go on a hunt, and sometimes they go back to chilling out and resting.\nResearchers interested in the decision-making process of the group made an astonishing discovery: African wild dogs sneeze to vote about what they should do. A sneeze is a vote to get a move on and start hunting. If the pack has enough dogs in it who sneeze, they will move, and if there are not too many sneezes, the pack of dogs stays put. Horses also sneeze for reasons beyond having dust up their noses (though they do that, too!)\nSue McDonnell, a professor atHavemeyer Equine Behavior Labof Penn Vet, University of Pennsylvania, explains: “In horses, there is what seems to be an analogous ‘soft longish snort-snuffle-like’ forceful exhalation associated with the resolution phase of a burst of high-level excitement, whether positive or negative … So, in horses these sounds occur in a lot of situations ... [including] during play bouts after a burst of intense action rolls into more quiet play, as an inter-male aggressive encounter quiets, after an acute painful moment, and even during training.”\nHow to tell the difference between dog aggression and communication.\nThere are so many ideas about play-sneezing.\nA lot of dog behavior experts, as well as expert dog lovers and parents, have observed play-sneezes and come up with ideas about what might be going on. The topicabsolutelybegs for proper research.\nThere are many possibilities that require scientific study to sort out, and it’s very likely that more than one of these ideas are true. Different dogs may sneeze for different reasons and in different situations.\nFor now, some of the main theories are that dogs sneeze:\nDue to excitement during play or in greetings\nDue to excitement during play or in greetings\nBecause of high-arousal situations in general\nBecause of high-arousal situations in general\nTo indicate they want some kind of interaction\nTo indicate they want some kind of interaction\nTo communicate whether or not they want to continue playing\nTo communicate whether or not they want to continue playing\nTo encourage others to calm down\nTo encourage others to calm down\nBecause of physical contact with their nose\nBecause of physical contact with their nose\nWhen you watch your dogs play, do they sneeze?

  },
  "page_content": "Outside of maybe DMX, people rarely encourage dog barking. Depending on the deepness of their vocals, a canine’s trademark woof can inspire anything from eye rolls to migraines to the most effectively timed jump scare this side of a Blumhouse production.\nOf course, there’s a good reason why pet parents are having their work, sleep, or brief moments of peace interrupted by these howls: They’re a dog’s best form of communication. It’s also why the trend of anti-bark devices has raised more than a few eyebrows in expert circles.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThese gadgets, likethis one, work by releasing a high-pitched noise to deter dogs from barking. The idea is when you click the device, it’ll communicate to them to stop. That might seem harmless enough, but considering these devices resemble those used forultrasonic repellent on mice, it’sprobablya bad look to use them. Plus, that’s the samelogic behind shock collars.\nBarking devices can actually cause more problems.\nTrainerJennifer Malaweyadds that these tools are not only uncomfortable for our pups, but they may create a laundry list of behavioral issues. “Any time we use an unpleasant stimulus to change behavior, we risk a long list of undesirable consequences,” she explains.\nMalawey warns that new fear, anxiety, and aggression unrelated to the original barking can develop causing additional problems for your pup and wallet. “This can, of course, come with liability and further costs for veterinary and behavior professionals. Meanwhile, the dog’s emotional health and quality of life may suffer as well.”\nOffering fewer treats can actually be agoodthing.\nProponents of these tools might argue that the noise isn’t enough to warrant such concern; it’s just a means of communicating back with their animal. These pet parents could claim that they’ve witnessed firsthand that the devices are effective in causing pets to stop barking. They may even suggest that they live in a loud city or listen to a lot of screamo music so their dog is used to hearing high-pitched squeals.\nAccording to Malawey, it doesn’t really matter if the device is physically hurtful or merely irritating for dogs. Any noticeable response is cause for concern in this area. “If it causes an animal to stop doing a behavior, however, it’s actually not relevant whether it was annoying or painful or somewhere in between,” she says. “If it was uncomfortable enough to change the behavior, it comes with risk of fallout.”\nWhy it’s best to avoid these altogether.\nThese devices are unpleasant, at best, for dogs.\nCofounder ofDogboy NYCand Kinship Collective memberRobert Haussmannconfirms that pet parents should generally avoid any training method enlisting punishment onto an animal.\n“I don’t pretend to know what an animal is experiencing. It becomes clear, however, that it is unpleasant,” says. “Often times unpleasant enough to send the dog cowering away shaking.”\nOutside of the discomfort they cause, Haussmann notes that anti-bark devices are rarely effective in altering behavior long-term. He explains that for some dogs, these doodads may cause frustration or excessive fear while causing no reaction whatsoever in others. Another common response pet parents witness when using anti-bark devices is their pups simply running into another room — where the machine might not be able to pick up the sound — to do their barking.\nMalawey cautions that this action is a warning sign of a larger issue developing and reflective of the device’s overall misuse. “That dog’s reaction — running to another room — tells us that that dog found it unpleasant enough to motivate him to escape the sound. If that were my dog, I’d be very concerned by that and would discontinue use immediately,” she says.\nYoucanlive in a quiet house again.\nAnd it probably won’t work in the long run anyway.\nBeyond being potentially cruel, both experts agree that anti-bark devices won’t be effective long-term because they focus solely on the act of barking rather than what inspired it.\n“It’s important to recognize that these devices are designed to punish a symptom, not address the root cause of the symptom,” Haussmann explains. “Until the cause is addressed, the behavior will likely continue or spill over into some equivalent or more problematic behavior.“\nFor Malawey, it all comes back to the fact that dogs bark as a means of communication. It happens for a plethora of reasons, none of which should be ignored: “It’s hard to address allforms of barking with a simple button.”\nNone of this is to minimize the struggle of pet parents trying to reduce barking. Malawey admits it’s a challenge she’s dealt with with her own pups and says she’s empathetic to the process. But ultimately, barking is necessary for our dogs and their ability to express themselves and their needs.\nIt’s better to identify the cause of barking — and go from there with training.\nAccording to Malawey and Haussmann, the most effective method of curbing excessive barking is to identify and address what’s inspiring it. “The starting point is always sleuthing out whyyour dog is barking. Context matters. Are they frightened? Are they excited? Are they bored? The solution will vary depending on what’s inspiring the barking,” Malawey says.\nHaussmann adds that all dog behavior follows a similar sequence, with a cause preceding the consequence (barking). As the pro puts it, “Trying to change the consequence with punishment is a bit clumsy and can quickly drift into something inhumane.”\nInstead, he recommends zeroing in on the cause before working to change the dog’s emotional association to what is causing the barking in the first place. “For instance, if a dog barks at people passing from a window, using a gate to prevent the dog from getting to that window could be a great solution. This could be in place while you work on a behavior plan to change the dog’s perception of the people passing,” he says.\nIt’s the saddest sound in the world.\nMalawey suggests that this form of environmental management could also include visual barriers, such as using window frosting or closing the shades. She also recommends audio masking, which would involve playing music or just keeping a fan on for white noise. Routine adjustments, such as walking your dog during less busy hours and limiting their unsupervised yard access, could go a long way, too. More than anything, management will depend entirely on your pet’s specific triggers and lifestyle, Malawey explains.\nOf course,positive reinforcement trainingis always a plus for any behavioral issues or concerns. Malawey especially recommends recall training with treats for the best results. “One of my favorite ways to address it is by teaching the dog a strong recall cue, then bringing it into the barking context. One bark, they hear the recall cue, and they come running for a nice food reward. Voila! No more barking,” she says.",

    "title": "Dogs May Wag Their Tails Because Humans Love Rhythm, New Research Says",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/humans-rhythm-tail-wagging-news"
  },
  "page_content": "A dog’s tail can communicate a lot — whether it’s a classically cheerful “welcome home, human” wag or a stiff, tense, “back off” twitch. But while plenty of research has investigated how varied a pup’s tail behavior can be, we still don’t know exactlywhydogs wag them. Their wolf ancestors did not use their tails in such a way, so how did domesticated dogs come to be such tail-ftalkers? A new study sheds some light on this question.\nFirst of all, what does a wagging tail mean?\nA dog’s tail is an important tool used for communicating with humans. “Visual signals are used as communicative cues in both human-dog and dog-dog interactions,” Silvia Leonetti, the first author of the studyWhy do dogs wag their tails?, wrote. “In particular, tail attributes such as carriage (i.e. position) and wagging provide readily observable informational cues, which humans use to infer the inner states of dogs.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThough it’s a common misconception, not all tail wagging is positive. As trainer and behaviorist Karen B. Londonwrote for Kinship, there are many different types of tail wags. Body language, speed, tension, and rotation can all give clues to what that particular wag really means.\n“We think that the carriage and the speed, the [beats per minute], might make the difference between ‘I’m so happy to see you’ versus ‘I’m going to attack you.’ That’s what classical dog behavior books report. But it hasn’t been properly quantified yet,” Andrea Ravignani, another writer on the study, toldScience.\nThis body language is not as simple as you probably think.\nWhat’s certain is that domesticated dogs are more likely to wag their tails than other animals; many other animals use their tails for more utilitarian purposes like balancing or moving, rather than communicating. “One study that looked at more than 40 species over a four-year time span found that the domestic dog was the species that wags its tail most,” Silvia Leonetti toldScience.\nWhy do dogs wag their tails?\nFor their study, Silvia Leonetti and her colleagues set out to determine how domesticated dogs came to rely so heavily on their tails for communication. To get to the bottom of the question, the researchers analyzed over 100 different studies on canine tail behavior.\nThey report that dog domestication began during the Upper Paleolithic period (about 35,000 years ago) and resulted in countless changes including teeth size, reduced aggression, and ear shape. This process also “shaped dogs’ cognition and sociability in both dog–dog and dog–human interactions.”\nHumans selected dogs with the most desirable traits when domesticating them, but it isn’t clear whether tail wagging was an intentional or unintentional result of breeding. One hypothesis, called the “domestication syndrome” hypothesis, is that wagging behavior was a “by-product of selection for another trait, such as tameness or friendliness toward humans.”\nWhen your dog growls, they’re expressing their emotions. A study found that you’ll likely be able to understand what they’re feeling.\nAnother hypothesis, which the researchers call the “domesticated rhythmic wagging hypothesis,” is that humans may have specifically targeted dogs who wagged their tails more — and more rhythmically. Why? Simply because humans love rhythm. “Cognitive neuroscience shows that human brains prefer rhythmic stimuli, which trigger pleasurable responses and engage brain networks that are part of the reward system,” Leonetti wrote.\nOverall, the researchers found that most previous research on tail wagging has focused on measuring “when, for how long or at what rate tail wagging (broadly defined) occurs,” which “make[s] teasing apart different evolutionary hypotheses challenging.”\nIn future studies, the researchers hope to see neuroimaging used to shed more light on tail behavior. “We still don’t know exactly which parts of the dog brain control which features of the tail wagging. Is tail wagging for dogs similar to breathing that we can partly control? Or is it similar to blushing? Do rhythmic areas in dog brains activate? I would also want to see whether abstract thinking areas, communication areas, and so on, activate,” Ravignani tellsScience. “It’s a whole world of possibilities to explore and understand.”",

    "title": "So Apparently, Your Dog Might Be Able to Count",

  },
  "page_content": "My mother has two dogs: a Chihuahua and a Pug. If you thinkyourfamily holidays get loud, imagine adding a pair of yappy pups to the traditional family spat. This past year, during Thanksgiving dinner, I fed them some food under the table in an attempt to win their affections (and some brief silence). I then noticed when I gave the Chihuahua two small pieces of turkey and the Pug one, the Pug hung around and stared at me. She gave me a look that roughly translated toWhat the hell, man?Needless to say, this only made her more disruptive.\nIn the following weeks, I recognized similar behavior in my own — much quieter — pup. In December, she grew increasingly excited with each sunrise. It’s almost as if she was counting the days to Christmas, when she typically gets more presents than any actual children in my life.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nNow, there are a couple of possibilities in play here. Either dogs can perform basic arithmetic or I spoil mine to such a degree on holidays that I’m projecting daily excitement onto her. Thankfully, as I crawl closer toward eccentric-uncle-obsessed-with-his-dog territory, there’s evidence to support both options.\nIt turns out, dogs do understand numbers.\nSpecifically, one2019 studyfound that dogs can naturally count and process numbers like their humans do. To determine the presence of this ability, researchers at Emory University used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan the brains of 11 dogs while flashing fluctuating dot arrays on a screen before them. To ensure that their cognitive responses were linked solely to the number of dots, the team held the total area of the dots constant and only alternated the amount. None of the pups had received any prior training in what the study’s authors refer to as “numerosity” and each was of varying breeds.\nA new study suggests that spending time with your pup isn’t just a way to avoid making plans; it’s great for their health.\nIn eight of the 11 dogs, the researchers clocked increased activity in the parietotemporal cortex part of their brain as the number of dots changed. According to the study, a similar region of the human brain is called the parietal cortex, which is responsible for our capacity to spontaneously process basic numerical quantities. That being said, as someone who cheated his way through algebra and still needs a calculator to tip, I would have also fallen in the three out of 11 group if I had taken this test. But while my mathematical abilities may seem anything but innate, most humans are apparently born with them. And the study’s senior author, Gregory Berns, suggests these findings indicate dogs might be as well.\n“Our work not only shows that dogs use a similar part of their brain to process numbers of objects as humans do — it shows that they don’t need to be trained to do it,” the Emory professor of psychologysaid in a statement.\nOf course, 11 is a fairly small sample size, and three dogs failing to show that they recognize changing numbers is pretty substantial. I mean, 10 out of the 11 offensive starters on the Kansas City Chiefs are not datingTaylor Swift, but that one outlier is massively significant. So I consulted with an expert to find out if my dog can truly count or if that’s just in my wildest dreams.\nResearchers say dogs actually have a pretty good sense of what we’re thinking.\nHow do these findings apply to dogs in the real world?\n“I have, on occasion, seen where dogs seem to select things based on quantity or if they have a choice between fewer treats versus more treats, that they will go towards more treats,” saysDr. Valli Parthasarathy, a veterinary behaviorist and co-founder ofSynergy Veterinary Behavior.\nFrom an evolutionary standpoint, she explains that this is likely due to the benefit of estimating the number of predators nearby or the amount of food dogs could forage in the wild. “For example, it would be beneficial to go someplace where there might be more food or more opportunities for things that you want. And there would also be a benefit in avoiding places where there is more of something that’s dangerous,” Dr. Parthasarathy notes.\nShe adds that this ability is now largely tied to expectation. If a pet regularly receives — and is therefore expecting — multiple treats, they’ll notice when they’re given less. It’s like if you went to see the latest Quentin Tarantino film only to later discover in the theater that it was animated and G-rated. It’s better than nothing but not exactly what you were looking for. Although, beyond a sense of disappointment, this capacity for counting can have drawbacks for our pups.\nResearch finds that your pup can smell when you’ve been doom-scrolling, and they get bummed out.\n“If we have dogs that are particularly sensitive or anxious, then you could potentially have dogs that, when something does not happen the way they expect or the number of times that they expect it to, that could lead to increased anxiety,” Dr. Parthasarathy warns before cautioning that whether this frustration is directly tied to counting remains to be seen. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do our best to avoid inspiring these feelings, however. For this, Dr. Parthasarathy recommends sticking to a stable treat routine to set a pet’s expectations.\nThis might mean dogs are even more like us than we know.\nWhen publishing the study, Berns pointed to the fact that humans and dogs are separated by at least 80 million years of evolution. He suggested that these findings may help connect our collective evolutionary developments.\n“Our results provide some of the strongest evidence yet that numerosity is a shared neural mechanism that goes back at least that far,” he added in the statement. For her part, Dr. Parthasarathy agrees that this study shows there’s much more to our canine companions than we realize. She adds that the cognitive abilities of dogs go beyond basic math; they’re emotionally intelligent — unlike most men I know.\n“While we don’t always want to anthropomorphize what it is that a dog is feeling or what their emotions are, there are a lot of parallels that we can relate to them. There are so many similarities in how they process emotions and the way that people seem to process emotions, as well. I think that just points to how similar we are,” Dr. Parthasarathy explains.\nIn the meantime, I know one very hungry pup who is counting the minutes until I feed her.",

  "page_content": "There is a book calledWalter the Farting Dogthat is about as close to being non-fiction as a children’s picture book can get. It’s about a dog named Walter who farts so much that his dad wants to rehome him. (Actually, what? That plot issuperproblematic; forget about that book, andneverrehome a dog for farting.) But the part about dog flatulence is still 100 percent relatable.\nAs much as we might hate to admit it (and smell it), farts are a normal biological function in dogs — and humans, let’s be honest. Farts are the natural result of the surprising amount of air that is swallowed just with the simple act of eating. Here, we explore why dogs fart so much and whether there’s anything you can do to reduce the stink.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhy does my dog fart so much?\nUnfortunately for most pet parents, dog farts are rarely as adorable as the pups they come out of. But, contrary to popular belief, more than 99 percent of the gases that pass from the intestinal tract are odorless (whew!). When they do happen, dog farts are caused by an excess of gases in a dog’s intestinal tract. The gas might be produced in the biochemical process of digestion, gas diffusion from the bloodstream, gases produced by the bacteria that populate the intestinal tract, or air that has been swallowed.\nThe mind-gut connection isn’t just for people. Your dog or cat’s gut microbiome plays a big role in their health and well-being.\nExcess swallowed air is a common cause of dog farts, and several factors can add to an increase in air intake. When dogs eat quickly, the amount of air swallowed tends to increase.\nWhat causes gas in dogs?\nWhen determining why your dog is farting all the time, your vet will address your dog’s diet and rule out intestinal disease. Farting can be a symptom of other health issues, including infections, parasites, colitis, and pancreatitis. Here are a few other medical issues that could cause an increase in farts:\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD)\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD)\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\nAntibiotic-responsive intestinal disorders\nAntibiotic-responsive intestinal disorders\nCancer\nCancer\nIntestinal parasites\nIntestinal parasites\nViral or bacterial inflammation of the intestines\nViral or bacterial inflammation of the intestines\nFood allergy or food intolerance\nFood allergy or food intolerance\nInadequate production of digestive enzymes by thepancreas\nInadequate production of digestive enzymes by thepancreas\nIf your dog suffers from mealtime boredom, spice up their food bowl with one of these tasty toppers.\nAnother frequent source of dog farts isdietary fiber. Dietary fiber in pet food can cause a dog to fart as it is not easily digested by its own enzyme systems. Fiber is easily digested by the gas-producing bacteria that live in the colon. As fiber is broken down here, hydrogen sulfide is produced, which is the cause of the really stinky gases. Therefore, a diet that is heavy in fiber further promotes a “happy environment” as well as “food” for the bacteria, ultimately producing more gas and more farts.\nSome “people foods” may cause dogs to fart more, including legumes (like soybeans, peas, and beans), dairy products (like milk and cheese), sweets (like fruits and cookies), high-fat foods, and spicy foods.\nYes, some dog breeds are more prone to farting.Brachycephalic breeds(dogs with a compressed upper jaw and a short muzzle) like Boston Terriers, French Bulldogs, Pugs, and Boxers fart more than other dog breeds because they breathe more by mouth than by nose. Breathing through their mouth causes them to swallow excess air, leading to more flatulence.\nIs there a way to stop dog farts? Here are some remedies for gassy dogs.\nIf there isn’t a severe medical issue causing your dog’s gas, your veterinarian might determine that your dog’s diet is the problem. When altering your dog’s diet, make changes to their food slowly. Some easy home remedies for gassy dogs to help reduce excessive dog farting include:\nFeeding a mixture of dry and canned foods\nFeeding a mixture of dry and canned foods\nDiscouraging rapid eatingby placing an overturned small bowl inside the dog’s regular food bowl, preventing them from taking large mouthfuls orfeeding them with a slow bowl\nDiscouraging rapid eatingby placing an overturned small bowl inside the dog’s regular food bowl, preventing them from taking large mouthfuls orfeeding them with a slow bowl\nAvoiding soy, soybeans, beans, and peas in the diet\nAvoiding soy, soybeans, beans, and peas in the diet\nAvoiding any treats containing milk, cheese, or other dairy products with lactose\nAvoiding any treats containing milk, cheese, or other dairy products with lactose\nAvoiding fresh or dried-fruit treats\nAvoiding fresh or dried-fruit treats\nAvoiding canned foods containing the texturing ingredient carrageenan\nAvoiding canned foods containing the texturing ingredient carrageenan\nIncreasing activity: Asedentary lifestylecan increase the amount of gases produced as well as how long they “hang out” in the digestive tract. Activity increases gastrointestinal motility, which in turn expels gas and increases regularity of bowel movements.\nIncreasing activity: Asedentary lifestylecan increase the amount of gases produced as well as how long they “hang out” in the digestive tract. Activity increases gastrointestinal motility, which in turn expels gas and increases regularity of bowel movements.\nFrom bloody poop to diarrhea—all your dog’s poop problems explained.\nIf simple remedies don’t ease your dog’s digestion issue, you might need to change theirdog foodaltogether. The best dog food for reducing dog farts is a low-residue diet. A low-residue diet is designed to reduce the frequency and volume of stools, while prolonging transit time through the intestine. It’s similar to a low-fiber diet but includes restrictions on foods that increase bowel activity.\nChanging to a low-residue diet means that most of the nutrients of the food are digested and absorbed by your dog before they reach the colon, where the gas-forming bacteria live. Less food for the bacteria equals less bacteria, which equals less gas formed and less dog farts. Offering your dog a highly digestible diet is one of the major ways to combat flatulence.\nSometimes, just going through a case and/or bag of such a low-residue diet solves the problem and your dog can return to regular food afterwards. If necessary, the therapeutic diet can become your dog’s regular food. Low-residue diets are available through your veterinarian, pet supply stores or can becooked at home(boiled white rice, skinned chicken, cottage cheese and balanced with vitamins and minerals constitute low-residue ingredients).\nFor excessive dog farts, sometimes medication can help. Although there are many products available, most are unfortunately not as helpful as they are touted to be, or not labeled for animal use. There are more than 30 herbal and botanical preparations available to reduce gas in the stomach and intestines; however, the dosage, safety, and efficacy are unknown.\nA new report finds that one in three dogs and one in seven cats have unhealthy levels ofE. colipresent in their gut microbiome.\nIf further relief is needed, your vet may recommend that you give your dog the below for gas.\nYucca schidigera supplementation: Currently, this extract is labeled as a flavoring agent for pet food, but it is also available as an oral supplement. Several studies have shown that it helps decrease the odor of farts.\nZinc acetate supplementation:Zinc binds to sulfhydryl compounds in flatulence, ultimately serving to deodorize the gas.\nNon-absorbable antibiotics: Such antibiotics kill the gas-forming bacteria of the colon and may be helpful as long as their use is not ongoing.\nWhat can I give my dog for gas?\nIf you’re looking for a quick fix for your dog’s foul-smelling gas, you might be inclined to tryanythingto get some relief. While these four commonly touted gas relief products are unlikely to be harmful, they won’t help much either. It’s better to find the source of your dog’s discomfort than to try to cover up the stench.\nSpot lumps, limps, and lethargy early on.\nThere are many ineffectiveprobioticsbeing marketed for gas relief, so it’s important to use one that has been shown to contain live cultures that withstand stomach digestion. It’s unknown if this type of product will really help in reducing dog flatulence; it’s unlikely that these bacteria can survive the acid environment of the stomach, travel through the many feet of small intestines, and finally reach the colon in the attempt to displace the gas-forming resident bacteria. Still, these are unlikely to be harmful and can be beneficial in other ways outside of the realm of dog farts, such as helping to stabilize the intestinal microenvironment.\nThese tablets are not likely to be effective because the charcoal-binding sites are filled on the journey from mouth to colon, so by the time the tablet gets to the gas-forming large bowel bacteria, it has essentially already been used up.\nThis product may control the volume of gas produced, but not the odor. It’s an anti-foaming agent that reduces gas bubbles. This may be helpful at reducing our dog’s gas discomfort, but not the stench or whatever is causing it.\nThe top five reasons dogs bark—and how to get them to relax a bit.\nIt is unlikely that these extra digestive enzymes would help a dog in the absence of actual exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Furthermore, this treatment is relatively expensive for something that may only be slightly helpful.\nSimethicone, the drug found in OTC meds like Gas-X, is safe for dogs. But you should never use it without consulting your veterinarian first. The best thing to do is change your dog's diet since anti-gas medications will only address the symptoms, not the root cause, of your dog's gas.\nWhen should you take a dog to the vet for gas?\nDog farts are a normal part of everyday life, but chronic flatulence and a house filled with stink aren’t. If you notice a sudden increase in dog farts, if your dog seems in pain, or they exhibit other symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, bloating, or weight loss, make an appointment with your vet.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nYes, dog farts are a normal biological function for dogs (and humans!).\nThere’s no research showing that dogs fart more during pregnancy. But anecdotally, many pup parents report that their dogs are gassier when pregnant.\nYes, some dogs may become gassier as they age because their digestive systems slow down and become more sensitive.\nReferences:\nFlatulence in Pet Dogs\nFlatulence in Pet Dogs\nDiet and Dog Farts\nDiet and Dog Farts\nAdministration of Charcoal, Yucca Schidigera, and Zinc Acetate to Reduce Malodorous Flatulence in Dogs\nAdministration of Charcoal, Yucca Schidigera, and Zinc Acetate to Reduce Malodorous Flatulence in Dogs",

  "page_content": "If you’ve spent time hanging out with dogs — or scrolling through your dog-crammed TikTok feed — you’ve probably already figured out that some pups are a little more clever than others. All dogs are perfect (that’s a given), but they’re not exactly equally sharp. If you have a pup with some mega-impressive brainpower, science is now backing up your claim that they might (emphasis onmight) be a legit, Matt-Damon-in-Goodwill-Hunting-level genius.\nHow researchers tested genius dogs\nThe study, published Thursday inScientific Reports, observed 41 dogs who have “a vocabulary of object labels,” also known as “Gifted Word Learner” (GWL) dogs, and quite possibly geniuses. These A students were recruited for the “Genius Dog Challenge” throughan online applicationthat asked dog parents to submit a video of their pups retrieving specific toys based on the name of the toys; the human had to stand outside of the room and ask their dog to retrieve one toy at a time out of a selection of at least three toys.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nAfter the online application, some pups were selected for an online Vocabulary Assessment Test (VAT), which repeated the original task with the presence of researchers, plus collected answers to informal, semi-structured interview questions. They eventually found 41 dogs who knew the names of at least five toys.\nYour dog might not know your name. Don’t take offense; just play this game.\nThe last step of the study was a questionnaire given to pet parents, which covered three topics with more depth: the dogs’ life history, their own experience in raising dogs, and how their dog learned the names of these toys.\nIn the end, they found that 56 percent of the dogs in the Genius Dog Challenge knew the names of at least 20 or more toys, 14 percent knew the names of 15 to 19 toys, 12 percent knew 14 to 10 toys, and 17 percent knew five to nine toys. The maximum number of toy names known by a dog was a whopping 86. Because researchers knew the dogs learned the names of toys very quickly, they later inquired, via questionnaire, whether the dogs had learned more toy names in the months following the VAT. In that questionnaire, 16 pet parents reported that their little Einsteins had learned the names of over 100 toys.\nWhat did the genius dogs have in common?\nResearchers were looking for a common thread between all these clever dogs but couldn’t quite find it. The dogs came from all walks of life, though almost all were from working breeds. Border Collies did make up 52 percent of them, but the rest were a more evenly spread mix of different breeds, including Labradors, Pomeranians, Corgis, and Australian Shepherds. The majority of the pups lived in homes with two caretakers, and 57 percent of the dogs participated in extracurricular training activities, such as obedience training, herding, and dog shows.\nCognitive Science professor Dr. Federico Rossano on how Bunny, TikTok’s “talking” dog, is sparking change in how we communicate with our pets.\nWhen it comes to the backgrounds of the pet parents, their experience varied, too. Twenty-six percent of them were first-time pet parents, 31 percent had had only one dog previously, and 34 percent had raised four or more dogs. Only three pet parents reported that a previous pet had known the names of more than three toys, and only three had a professional background in dog training.\nSo…how can you raise a genius dog?\nHere’s the twist: According to researchers, it seems like you kinda…can’t. Or rather, you can’tintentionallyraise a dog to be a genius. Three-quarters of the pet parents in the study said they initially didnottrain their dogs to learn the names of their toys; the pups started getting them on their own. Each of the pet parents said the dogs learned the names through play interactions, and 80 percent of them reported playing with their dog daily. The majority of the pet parents reported that “spontaneous learning seemed to be effortless.”\nResearchers concluded that “the owners’ training skills are likely not the primary driver behind these dogs’ skill” — if that were the case, they would find multiple GWL dogs living together. In fact, three of the pet parents adopted a puppy during the course of the study, and those dogs did not learn the names of their toys, despite them using the same play and training methods.\nSay What? A look at the types of words that dogs understand.\nSo, basically, if your pup is a genius, you should feel plenty proud, but you can't really take the credit. According to the research, their smarts seem to come pretty naturally — and randomly. That means you probably can’t teach a non-genius pup to become a genius. Though, of course, providing your pup withtons of playtime— andlots and lots of toysto learn the names of — is a good start.",

  "page_content": "Who doesn’t love a good nap? Whether a lazy Sunday afternoon snooze or a quick weekday power nap, a little sleep can be rejuvenating. Dog and cat parents can definitely attest to the joy of a nap. When that little ball of fluff finally stops running around and trying to get intoeverythingand justcurls up to sleep, you can relax for a bit.\nOur favorite domestic animals are often the kings and queens of sleep (they’re called “cat naps” for a reason). If you just got a new pet and you notice they’re constantly heading off to Snoozetown during the time you’d like to be hanging out with them, guess what? You can just napwiththem. Turns out, it’s actually good for you to sneak in a little power nap — why not do it with a snuggly pet by your side?\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nFour signs your puppy is ready for a nap.\nA little snooze can boost your brain.\nSometimes, your mind just needs a little reset, and a short nap can often provide the reboot your brain requires.A 2022 studyfound that naps can help enhance cognitive performance in humans, particularly memory. Napping can also improve vigilance and your ability to process information quickly. The results were consistent across age groups and regardless of when during the day the subject napped.\nShorter naps, however, do have an advantage over longer ones. According to experts, the best nap length isaround 20 to 30 minutes. This shorter nap will keep you in a lighter phase of sleep, making it easier to wake up, whereas a longer nap can leave you with that groggy,What year is it?feeling.\nNapping with a pet is even better.\nSo, we know napping can improve your mental acuity in a number of ways, not to mention your mood, but should you share a nap with your pet?\nSleeping with your pet, even for just a short time, can help your dog or cat trust you and lead to a closer bond over your pet’s lifetime. Plus, snuggling up to your pet leads to an increase in the release of neurotransmitters likedopamine and oxytocin, often referred to as “feel-good hormones.” For those who suffer from anxiety or depression, that happy hormone boost can be a definite plus.\n“Some pets enjoy napping with their people, while others prefer their own space,” Dr. Valli says. “Pets that show any reactive or aggressive behavior when they are touched, jostled, or moved while resting should not nap with their people for safety reasons.”\nDogs need more sleep than humans. Here’s how much is healthy.\nWhether you choose to snooze with your pet or not is, of course, entirely up to you. Some people are restless or light sleepers and can easily be disturbed by the presence of an animal in the bed, even for a nap. And if you have anypet allergies, allowing your dog or cat in the bed is probably not the best idea. But if you and your pet don’t mind, taking a nap with your dog canboost your immunity to bacteria, as well as your mental and emotional well-being.\n“Co-sleeping with pets can have practical benefits, such as increased heat and, when desired, increased security,” Dr. Valli says. “However, research on human-pet co-sleeping is sparse. Co-sleeping may increase attachment of dogs and people toward each other. Petting animals has been shown to have numerous benefits, including decreased blood pressure, heart rate, and depression. It is possible that co-sleeping may help as well.”\nDogs and cats — especially puppies and kittens — actually need naps.\nIf your pet happens to be growing still, they’re definitely be good nap buddies. Both dogs and cats require more sleep than humans, especially when they’re young. The average dog spends as much ashalf the day (12 to 14 hours) snoozing, while cats may nap for as much as 18 to 20 hours. Younger animals sleep even longer, so don’t be surprised if your puppy is asleep for 18 to 20 hours and your kitten passes the 20-hour mark.\n“Sleep is very important for neuronal development and information processing,” Dr. Valli says. “Puppies’ and kittens’ brains are still developing until over a year of age, and when young they are learning extensively. Therefore, nap times are very helpful for facilitating that development. They are also going through very rapid physical growth during the first several months of life, which also takes a lot of energy and promotes napping.”\nIt’s a personal preference, but here are the pros and cons.\nYour pet may also take smaller naps throughout the day to pass the time when you’re away from home or just because they feel comfortable and at ease. (We’ve all seen how much cats love a good sunbeam nap.) If you’re worried that your pet is sleeping too much, talk to your veterinarian, but in most cases, dogs and cats just enjoy a good snooze. And who can blame them?\nA pup snuggle sesh will do you good.\nNot every pet parent is up for anight full of snuggles, especially ifyour cat wants to sleep on top of you. But a little nap time with your pet can be a great way to bond with them, improve your mood, and help you feel a little mentally sharper as you go through the rest of your day. Plus, how can you resist some sleepy cuddles?\nReferences:\nSystematic Review and Meta-Analyses on the Effects of Afternoon Napping on Cognition\nSystematic Review and Meta-Analyses on the Effects of Afternoon Napping on Cognition\nQuick Naps Are Good For Your Brain\nQuick Naps Are Good For Your Brain\nSleep With Your Pet?

  },
  "page_content": "If you have a dog — or if you spend hours scrolling through puppy videos — you probably already know that some pups have a knack for comedy. When you meet an extra-silly dog who seems to live for the applause, you might wonder if they’re trying to make us laugh on purpose — or if they just can’t help but be adorable. It turns out, science has an answer. This week,a TikTok is going viralfor sharing research that shows dogs do, in fact, try to make humans laugh.\nThe research: Dogs understand human emotions.\nThe TikTok is based on a paper called “Emotional communication between dogs and humans,” which was published by Veronika Konok at the Eötvös Loránd University Faculty of Science in Budapest, Hungary in 2014. In it, Konok details many different studies that have shown that dogs understand human emotions and react accordingly (“Duh,” said every dog parent ever).\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nFor example, dogs can distinguish between tones of voice. In one study, “they were slower to take a piece of food when commanded to leave it with an ‘angry voice,’ compared to a ‘happy voice.’” They are also more likely to choose food or retrieve objects that humans have shown positive emotional expressions toward, as opposed to things humans have shown negative emotional expressions toward. Konok concludes that dogs are very perceptive of human emotional states — a fact that’s pretty obvious to any dog parent whose pup snuggles closer to them during tear-y movie nights.\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nAnother study, “Voice-Sensitive Regions in the Dog and Human Brain Are Revealed by Comparative fMRI” by Attila Andics, used an fMRI scanner to show how dogs’ brains respond to human noises. The study found that one area of the dogs’ brains showed more activity when hearing a positive human sound (such as laughter) than a negative human sound (such as crying).\nYour dog is responding to your positivity.\nThe research doesn’t actually prove that dogsintentionallytry to make humans laugh (that’s hard to prove without asking them!), but it shows that dogs show a stronger emotional response to positive human sounds than negative human sounds. So, for example, when you’re laughing at something they’re doing, they might react and make you laugh even harder.\nAnd whether they’re doing it on purpose or not, it’s a fact that our pups are making us laugh all day, every day. Dog parents on TikTok are backing the findings up with some seriously adorable anecdotes. “My dogsuffocatesme with kisses, and then tried even harder when I start laughing. It makes so much sense now,” one user commented. Another commenter joked, “I’m raising a bunch of very expensive comedians.”\nIt’s a nice thought.\nThis trait actually makes dogs really good service animals.\nKonok writes that research on dogs recognizing human emotions explains whythey make exceptionaltherapy and service animals: “Dogs’ ability to develop a complex communication system with humans makes these animals particularly suitable to facilitate social interactions and communication in humans (Cirulli et al., 2011).”\nShe also notes that “emotions enhance memory. There is considerable evidence that events which induce positive or negative emotions are more easily remembered than those which are emotionally neutral” — which means that your pup’s strongest memories of you might be the ones when you’re laughing. Well, that pure fact just makes us want to...cry, actually. Yep, we’re crying.",

  },
  "page_content": "Dogs do many adorable things — butt scooting is not one of them. However, as off-putting as it might be, dogs are usually just carrying out very instinctive animal behaviors. Dogs are dogs at the end of the day. Understanding why dogs do particular behaviors, like butt scooting, will make it easier to know what weird behavior is actually pretty normal and what is not.\nSo, why do dogs scoot their butts on the floor?\nCommonly known asbutt scooting, seeing a dog drag their bum across the ground can be kind of a comical sight…when outside. But on thecarpet, it is a different matter. And what if that carpet is at your in-law’s house? Well, that’s not so funny.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nDogs scoot in almost all cases because something is irritating their anus. The causes range from something as simple as an itch to more serious issues such as worms, wounds, or tumors. It is important to take your dog to the vet to rule out any medical causes and to treat any underlying conditions. There are also a few things you can do at home to help prevent your dog from scooting, such as keeping their anal area clean and free of debris.\nHere are the types of worms your pup could get, how you know they have them in the first place, and how to get rid of them for good.\nCommon causes of butt scooting:\nIrritated butt\nIrritated butt\nDirt or debris\nDirt or debris\nInfected anal sacs\nInfected anal sacs\nAnal gland rupture\nAnal gland rupture\nAnal gland tumors\nAnal gland tumors\nWorms or parasites\nWorms or parasites\nSkin allergies\nSkin allergies\nIf my dog is scooting does it mean there is a medical problem?\nIt could be an issue with your dog’s anal glands: You might not know that your dog has them just inside the rectum. These glands secrete a liquid with unique scent characters that identify one dog from another and provide other information. Whendogs greet each other, they are sniffing these glands. Unfortunately, it’s these glands that can often cause a problem.\nCan you cure dog scooting?\nTreatment for dog scooting really depends on what’s causing your beloved dog to drag their butt. Here are some of the most common causes:\nIf your dog regularly collects small amounts of poop on their butt (yep, we’re talking dingleberries), you should clean the area when returning from walks. It is important to keep their butts clean, as it prevents bacteria from going back into the anal passage and infections from occurring, and it can also cause itchiness. Dogs that have been recently groomed can also feel discomfort or itchiness.\nSometimes dogs will scoot their butt to remove dirt or debris that has collected there on a walk or hike. If they only scoot a few times and it doesn’t continue, it shouldn’t be an ongoing problem.\nOne common cause of continuous scooting is a problem with your dog’s anal sacs. If you can smell a foul odor coming from this region or see bleeding, this generally indicates that theanal glands are impactedor infected, and you should visit your vet. Some dogs need to have their anal sacs drained regularly. If these glands get blocked, the secretion is unable to be expressed.Once squeezed, the impact on your dog’s scooting is immediate.\nYeah, it’s super gross — but your pup will thank you.\nUnfortunately, anal glands can become infected if the fluid doesn’t empty normally. When this happens the fluid can become bloody and may fill with pus and become an abscess. It will look red and swollen around your dog’s anus — if it bursts (or ruptures) and goes untreated, it can cause damage to your dog’s anus and rectum. Take your dog to the vet immediately if you suspect this is the case.\nAnal sac tumors are relatively uncommon in dogs, though they do occur more in Spaniel breeds. The tumor is made up of cells from the glands of the anal sac, and is usually discovered during an annual vet examination. They can metastasize — or spread elsewhere in the body — so it’s important to detect them early. Symptoms may include blood in the stool, swelling in the area and — you guessed it — butt scooting.\nWhen inspecting at home, if you see tiny white specs that resemble grains of rice, it is likely your dog has tapeworms. Tapeworms cause a lot of irritation and discomfort for your dog. Unlike worms, you might not be able to see other parasites. If your dog is dragging their bum along the ground more than once or twice a week, accompanied by licking, biting, and generally seeming agitated, you should visit the vet.\nAllergies might be another source of butt scooting if your dog seemsexcessively itchyin other areas. Whether they’re food or environmental allergies, they can cause itchiness in the anal area. In this case, scooting is a form of scratching.\nAre there home remedies for dog scooting?\nThere are a few natural remedies that can ease your dog’s discomfort, if you feel comfortable administering them at home: warm compresses applied to the area can alleviate inflammation and soothe your pup’s butt. Ingredients such as colloiIdal oatmeal and aloe vera can also help alleviate itching if that’s the cause of your dog’s butt scooting.\nThankfully, there are treatments. But first, you have to figure out why they have an itch to scratch.\nBe sure to check your pup’s rear.\nIf you suspect that there is something more to your dog’s scooting than an itch or an attempt to clean more thoroughly after a bout of diarrhea, you can check your dog’s bum before going to the veterinary clinic. Make sure that you use gloves and lift your dog’s tail. The anus should be clean and free from any smells.\nFAQ (People also ask):\nSome dogs will still scoot for a few days after their glands are expressed because the area is still irritated. But if it persists after three days, there may be another cause to address.\nYour dog may be trying to literally wipe their own butt by scooting — to remove any poop remnants, as well as any dirt or debris that’s accumulated in that area.\nYou want to make pooping as easy as possible, and reduce your dog’s overall movement—so feeding high-quality food and keeping them entertained with stationary toys can help.\nDisease conditions of canine anal sacs\nDisease conditions of canine anal sacs\nAnal Sac Tumors\nAnal Sac Tumors\nAnal Sac Disease in Dogs\nAnal Sac Disease in Dogs\nAnal Sac Tumors in Dogs\nAnal Sac Tumors in Dogs\nNo More Scooting! 5 Home Remedies for Your Dog's Itchy Bum\nNo More Scooting! 5 Home Remedies for Your Dog's Itchy Bum\nThe Top 4 Causes Of Scooting In Dogs\nThe Top 4 Causes Of Scooting In Dogs\nHow to Keep Dog from Scooting after Surgery?\nHow to Keep Dog from Scooting after Surgery?\nWhy Is My Dog Dragging Its Bottom?\nWhy Is My Dog Dragging Its Bottom?",

But have you ever listened to your dog — like, really listened to them when they grumble or growl? Did you swear you could understand their deepest emotions and desires? It turns out, when your dog is growling, theyareexpressing their emotions — and most likely, you’ll be able to understand what they’re feeling.\nWhy do dogs growl?\nDogs growl in different contexts—when guarding something of value, when threatened by a stranger, and during play. These growls can sound remarkably similar to the novice human ear, but astudy in the journal Animal Behavioursuggests that the meanings of these growls are very different to dogs.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents.

The growls recorded during play were very different than the other types of growls — they were shorter and higher in pitch.After discovering the variance in sound, they tested the theory. They gave dogs the opportunity to approach a high-quality food item (a cooked meaty bone) when alone in a room. Then, they piped in the recorded sound of either a growl made when a dog was threatened by a stranger or a growl made by a dog guarding a bone. They tested 41 dogs in this way and found that dogs were significantly more likely to back away from the bone when they heard the bone-guarding growl than when they heard the threatened-by-a-stranger growl.\nIdentifying dog growls\nA studypublished infound that humans were able to identify dogs’ growls within the context of the setting. When given the options of three social situations (guarding food from another dog, playing tug with a person, and being approached by a stranger), people were able to differentiate what emotion the growling dog was experiencing in that moment. “We found that playful growl bouts are built up from short, quickly repeated growls, while the aggressive ones were more elongated,” explained lead researcher Tamás Faragó. “The food guarding growls differed from the threatening growls in their formant dispersion, a parameter that gives a size impression of the vocalizing individual for the listeners.”\nTwo animal behavior experts agree it’s usuallyplay fighting. Here’s how you can tell.\nPeople were asked to rate each growl on a sliding scale for each of the following emotions: fear, aggression, despair, happiness and playfulness. Overall, people correctly identified the context of 63 percent of the growls, which is significantly better than the 33 percent rate that chance predicts. The play growls were most readily identified, with 81 percent of them being correctly chosen. The food guarding growls were correctly identified 60 percent of the time, compared with 50 percent of the growls directed at strangers. Most of the errors in identifying these two (potentially aggressive) contexts involved confusion between the two of them, rather than with the playful context.\nIt may come as no surprise that dog people were better than non-dog people at correctly identifying a growl's meaning. The study also found that women were better at distinguishing between the growls. “This is a common pattern in emotion recognition studies,” says Tamás. “Probably [some] women are more empathic and sensitive to others’ emotions, and this helps them to better associate the contexts with the emotional content of the growls.”\nThe researchers’ takeaway from the study was that people can distinguish different types of dog growls, including being able to tell apart growls that are both in potentially aggressive contexts. Previous studies have found that people’s ability to understand canine growls is influenced by the time between growls and the duration of the growls — longer gaps between growls is associated with higher aggression scores. Shorter growls are generally perceived as more positive on emotional scales. In growls recorded in the context of a stranger approaching, the higher the pitch of the growl, the higher the fearfulness score.\nYoucanlive in a quiet house again.\nIndividual people varied in their ability to identify the context of the growls, too. Overall, women were better at it then men. Pet parents also outperformed people who do not have dogs. Whether or not a person had ever been bitten by a dog had no effect.\nDogs have a huge range of vocalizations and yet much remains to be learned about the differences in meanings of their vocal communication. These studies are one step towards a fuller understanding of the vocal repertoire of dogs and how we interpret their emotions.",

    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/why-do-dogs-eyes-glow"
  },
  "page_content": "Have you ever looked into a dark room, seen two glowing lights shining back at you and jumped about a foot before you realized it was just your sweet little pup and not a trash-hungry raccoon that had somehow made its way into your home?\nDog eyes glow in the dark because of a specialized structure called the tapetum lucidum. This layer of cells behind the retina reflects incoming light back through the retina, enhancing a dog’s night vision. The reflected light often appears green or yellowish to human observers. Not all dogs display the same level of eye glow, with existing variations among breeds and individuals. While this phenomenon is natural and not harmful, a sudden change in eye appearance should prompt a visit to the veterinarian.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhat causes dog eyes to glow in the dark?\nDog eyes don’t actually “glow” or produce light in the dark — they reflect. Dogs have a special layer in the back of their eyes that acts as a mirror and reflects light back onto the retina, allowing more light to reach the receptors in the eye. To make this process more clear (pun intended), we’ll follow the path of light through a dog’s eye.\nLight enters the eye through thecornea— the clear surface of the eye. Light then travels through thepupil, which is the opening in the middle of the eye. Theiris(the colored portion of the eye) changes size to control the amount of light allowed to pass through the pupil. After passing through the pupil, light hits thelens, a clear disk that can change its shape to focus light onto the retina.\nThose soulful eyes mean everything to you—learn all about them.\nTheretinais the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. Between the retina and the vessels that supply it with blood, there is a special reflect layer called the tapetum lucidum that reflects light back onto the retina, increasing the amount of light received for interpretation. This reflective layer causes dogs eyes to appear to glow in the dark. The information from the cells in the retina travels to the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain.\nWhat is the purpose of this ability?\nDogs are not considered to benocturnalanimals like that raccoon you suspected was in your dark kitchen, but they are sometimes active at night. The ability to see well in low-light conditions, like at dawn or dusk, gives them a competitive advantage when it comes to hunting and avoiding predators.\nPart of the reason a dog’s eye glows in the dark is so they are able to sense motion when there is less light available. This means they can sense moving objects (like prey) better than humans can. So if your dogsuddenly focuseson what appears to be an invisible object at dawn or dusk, they may be looking at something that you can’t see.\nTapetum lucidum in dogs\nThe tapetum lucidum in dogs’ eyes is usually nine to 20 layers thick. It is an organized structure with cells that contain reflective crystals. In dogs, these cells are rich in zinc (a metal) and cysteine (an amino acid) that combine to function as a mirror. When light hits the tapetum lucidum, it is reflected back onto photoreceptor cells of the retina, allowing the light that didn’t reach a receptor the first time a second chance to be absorbed and processed by the brain.\nIsAnimal Planetreally their favorite channel?\nThis adaptation for low-light vision comes with a disadvantage. The reflection of light from the tapetum lucidum will scatter the light in a way that reduces adog’sability to seefine details. This is one of the reasons why dogs have worse visual acuity than humans. Visual acuity is a measurement of how well details of an object are seen at a given distance. When referring to people with 20/20 vision, this means they can see what the average person can see from 20 feet away. Using this standard,dogs are thought to have 20/75 vision, meaning they would need to be 20 feet away from an object to see the same amount of detail that the average person can see from 75 feet.\nMost dogs have a tapetum lucidum, though the appearance can vary in prominence and color. Siberian Huskies and other dogs with white fur and blue eyes are more likely to lack a tapetum lucidum. Toy breed dogs, such as thePomeranian, have smaller tapetum lucidum than larger breed dogs.\nThe color of a dogs’ tapetum lucidum can vary. The amount of zinc cysteine in a dog’s tapetum lucidum can impact how reflective it is and the colors that it reflects. Yellow-green and orange are the most common colors for a dog’s tapetum lucidum. Blue-green, yellow, and green are commonly seen as well. Onestudy documenteda correlation betweencoat colorand tapetum lucidum color in dogs. Dogs with red or brown coats were more likely to have orange-ish tapetums, while dogs with white or gray coats were more likely to have greenish tapetums.\nIt’s not all black and white.\nColor variation can also be affected by age. The tapetum lucidum cannot be seen in the first 35 days of a dog’s life. It gradually shifts in color and prominence duringearly puppyhoodand becomes a stable color around three months of age. In a dog’ssenior years, the tapetum lucidum can appear brighter as a result of retinal thinning or degeneration.\nSome dogs have different-colored reflections in each eye. This is commonly seen with dogs with heterochromia — eyes with different colored irises. The tapetum lucidum in blue-eyed dogs tends to lack pigment, be underdeveloped, or be absent. A dog may have different-colored reflections or have one eye that lacks a reflection. This can be a normal feature if it has been present from puppyhood. If an adult dog has a sudden change in the reflectivity of just one eye, it may indicate an issue and should be checked by a veterinarian.\nIf a dog’s eyes reflect red, they likely lack a tapetum lucidum. The retina is rich with blood vessels. When light is reflected from an eye that lacks a tapetum lucidum (like a human’s), the red color of the retina is reflected back.\nIf it looks like a dog’s eyes are glowing green, you’re likely seeing the reflection from the tapetum lucidum. The spectrum of colors can vary from dog to dog, but a shade of green is commonly seen.\nYour dog sees you as their best friend, so keep those eyes healthy.\nDog vision is adapted to help them see better at night than humans can. The adaptations that help dogs see at night include:\nTapetum lucidum: The specialized layer of cells that reflects additional light onto the light receptors of the retina.\nTapetum lucidum: The specialized layer of cells that reflects additional light onto the light receptors of the retina.\nLarge pupils: Dogs’ large pupils allow more light to reach the retina.\nLarge pupils: Dogs’ large pupils allow more light to reach the retina.\nMore rods than cones: The retina has two types of photoreceptors: rods that detect light and motion and cones that detect color.

If there is a sudden change in your dog’s eye glow, have them seen by a veterinarian.\nReferences:\nDynamics of the Normal Aspect of Tapetum Lucidum at Dogs Regarding Age\nDynamics of the Normal Aspect of Tapetum Lucidum at Dogs Regarding Age\nEye Structure and Function in Dogs\nEye Structure and Function in Dogs\nNormal Color Variations of the Canine Ocular Fundus, a Retrospective Study in Swedish Dogs\nNormal Color Variations of the Canine Ocular Fundus, a Retrospective Study in Swedish Dogs\nVision in Dogs\nVision in Dogs\nWhat Do Dogs (Canis Familiaris) see?

    "title": "9 Reasons Why Dogs Put Their Ears Back",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/ears-held-back"
  },
  "page_content": "If you can wiggle your ears, you have a unique talent that only around ten percent of humans possess. And while most humans can’t literally perk their ears up for anything, dogs can and do move their ears frequently and for many different reasons. Their ears provide complex messaging too. This is because similar positions can have multiple meanings, depending on the context and their other body language.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhy do dogs pull their ears back?\nDid you know that dogs have about three times more muscles in their ears than we do? If you really study your dog’s ears, you’ll notice they are almost constantly moving. Dogs utilize their beefed-up ear muscles for many important roles. Primarily, they use them to improve their hearing by moving their ears in the direction of sounds. They also move their ears to communicate with other dogs.\nDepending on the breed and ear conformation, a dog may be able to make their ears stand straight up on top of their head and/or pull them back to varying degrees. You’ll have to look at all the other signals from your dog to get the best read on what’s going on and to understand why your dog pulls their ears back in different situations.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nWhat your dog’s pinned-back ears could mean\nDifferent emotions and needs may be tied to their ear positions, including:\nFearfulnessis often communicated by ears that are pulled back. This is especially true if combined with other body language such as a hunched body posture, tucked tail, and/or avoiding eye contact. Other signs of fear include physical changes like panting or breathing quickly, dilated pupils, shaking, yawning frequently, and/or vocalizing.\nSadness can also be expressedpartly by ear position. Many pet parents report anecdotally that their dogs experience feelings similar to sadness and/or depression if they lose a companion or even if they are asked to do something they don’t want to do. It may be intertwined with feelings like anxiety or fear and can also result in ears that are pulled close to the head.\nAnxious behaviorsmay include ears that are pulled back along with other signs of stress like panting, looking away, yawning frequently, whining, licking their lips and/or acting restless. Some dogs havespecific anxieties such as storms, fireworks, or trips to the vet, while other dogs may begenerally anxiousand show signs in lots of different situations.\nWhen dogs approach each other or initiate play, they may put their ears back, though in this context they usually just pull their ears backslightly.This is considered an appeasement behavior meant to reassure the other dog that they mean no harm. The rest of their body language should confirm this with signs such as a loose, wiggly body,friendly tail wag, and/orplay bows.\nDogs that feel especially scared, threatened, or aggressive often show very dramatic body language. This can include ears that are pulled very far back so they are nearly flat against the head. Theyoften will be growlingwith very stiff body posture, hard-barking, staring, and/or lunging. This is a clear message to back off and beware.\nA male dog may display a number of behaviors aimed at seeking a female dog’s interest. This can include pulling his ears back as he approaches her. It may overlap with appeasement gestures as another sign that he’s not a threat to the female dog.\nWhen dogs are generally sick or in pain, they may also hold their ears back. This may be due to fear and anxiety related to being in pain and they will likelyshow other signs of pain,too.\nDogs frequently move their ears to maximize hearing. Think of their outer ear as a big funnel which helps to capture and concentrate sounds. By moving their ears in the direction of the sound, they are able to amplify faint sounds that may be far away too.\nFor some dogs, their ears naturally rest in a pulled back position. This can be breed-related or due to certain injuries that cause scarring or deform the natural shape of the ear. For example, aural hematomas can damage the shape of their ears making them look more pulled back or shriveled as well.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nHow else can I understand my dog’s expressions and body language?\nA dog’s whole body is communicating information about their emotional state and a dog’s ear position is just one small part of the whole puzzle.Understanding dog body languageis complex and it can take time to learn all of the subtle cues dogs use to express themselves.\nIn addition to body language, dogs also communicate with scents and vocalizations, so it is important to factor these in as well. When studying your dog’s body language, it may be helpful to break it down into different sections of their body.\nOverall body position: Note your dog’s posture and level of tension in their muscles. Is your dog tense and still? This can be a sign that they are on guard, feeling scared, and/or threatened. A loose, wiggly body is a sign they are comfortable and ready to play. Is their posture hunched, cowering, or upright? Is their hair standing up on end, making them look puffed up and intimidating? These general body positions can be a good indicator of how your pup is feeling.\nEyes: A hard, direct stare is a sign of aggression and may be a warning before a bite occurs.\nWide eyes with the white part of the eye showing, known as a “whale eye,” and large, dilated pupils are both signs of fear and anxiety. Dogs that are avoiding eye contact and/or looking down are also showing signs of fear.\nMouth: A dog with a slightly opened, relaxed mouth is usually at ease. A dog with a tightly closed mouth or a mouth pulled back in a grimace may be feeling afraid. Lip licking and/or yawning canindicate anxiety. A dog who is baring their teeth is warning those around them that they feel threatened and may be ready to bite.\nTail:The tail is well-known as a mood indicator, but humans often get the message wrong. Tail wags can mean different things from friendliness to aggression depending on the subtle changes inhowthey are wagging. A circular wag and loose body is usually a sign of friendliness, while a tail that is waving like a flag with a rigid upright position and just a small wave of the tip often indicates a high level of arousal and/ aggression. A tucked tail is usually associated with fear and/or anxiety.\nBottom line\nDogs communicate tons of information through their body language, including their ear positions.\nDogs communicate tons of information through their body language, including their ear positions.\nHumans often need practice in understanding and interpreting dog body language.\nHumans often need practice in understanding and interpreting dog body language.\nWhen a dog’s ears are pulled back, it can mean many different things.

It is very important to look at the full picture includingallof their body language and the context of the situation.\nFAQs\nUnderstanding your dog’s ear positions helps you to know how your dog is feeling. It can deepen your bond with them and enhance your dog’s ability to communicate with you. It also offers insights into how they might behave if you approach them, and may help you identify when to intervene to avoid dangerous situations.\nEars pulled back can mean so many things, so it is important to look for other clues in their body language and in the situation. Be cautious if you notice other signs that may indicate pain, fear, and/or aggression.\nOne ear up and one ear down is the universal signal of extreme cuteness in dogs, but is not associated with any particular mood or emotion. Often, one ear has stronger cartilage or muscles, which may be more common in puppies than in adult dogs. This asymmetry could also signal an injury to that ear.\nDog ears folded back are just temporarily stuck that way, and there is no emotional message associated with it. A quick shake or a helping hand from their human can revert a folded ear to its normal position.\nReferences\nBoneh-Shitrit, Tali, et al. “Explainable Automated Recognition of Emotional States from Canine Facial Expressions: The Case of Positive Anticipation and Frustration.” Scientific Reports, vol. 12, no. 1, 30 Dec. 2022, p. 22611,www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-27079-w,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-27079-w.\nBoneh-Shitrit, Tali, et al. “Explainable Automated Recognition of Emotional States from Canine Facial Expressions: The Case of Positive Anticipation and Frustration.” Scientific Reports, vol. 12, no. 1, 30 Dec. 2022, p. 22611,www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-27079-w,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-27079-w.\nBremhorst, A., et al. “Evaluating the Accuracy of Facial Expressions as Emotion Indicators across Contexts in Dogs.” Animal Cognition, 2 Aug. 2021,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-021-01532-1.\nBremhorst, A., et al. “Evaluating the Accuracy of Facial Expressions as Emotion Indicators across Contexts in Dogs.” Animal Cognition, 2 Aug. 2021,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-021-01532-1.\n‌Gähwiler, Sarah, et al. “Fear Expressions of Dogs during New Year Fireworks: A Video Analysis.” Scientific Reports, vol. 10, no. 1, 29 Sept. 2020,www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72841-7.pdf,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-72841-7.\n‌Gähwiler, Sarah, et al. “Fear Expressions of Dogs during New Year Fireworks: A Video Analysis.” Scientific Reports, vol. 10, no. 1, 29 Sept. 2020,www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72841-7.pdf,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-72841-7.\nHasegawa, Masashi, et al. “Dogs’ Body Language Relevant to Learning Achievement.” Animals, vol. 4, no. 1, 27 Feb. 2014, pp. 45–58,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani4010045.

    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/kids-approaching-dogs-viral-tweet"
  },
  "page_content": "The internet and trolling. It’s a relationship as symbiotic as organism and parasite. There was a time when this give-and-hot-take dynamic was mildly amusing, albeit still pretty annoying. Somebody would drop in and say something along the lines of, “Jordan could never compete in today’s NBA,” and pointless chaos would ensue. But like the sky in early December, things got dark quickly. Case in point, on the hellscape formally known as Twitter, one woman recently shared an encounter between her dog and a stranger’s child, and the discourse that followed quickly made the post go viral. Now, if you thought the split between Jordan and LeBron fans was hostile, you’ve never seen the battle between pet parents and human parents.\nSaturday night, Lynne Schmidt, under the account @AbortionChat,posted a pictureof her dog, Zoë, to X, along with a short retelling of the incident. “Small child runs up to Zoë. I body block and say, ‘Maybe we don’t run up to dogs we don’t know.’ The parent: She’s three. Me: ‘If she isn’t on voice recall, maybe she should be leashed?” the post read. As of publication, the tweet has gathered over 23 million views and 2,500 replies. Thankfully, they were all very thoughtful, constructive, and respectful (my sarcasm should be screaming through the screen at you right now).\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nTo represent the parent’s perspective, one account eloquently put it, “People >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Animals.” Another added “If she’s a danger to children in public spaces, maybe she needs to be put down?” To which I say, OOF. Worth noting that Schmidt went on to add that her dog is aservice animal.\nNaturally, pet parents were also heated. “‘She's three.’ More of a reason you should be paying attention to your child and making sure they are not running up to dogs they don’t know,” one account replied. Another took the opportunity to not only show support for the animal but reminisce. “Honestly, I think that’s a great suggestion! I was a leashed kid and that’s probably a major reason why I’m still around,” they wrote.\nThey’ll always remember their first childhood pet—this intro is just the beginning.\nOf course, others put their tin foil hats on and claimed the incident never happened at all — an increasingly common online response to anything unsettling that I do not have the patience or energy to dive into here. But what I do have time for are some tips to help human and pet parents in the real world minimize these situations and coexist peacefully on their daily trips to the park.\nAlways ask\nFor starters, parents should not let children approach strange dogs, and even dogs they have met before. “We should never assume a dog is friendly — even a dog we’ve petted or played with before,” explains Ali Smith, a dog trainer and founder ofRebarkable. “Because, like us humans, dogs have bad days or maybe feeling unwell, so always ask.”  She adds that unless they’re familiar with the animal, kids should keep their distance from any dog that is alone, even if they’re behind a fence or gate. This is in the best interest of the child, dog, and each’s parents.\nLorrie Reynolds, a trainer who runsMaximum Fun Dog Sports, adds that many dogs are frightened of children. But that doesn’t exclude pet parents from any responsibility here. “Handlers should instruct a child on how to approach their dogs, if their dogs are open to meeting children,” she says. “Otherwise, they should politely ask them to stop their approach.”\nEvery pup should have basic obedience training, including recall and simple commands like sit, before meeting children, explains Reynolds. The ideal situation is that dogs are socialized with kids when they’re young, but that is understandably not always an option, especially when you adopt.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nSmith confirms that it’s also up to the pet parents to let an approaching child know if their pup is not up for intros. “Dog guardians can intervene and say ‘hello’ and ask the child to wait there for a moment and explain if the child can or cannot pet the dog, and how is best to do so. If you want to say no, then do so,” she explains.\nMinimize risks\nNow, let’s say all parties involved are on the same page and want this meeting to go down. There are several things to keep in mind that will help everything go smoothly and minimize risks. Ivan Petersel, dog trainer founder ofDog Wizardry, warns that children can often be around the same height as dogs, which causes some confusion for the animals. An extension of that concern is the opportunity for extensive eye-to-eye contact, something dogs may view as threatening.\nAdditionally, the way adults approach new pets is usually much different than how youngsters do it. “Kids move differently than adults and are often erratic and unpredictable,” Petersel says. “This can cause the dog to react with fear, aggression, etc.” As a result, pet parents and human parents should be keeping a close eye on the dog’s body language. If they’re jumping or lunging to play with the child, then the interaction should probably be stopped. Petersel adds that pups may not immediately understand a child’s boundaries and can end up hurting kids even when they’re just being playful.\nStep one: Never put your face close to theirs.\nTake it slow\nAfter all these things are considered and an introduction seems reasonable, the most important thing is to take it slow. “Firstly, allow the dog to gently sniff the child if it feels safe and the dog’s body language is relaxed,” Petersel advises. He does not recommend, however, that the kid put their hand out. “The dog can smell your ankles, shirt, etc. No need to stick out your hand. A dog can smell a drop of blood in something that’s the size of an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Their sense of smell is incredibly strong, and there is no reason to create any risk.”\nHe says to wait until the pup is relaxing before having children gently brush their hand against the dog. Hovering above the animal is also a bad idea. Instead, let the dog slowly show them how they feel comfortable being pet and follow that lead. Reynolds adds that children should only pet them on the shoulder or side and never the head, ears, or tail.\nYou may have also noticed that none of these experts recommended the dog or child to aggressively attack one another and their beliefs on the world wide web before meeting. This is, evidently, some guidance a lot of us could all use.",

  },
  "page_content": "Dog whimpering can have a handful of meanings, but it basically chalks up to one purpose: communication. Dogs whimper to communicate with each other and with humans. “A large majority of canine communication is through manipulation of the body,” saysRenee Rhoades, an applied animal behaviorist and founder ofR+Dogs, a virtual canine behavior practice. Sometimesvocalizations, like whimpering, serve as a more direct and urgent way for dogs to convey their needs.\nThe sound of a dog whimpering is both attention-grabbing and heart-wrenching, and that’s exactly the point. In short, researchers found that a whimpering dogsounds as sad as a crying babyto some pup parents, even suggesting that dogs have evolved effective distress signals due to their dependence on humans.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nIf your dog is whimpering for attention, they’re counting on you to hone in on theirbody languageand other cues to figure out why. If you’ve considered all the reasons why your dog is whimpering and are still unsure of the cause, err on the side of caution and take your dog to the vet. They’ll rule out any medical problems.\nTime to whip outThe Notebookfor a little doggie movie night.\nWhy are pet owners affected by a dog’s whimpering?\nHumans and dogs share a similar emotional reaction to high-pitched sounds, and it isn't just a coincidence.Higher-frequency noises in humans and non-human speciesoften indicate danger, so we’ve developed an innate reaction to respond as a protective mechanism.\nWhat’s more is that research has shown that pet parents, in particular, are more attuned to distress sounds from their furry friends. Astudy involving over 500 young adultsfound that dog whines evoke a stronger negative response from pet parents compared to those without pets. We could assume this heightened sensitivity deepens theemotional connection between humans and their pets.\nHowever, Rhoades points out that we can also become conditioned to associate whining or whimpering with negative behaviors. This can lead us to feel annoyed rather than empathetic when a dog whines or whimpers. “Please do not discount your dog's whimpering and whining as negative or ‘bad’ behavior and disregard it or try to punish it,” she counters.\nThat same study involving more than 500 young adults found that cat parents had a less significant response to cat meows than dog parents had to dog whining. Katherine Young, a collaborator on the study, suggests that dogs may have more effective distress signals due to their greater dependence on humans. After all, she considers cats to be semi-domesticated, requiring less general care than dogs.\nWhat Ithinkmy cat is trying to tell me at the crack of dawn. Every. Single. Morning.\n“This difference in animal dependence may explain why dog whines are rated as more negative than cat meows by all adults, including cat owners. Dogs may simply have more effective distress signals than cats,” shetold Neuroscience News.\nWhy Is My Dog Whimpering?\nDogs whimper to get attention, and they’re very good at it. But Rhoades warns that we shouldn’t shrug off our dogs’ whimpering. Instead, she says to practice patience and compassion, giving them the benefit of the doubt. Dogs have important stuff to say.\nOther signs that your dog needs to use the bathroom include pacing and door monitoring. Remember that while every dog's schedule can vary, a good rule of thumb is to let your dog out at least every six hours. Puppies need potty breaks every one to three hours, depending on their age.\nIf your dog is extra vocal, it may be a sign they simply want more of your time. “In situations like this, I run through the list of options somewhat like a baby,” Rhoades says. “I think about what my dog has done during that day and if I have been able to meet all of their needs.”\nIf you’re sticking to a regular feeding schedule—most vets recommend it—you shouldn’t need to feed your dog between meals. On top of the risk of weight gain, rewarding whimpering with food could encourage your pup to do it more often.\nThe most mouth-watering treats for training your pup.\n\"Loud noises, new atmospheres, and car rides are common stressors in dogs,\" says Dr. Tara Hansen, DVM, a veterinarian atChewy. Some dogs may hide, pant, or refuse food when stressed, anxious, or scared. Others become more vocal, such as whimpering orbarking, restless, or agitated.\nDogs often whine when they are frustrated or confused. This can happen when they’re restrained, such as by a leash or fence, or when they are unsure about a situation or the intentions of another animal or person.\nDogs whine when they are happy or excited, and you can usually tell by context and their body language. For instance, if your dog runs to you, is willing to put on their harness, and then runs to the door whining, they’re excited, Rhoades says.\nIf you notice your dog whining, especially if there are other changes in behaviors such as restlessness, pacing, orlicking a particular area, take them to the vet to rule out any medical problems.\nUnfortunately, your dog may be whimpering due to a health problem. If your dog is whining excessively, it’s important to rule out any medical problems with your veterinarian. Once you have done this, you can seek professional help from a trainer to address any behavioral issues that may be contributing to the whining.\n“Any qualified ethical dog professional will encourage you to have your dog physically examined before doing any behavior work, as this is the golden standard,” Rhoades says.\nThe key to curbing mindless snacking — this is for your dog.\nIs it common for dogs to whimper?\nIt’s common for dogs to whimper when they are excited, hungry, frightened, confused, in pain, or uncomfortable. It’s important to never ignore your dog's whimpering, as it may be a sign of a problem or an unfulfilled need.\nHow do you calm a whimpering dog?\nAccording to Rhoades, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to calming a whimpering dog. The best way to reduce whining is to ensure that you are meeting your dog's needs, providing a routine, and usingpositive reinforcement training. Hansen offers the following solutions for specific situations:\nAttention-seeking whining: Wait until your dog is calm before engaging with them, responding to attention-seeking whimpers only reinforces the behavior. If all other needs seem to be met, try to find an enrichment activity to keep your dog occupied, such as puzzles, interactive games, exercise, or sniff walks.\nAttention-seeking whining: Wait until your dog is calm before engaging with them, responding to attention-seeking whimpers only reinforces the behavior. If all other needs seem to be met, try to find an enrichment activity to keep your dog occupied, such as puzzles, interactive games, exercise, or sniff walks.\nStress-related whining: Try to identify and modify or remove the stressor while comforting your dog. For example, if your dog whines when you leave for work in the morning, try leaving them with a Kong filled with peanut butter or other treats to keep them occupied. If your dog has persistent stress or anxious behaviors, especially if they seem generalized, they may need to be addressed by a veterinarian or behaviorist. The same is true for pups who repeatedly whine, cry, or show other signs of distress when kenneled.\nStress-related whining: Try to identify and modify or remove the stressor while comforting your dog.

Dogs tend to be stoic and quiet when they are uncomfortable, so vocalization due to pain is a sign that veterinary attention is needed promptly,” Hansen says.\nIf your dog keeps whimpering for no reason (Rhoades and Hansen say there is always a reason!), first, see your veterinarian, then consider working with a certified dog trainer.\nTime to whip outThe Notebookfor a little doggie movie night.\nFAQs (People also asked):\nWhimpering is a natural form of canine communication, so it’s not inherently bad. “Do not discount your dog's whimpering and whining as negative or “bad” behavior and disregard it or try to punish it,” Rhoades says. However, if your dog is whimpering excessively, it is important to assess the situation and determine whether the behavior is normal or requires professional intervention.\nIf you can’t figure out why your dog is whimpering, take them to the vet. In fact, Rhoades says, behaviorists will typically recommend a veterinary checkup before working with a dog that is whimpering excessively. “If you see signs of illness like lack of appetite, lethargy, limping, or intense licking at an area, discomfort might be a logical explanation,” Hansen says, and your dog should see their vet.\nReferences:\nPolyphony of Domestic Dog Whines and Vocal Cues to Body Size\nPolyphony of Domestic Dog Whines and Vocal Cues to Body Size\nOccurrences of Non-Linear Phenomena and Vocal Harshness in Dog Whines as Indicators of Stress and Ageing\nOccurrences of Non-Linear Phenomena and Vocal Harshness in Dog Whines as Indicators of Stress and Ageing\nShould I Whine or Should I Bark?

  },
  "page_content": "Is there really a difference between male and female dogs? “If you want a good dog, get a male. If you want a great dog, get a female — and cross your fingers.” That old saying has been passed down through generations in a variety of fields from Retriever training to Sheepdog handling. But is it true? Are there significant sex-related differences in the training and performance of dogs?\nMale vs. female dogs: Are there any real differences?\nThe most important factor is the individual dog’s personality. It’s true that male dogs are typically larger and have larger heads and necks than female dogs — statistically, they are taller and weigh more.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nSome studies have shown that male dogs are more aggressive than female dogs, while other studies have found no significant differences. Spaying and neutering can serve to reduce some of the behavioral differences between male and female dogs. It’s important to socialize and train all dogs, regardless of their sex.\nThe research on male vs. female dogs\nThe first obvious source for an answer is the annals of research. The problem is, it’s only recently that dogs have migrated from persona-non-grata status in science to an animal of interest. Research on domestic dog behavior is blossoming, but most of it is about cognition and problem solving. That’s great stuff, but it won’t necessarily answer our question.\nThe classicGenetics and the Social Behavior of the Dogby Scott and Fuller, first published in 1965 asks: “Are male dogs bigger than females?” They found sex differences in weight gain (male dogs, not surprisingly, grow larger in early adolescence), but concentrated primarily on breed differences, rarely looking at sex as a factor in any of their experiments. They did ask if sex had an influence on what they called “emotional reactivity.” Based on their scoring system, female dogs averaged 5.0 and male dogs 4.9 — in other words, no difference at all.\nAre there behavioral differences between male and female dogs?\nAggressiveness and boldness, described as a behavioral syndrome, were reported as being higher in males than females. Females also seemed more inclined to interspecific social interactions with humans in tasks that require cooperative skills, but males appeared more inclined to social play, thus implying different levels of social engagement between the sexes, depending on the context.\nStudies on cognitive processes underlined a greater flexibility in resorting to a particular navigation strategy in males. Both male and female dogs have the ability to show aggression, but the statistics show that “entire” (not neutered) male dogs are more likely to show aggression than female dogs or neutered males. Unfortunately this isn’t the easy answer it might appear to be.Male dogs are likely to be more competitive over things they value than are either females or neutered males. They may be more confident in their ability to control things they think are important and that may lead them into conflict in situations in which their owners expect them to defer, or do as they are told.\nA University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicinestudyrevealed that hormone levels of oxytocin (the “cuddle” hormone) and vasopressin (an antidiuretic hormone linked to heightened aggression in humans) influence canine social behavior and aggression, too. Interestingly, service dogs, which are bred for their easy-going temperament had higher levels of oxytocin in their blood compared to average dogs.\nIn contrast, dogs who were more aggressive toward other dogs had more vasopressin. What isn’t known is if vasopressin levels cause aggression or are the result of aggression, but at least there is an underlying base for the behavior for more research to be done. So maybe some behavior traits aren’t a matter of gender but of other factors like hormones and as canine behavior experts say, individual temperament, genetics, breeding, socialization, environment, and leadership of pet parents.\nAre there learning differences between male and female dogs?\nHere are some answers from fellow trainers:\n“Male dogs are softer.”\n“Male dogs are softer.”\n“Female dogs are softer.”\n“Female dogs are softer.”\n“Male dogs are more independent.”\n“Male dogs are more independent.”\n“Female dogs are more independent.”\n“Female dogs are more independent.”\n“Male dogs are easier to train than female dogs.”\n“Male dogs are easier to train than female dogs.”\n“Female dogs are easier to train than male dogs.”\n“Female dogs are easier to train than male dogs.”\nDespite these contradictions, there are some interesting trends. First of all, a great many of the respondents said that, in training and performance, the personality and background of any individual dog were more important factors than sex.\nAt this time there is no scientific research stating that female dogs are easier to train than male dogs. So, at times that may make a male dog easier to train than a female dog. If a dog is not spayed or neutered they will be more easily distracted by their environment due to natural dog behavior that comes along with being intact. An unneutered male will likely be more difficult to train. Some characteristics that make a dog harder or easier to train is their breed, their age, and genetics.\nYour dog’s wag and paw preference say a lot about their personality.\nOther consistencies in the responses lead to compelling questions in their own right. Many of the answers expressed the belief that male dogs mature more slowly than female dogs, describing young male dogs as “goofy,” “slow to mature,” and “less focused than female dogs” in theiradolescence. This is an especially interesting observation given that in our own species, girls are known to mature faster than boys.\nAnother contrast drawn between male and female dogs was that male dogs perform better in certain types of competition. From herding to Schutzhund to retrieving, whether we like it or not, they dominate the winner’s box. Based on their names, 12 of 15 winners of the last 15 years of International Sheepdog Trials were male and two were female (one could have been either). Since 1990, 19 dogs have won the U.S. National Open Retriever Championships. Sixteen were male dogs, two were female dogs, and one is still “unknown” (to me, that is; I’m sure someone knows!). This trend is replicable in many of the highly competitive performance sports, especially those that involve large sums of money.\nDoes it matter if the dogs are neutered?\nIt's challenging to tease out why male dogs perform better in competition. One logical explanation has nothing to do with the ability or competitiveness of either sex. Dog-related sports, like herding and retrieving, involve a lot of money, and in almost all of them, intact, potentially breeding male dogs and female dogs compete, neverneutered or spayedanimals. (This raises a complication not addressed in the original question — when we say male dogs, are we talking intact breeding males, or neutered male dogs? Given that there is so little real data on the question of sex, we’ll have to leave this aspect aside for now, but it is important to acknowledge that intact versus neutered could be an important factor.)\nIf you are running intact animals, as almost all high-powered handlers do in competition, the sex clearly has an effect on which sex you’re going to invest in. You can’t run a female dog when she’s in heat, and neither is it wise, or ethical for that matter, to run a female dog when she’s in the latter stages of pregnancy or nursing a litter. Who wants to invest large amounts of time and money in a performer who can do her job only half the time?\nIn addition, many competitors breed and train their dogs for a living. Say you own more than one top-notch performer. You will surely ask yourself which animal could best support your kennel and buy the dog food — a male dog who can be bred several times a week for a hefty stud fee? Or a female dog who might produce one (regrettably, sometimes two) litters of puppies a year?\nAnother explanation is that there is indeed something about a male dog that makes him more competitive under pressure. Testosterone is a powerful drug, and we know it has broad-ranging effects on assertive and aggressive behavior in species as different as rhesus macaque monkeys and mallard ducks (not to mention traders on the stock market, who are more successful if they have longer ring fingers than middle fingers — which is believed to correlate with the production of male hormones in utero. No kidding.)\nHow human perception plays a role\nThere’s another possible influence on the behavior of male and female dogs, but this time it relates toourbehavior. How much of our demeanor around dogs is based on our expectations of “maleness” and “femaleness”? But are these expectations based solely on culture? Or is some of a dog’s personality determined by their sex, as with the obvious sex-related behaviors like scent marking, roaming, and interspecies conflict?\nWhy pups' behavior may change when you’re expecting.\nThe bottom line: More research is needed\nHere’s what wedoknow: This is a topic that calls for research. Dogs are finally coming out of the woodwork as interesting and important in our search to understand the biology of behavior, and this is a perfect vehicle for study. What’s shocking is that we know so little about canine behavior, and what’s exciting is that there is so much to learn.\nFor example, Dr. Anneke Lisberg just completed her PhD from the University of Wisconsin on scent-marking behavior in dogs, a topic we know shockingly little about. Dr. Camille Ward completed her University of Michigan dissertation on social development and play behavior in puppies. These are but two examples of the kind of rigorous science-based studies that dogs deserve. But we need more, lots more, and I hope the trend of investing time and resources into the study of canine behavior continues to gather steam.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nTechnically, there isn’t a healthier sex. Health problems typically, but not always, depend on breeding and genetics. At times, due to the larger size of male dogs, they may suffer more from joint issues.\nBoth male and female dogs can show traits of dominance. I have found that it will really depend on the dog. Non-neutered males are typically more dominant than the latter. But some female dogs can show dominant personality traits.\nFemale dogs often show certain behaviors while going through a cycle. They may show higher levels of aggression during a cycle. At times, spaying a dog can help decrease aggression because it can lower that behavior.\nMale does are more likely to mark territory indoors especially if they are not neutered. Female dogs may also mark indoors if they are not spayed. Male or female dogs may mark indoors if another dog has marked or urinated in the spot and it was not properly cleaned.",

  "page_content": "Welcome to the ultimate showdown: cats versus dogs. It’s a debate as old as time, and it’s not about to be settled anytime soon (because both are great). If you’re thinking about bringing a pet into your life, you’re in for a real treat. But whether you’re “team cat” or “team dog,” there are some key things you should know before you make a decision about which pet is right for you.\nBoth cats and dogs make great pets, but they can have vastly different personalities, needs, and care requirements. Cats are generally less active than dogs and require less exercise (thoughexercise is greatfor them). They’re also generally more independent, though of course every cat is different, and youcouldhave a real cuddle bug on your hands. Dogs tend to require more exercise and attention (snuggles, anyone?). But dogs can also be more destructive and aggressive than cats. So, which one is right for you? That depends on a few factors.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nWhether you resonate with the independent charm of cats or the effervescent warmth of dogs, both bring immense joy to our lives in their own delightful way.

We’re not here foranynegativity toward either cats or dogs, but when it comes down to it, there are some general things to consider about being a dog or cat parent.\nIndependence: Cats are independent creatures, capable of entertaining themselves and staying alone while you travel.

Take the independent nature of cats, for example. One person might see this as a major benefit because they want a pet who has an easy time self-entertaining, while another person might see this as a disadvantage because they want a companion who gives themallthe attention. Personal preference and lifestyle play a huge role when deciding between a cat and a dog.\nCat vs. dog: care\nWhen we look at the different needs of cats and dogs, care is an important aspect to consider. From a health perspective, both cats and dogs need regularveterinary care, and those vet visits can add up quickly, so make sure that piggy bank is stocked before you welcome any four-legged friend into your home. They also both require daily feedings with a balanced diet and fresh water. But outside of vet visits and feeding requirements, dogs tend to need more care than cats.\nYou’ll want to ensure your pup has daily exercise, which means afew walks, a couple play sessions, and maybe a good romp at the park. Training andsocializationare also part of the package, ensuring your dog is well-behaved and gets along well with other people and pets. Grooming needsvary by dog breed, but expect some brushing and occasional baths. And last but not least, dogs need loads of love and attention — they thrive on it.\nAccording to animal behaviorist Karen London, using a more specific terms like“biddable”or“bombproof” can help you better understand your dog.\nThe care requirements for cats are, by no means, easy, but they are lower-maintenance pets by nature. First and foremost, ensuring they have a litter box that’s cleaned regularly is essential — no one wants a dirty bathroom or a stinky house. It’s also important to fulfill your kitty’s need to scratch…a lot. Havingscratching postsor pads around your house can save your furniture from their fury. While cats are relatively low maintenance, they do enjoy playtime, sointeractive toysare a hit. And lastly, don’t forget to have plenty of cozy spots for them to curl up and nap — they’re experts in the art of relaxation.\nIt’s important to look at the different lifestyles that are compatible with cats and dogs. If you have the time to dedicate to daily walks, training sessions, and games of fetch, being a dog parent might just be the move for you. If you’re more into the sit-back-relax-and-occasionally-cuddle lifestyle, a cat is probably more your speed.\nHere’s how to help your rescue kitty feel at home.\nCat vs. dog: behavior\nComparing cat and dog behavior is a bit like comparing apples to oranges. While both cats and dogs have their own quirks, individual personalities and breeds play a significant role. Generally, dogs are the daylight adventurers, ready for agame of fetchor a brisk walk around the block. Cats are the daytime dreamers, masters of catnaps and contemplation. But when night time comes around, cats often come to life, chasing imaginary prey orzoomingthrough the house like tiny tornadoes. Dogs are dependable extroverts and thrive on social interaction, while cats are enigmatic introverts who strongly value their “me time.”\nAs far as mischief goes, cats can be the masterminds behind some playful chaos, like knocking over your favorite vase just because it looked at them funny. Dogs, however, might dive headfirst into more serious trouble territory, from barking marathons and aggression tochewing exploitsand accidentalpee puddles. The good thing is that proper training can work wonders for both dog and catbehavioral issues.\nCat vs. dog: personality\nWhen looking at cat and dog personality traits, each brings their own set of unique characteristics to the table. Cats tend to be independent spirits, masters of lounging and self-entertainment. They’ll curl up in your lap when they’re in the mood, but are equally content going solo. They’re also stealthy and mysterious, often serving that aloof side-eye, but it’s all part of their ever so slightly cryptic charm.\nDogs, on the other hand, are all about the social scene. They’re your adventure buddies, always ready for a game oftug-of-waror walk in the park. They wear their hearts on their furry sleeves and are the eternal optimists, showering you with tail wags and slobbery kisses.\nYou could solve the mystery that is your kitty.\nCat vs. dog: intelligence\nPeople have strong opinions when it comes to theintelligence of cats versus dogs. Some assume that cats are smarter because of their fearless independence and impressive problem-solving skills. Others believe that a dog’s trainable nature and ability to work jobs like search and rescue mean that canines have all the brains. But the truth is that it’s a little more complicated than that.\nIt comes down to how intelligence is defined. Because we can’t really compare cat and dog IQs, we look at three different types of intelligence: cognitive, emotional, and practical. Cognitive intelligence is about problem-solving and learning from experience; emotional intelligence is related to understanding and responding to emotions, and practical intelligence involves applying skills effectively to survive. In general, cats tend to have higher practical intelligence with their sharp hunting skills, while dogs are moreemotionally intelligentgiven their ability to understand humans.\nCat vs. dog: body language\nAn animal’s body language can tell you a lot about how they’re feeling and what they’re about to do. Ever see a dog’s ears flip back and tail wag before they make a playful leap? That’sbody language. For both cats and dogs, their body parts literally speak for them. They use theireyes, ears, tails, mouths, and posture to communicate.\nAlthough they may use the same body parts to send a message, the meaning behind those movements isn’t always the same. Take ears for example. When a cat’sears go back, that typically means they’re afraid, angry, or feeling uncomfortable. When a dog’s ears go backslightly, that likely means they’re feeling friendly, especially when this is accompanied by a wagging tail. If a dog’s ears are pinned back sharply and they’re gritting their teeth and tucking their tail, this can indicate that they’re feelingdefensive.\nTurns out, even experts have a hard time defining these terms.\nHere are some other differences between cat and dog body language to help you decode their feelings:\nTail talk: Cats use their tails to share their feelings. When you see a cat’s tail twitching or fluffed up, it might mean they’re a bit agitated. Meanwhile, dogs are tail-wagging champions, expressing their excitement and joy through this spirited movement.\nTail talk: Cats use their tails to share their feelings.

Dogs, on the other hand, can’t contain their enthusiasm and might bound over to you or even jump up to say “hello.”\nApproach style: Cats like to keep their cool, often approaching with a slow slink or graceful prowl. Dogs, on the other hand, can’t contain their enthusiasm and might bound over to you or even jump up to say “hello.”\nCat vs. dog: cost\nThe cost of having a pet can vary widely depending on factors like size, breed, and overall health. But generally, dogs tend to be a bit more expensive to care for than cats, though every cat and their needs are different. Dogs typically need more food, grooming, and medical attention, which can add up over time. Dog parents will also potentiallyspend moreon training, boarding, and pet-sitting services. Cats, on the other hand, are more independent, needing less attention and time. What we do know is that the love and companionship you receive from both cats and dogs ispriceless.\nIt covers your pet so you can get that broken leg fixed — while keeping your wallet happy.\nKey differences between cats and dogs\nFrom care needs and cost to body language and behavior, there are plenty of differences between cats and dogs. While these characteristics can vary by the individual pet, here are the key takeaways:\nCats are independent, while dogs are more dependent.\nCats are independent, while dogs are more dependent.\nCats are lower-maintenance overall, while dogs require a different kind of care and attention.\nCats are lower-maintenance overall, while dogs require a different kind of care and attention.\nCats prefer solitary pursuits, while dogs provide more companionship and emotional bonding.\nCats prefer solitary pursuits, while dogs provide more companionship and emotional bonding.\nCats typically live longer than dogs.\nCats typically live longer than dogs.\nIf you’re still trying to decide between a cat and a dog, ask yourself: Does having a pint-sized enigma wrapped in fur as your companion sound like fun to you? Then cat parent it is. If a life filled with wagging tails, wet noses, and adventures with a boundless-joy-filled beast sounds more appealing, “team dog” might be more your style. Whether you’re a cat person, dog person, or both, one thing’s for sure — there will be no shortage of love and laughter in your life.\nAt the end of the day, as much as we might want to put our companions into boxes based on characteristics like behavior, care, and personality, it’s not black and white — each one comes with their own unique set of qualities, and that’s what makes them so special.\nWe all have our talents.\nFAQs (people also ask):\nWhile certain dog breeds make great apartment pets (think Shih Tzus, Yorkshire Terriers, and Chihuahuas), cats are generally better pets for apartment living because they require less space and don’t make as much noise. With that said, dogs are extremely trainable, and if you put in the effort to train them and provide lots of enrichment and exercise every day, they might be just fine.\nWhile both cats and dogs use body language to communicate, they’re pretty different in how they express themselves. Cats often use subtle body language to convey their feelings. A cat with a twitching tail might be a bit agitated, whileslow blinksare a sign of trust and affection. Felines also purr when they’re feeling content or seeking attention. Dogs, on the other hand, are more overt in their communication.\nTail waggingusually signifies excitement and happiness, but it can also mean stress or anxiety. They bark to express various emotions (much to our dismay sometimes), whether they’re defending your home against the mailman or wanting some playtime. Regardless of whether you have a cat or a dog, understanding your pet’s body language is key to building a strong bond.\nOn average, cats tend to live longer than dogs. Many cats live into their late teens, and some even reach their 20s. While factors like breed, genetics, and overall health play a role, indoor cats typically have a longer life expectancy because they have less exposure to risks, such as accidents and diseases. The lifespan of dogs varies significantly by breed and size.\nOn average, dogs typically live around 10 to 13 years, though some smaller breeds can live as long as 15 years. Providing them with a balanced diet, regular exercise, and routine veterinary care can help extend your dog’s life.",

  "page_content": "As kids, we were taught to ask permission before petting a dog with some variation of “May I please meet your dog?” As adults, we have T-shirts and hats that say, “Tell your dog I said ‘hi.’” But when did we start thinking it was OK to excitedly approach a dog with a big ol’ pet on the head, sans warning?\nDo we, as humans, especially after years of social distancing, love a non-consensual pat on the head (seriously, who would do that?) or hug? No. We like to be asked. And so do dog parents who are out in public with their pups.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nRead Between the Lines\nThis simple question has the potential to avoid unpleasant interactions, but only if kids (and adults) are taught how to interpret the possible answers, especially those that are nuanced. The answer might be a simple “Yes.” It could also be a straightforward “No“ for any number of reasons: It’s not safe to pet the dog, the dog will feel uncomfortable if the child attempts to interact, or even that someone is on a tight schedule and doesn’t have time for a meet-and-greet. The person may also seem hesitant but not actually say “No” or give an answer that conveys serious concern.The clear “Yes” answers are easy to figure out. It’s common for people to reply to a request to meet a dog with some variant of “Sure, she loves people!” “He would love that!” or “Absolutely; thanks for asking!” In that case, there is a good chance that the person expects a positive interaction between a person and a dog. They might be wrong, but there’s no sense of worry or concern being expressed, which is encouraging, and it makes sense for people to approach the dog.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nSimilarly, a definite “No” from the person is also clear. If a person declines the request, people should respect that and not approach the dog. Common ways that people prevent an interaction are by saying, “I’m sorry, but people make her nervous,” “She’s too shy; it will upset her,” or “I think maybe no, because everything scares her.” They might even say, “No, because she’ll try to bite you.” People who answer in this general way know that the dog can’t handle it and that it would be a mistake to let someone meet her.\nUnfortunately, there are two general categories of answers that can be ambiguous, and too few children have been taught to understand them. The first set of such answers is generally positive with mild reservations. These usually indicate that the people are not concerned about their dog being aggressive, but they feel embarrassed about some aspect of their dog. These replies are along the lines of, “OK, but she’s very excitable,” or “Yes, but she may jump on you.”\nSometimes, people just offer a warning that is not behavioral, such as “If you don’t mind getting a lot of fur on you!” In most cases, these responses are not deal breakers. If the person expresses that their dog is unruly or shedding, it’s OK to answer, “I don’t mind dog hair,” or “I don’t think jumping up will put a dark blot on her character!” Just consider whether the dog is not so powerful or out of control that someone could get knocked over. This requires a judgment call, and the most conservative approach is to choose not to meet dogs after such replies. At the very least, proceed with caution.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a shy pup to go from wallflower to social butterfly.\nAnother set of answers can be more worrisome, and people need to learn that they should not pet a dog if the dog’s parent says things along the lines of, “That wouldprobablybe OK,” or “Well, she’s shy, but we can see how she does,” or “If she’ll let you. I’m not sure because sometimes she can’t handle it.” All of these replies show that a person is in the hope-and-fear zone. (“I hope it will be OK, but I fear that it will not be.”) There is a great risk that the interaction could not end well for the person or the dog.\nGood Rules of Thumb\nKids, who can often scare dogs, should be taught that the correct action upon hearing such remarks is not to approach the dog. A simple, “Oh, that’s OK. I wouldn’t want to upset her, but thanks anyway,” is a good phrase to use in those situations.There are endless possible answers when a person asks, “May I please meet your dog?” The “Yes” and the “No” replies are easy to understand. The former tells you it’s likely to be a positive interaction and the latter lets you know that the person knows the dog can’t handle it and has clearly said so. It’s those intermediate answers that require more careful interpretation. If the answer gives any hint that it might not go well or might distress the dog, it’s best to decline.\nWith patience and positive reinforcement, you can do a lot to make up for lost time with socialization.\nOf course, all of this general advice assumes that people have the right read on their dog, and that is not always the case. They may think the dog loves all people, even when the dog’s body language reveals that they are terrified and wants someone to go away. That’s why it’s still important for passersby to learn how to tell that a dog is behaving in a fearful and/or threatening way.\nDog parents’ responses to a request to meet a dog are only one stream of information we can use to decide whether to approach a dog. Still, there’s often a lot of truth in what they say, which is why we should evaluate those responses and act accordingly.",

  "page_content": "Dogs may not always seem to hear what we are saying, but they are mostdefinitelylistening. A a September 2022 study called“Language Preference in the Domestic Dog”in the journalAnimal Cognitioninvestigated dogs’ ability to distinguish between different languages, and it turns out, they can.\nThe study\nThe researchers asked a simple question: “Can dogs tell the difference between English and Spanish?” Scientists already knew that human infants distinguish different languages based on rhythmic cues, and the same ability has also been found in cotton-top tamarins (a species of monkey weighing half a kilogram that lives in Colombia) as well as in rats. Those species do not have long-term language exposure like dogs do, making studies of dogs’ responses to different languages relatable to studies of babies. Dogs, like babies, are always hearing people talk, making dogs an ideal species for studying the role of exposure to language in both language discrimination and language preference.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nTikTok pet parents have made this clear: Tone matters. Celebrity dog trainer Nicole Ellis says dogs can hear “stress in our voice — whether directed at them or when they hear us talking to others.”\nThe dogs in the study all lived in households in which either English or Spanish was the primary language spoken. So, each dog was used to one language, and the other language was new to them. From a linguistic perspective, the many differences between English and Spanish include differences in the length of time it takes to say each syllable. In Spanish, most syllables are of similar length but in English, unstressed syllables are shortened, while ending vowels are lengthened. These variations on syllable length lead to different rhythms in spoken language. For anyone seeking more terminology in their daily life, Spanish is a “syllable-timed” language and English is a “stress-timed” language.\nAll dogs, no matter which language they were used to hearing at home, were tested to assess their responses to both English and Spanish for comparison purposes. Each dog heard 22 seconds of fairy tales in each language. The fairy tales were read by a woman who is a native speaker of both English and Spanish and who was unfamiliar to the dogs. The dogs were in a sound booth while the stories were read to them, and the researchers recorded how long they oriented toward the speaker where the sound of the story was coming from.\nSay What? A look at the types of words that dogs understand.\nTurns out, dogs are good with change\nDogs in both English-speaking homes and in Spanish-speaking homes were able to tell apart the two languages. Spanish-hearing dogs listened longer to English and English-hearing dogs listened longer to Spanish, a result that shows a novelty effect of the dogs’ language preference. In other words, they were more attentive to an unfamiliar language than the one they are used to hearing. An interest in and acceptance of novelty is part of what allows dogs to be our companions and family members. Many species are afraid of anything new, which makes them unable to cope in human society, but the domestic dog is exceptionally good at accepting new things, whether that is sounds, sights, people, or routines, when compared to other species.\nInterestingly, though babies prefer their native language to an unknown language, babies have preferences for novelty over the familiar for non-linguistic stimuli. Maybe puppies would also prefer the familiar over the unfamiliar language, and that would be interesting to study in the future. (The dogs in this study were all adults with an average age of nearly five years old.) Evidence of this idea is that dogs prefer thesound of their own nameover the sound of another name or over the sound of their own name mispronounced. Maybe both babies and dogs prefer familiar language when it is meaningful to them as language but unfamiliar stimuli in other cases.\nYour dog might not know your name. Don’t take offense; just play this game.\nSo, how did dogs pick up English vs. Spanish?\nResearchers do not yet know whether dogs used rhythmic cues or phonological cues to tell the languages apart. They could have recognized familiar words in the stories in the language they were most familiar with, although researchers took care to avoid stories with words dogs were most likely to know such as “walk” or “treat.”\nThere is still so much to learn about the responses and reactions of dogs to different languages. For now, we know that we can say either “I love you” or “Te amo” to dogs, and they will know the difference, even if we are expressing exactly the same feeling.",

  "page_content": "Does your dog spend all day sleeping? Even if that sounds like theperfectday to you, should they be snoozing for that long? And how much sleepdoesa dog need? Learn about dog sleep habits and the reasons why your dog sleeps a lot.\nDogs need a lot of sleep! The average dog sleeps for about 12 to 14 hours a day. However, there are a few factors that can affect how much sleep a dog needs, including theirage, breed, and activity level. If your dog is sleeping more or less than the recommended amount, it is important to talk to your veterinarian. There may be an underlying medical condition that is causing your dog to sleep more or less than usual.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nHow much sleep do dogs need?\nIf you’re a first-timedog parent, you might be surprised by just how much sleep your dog needs. The average dog will sleep between 12 to 14 hours a day. This is generally made up of day-time naps and overnight sleep.\nPuppies sleep longer than average, typically sleeping 18 to 20 hours a day until around 12 weeks of age. Later, as dogs start to reach their senior years, they will sleep more as their bodies and minds tire more quickly. Size, activity, age, and health are all factors in how much sleep a dog needs but most pet parents should expect their adult dog tosleepat least half of the day.\nIt’s a personal preference, but here are the pros and cons.\nIn astudyon dogs’ sleep patterns, a team of researchers looked into the effects of age and feeding frequency on dogs’ sleep patterns. Dogs were grouped into one of three age ranges (1.5 to 4.5 years, 7 to 9 years, 11 to 14 years) and were fed once or twice daily.Researchers found that older and middle-aged dogs slept more during the day than young adult dogs, but that was because they took more naps and not because their naps were longer. Older and middle-aged dogs also slept more at night than younger dogs because they had a longer total sleep interval at night (waking up later) and woke up fewer times during the night.\nDogs of all ages were affected similarly by being fed twice daily instead of once a day. Dogs fed more frequently took fewer naps during the day, but the naps lasted longer. Dogs fed twice a day fell asleep earlier at night but woke up earlier, too, with a decrease in total time sleeping at night.\nIs it OK if my dog sleeps all day?\nRegardless of a dog’s life stage, many pet parents may wonder, “Is it OK that my dog sleeps all day?” The answer is typically yes. Your dog should spend about half of their day sleeping. As long as your dog is maintaining normal activity and food intake while awake, getting plenty of rest during the day is normal.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nYou should consult with your veterinarian if you notice an abrupt change in your dog’s sleep or waking behaviors. While the number of hours a dog sleeps will gradually shift during their life, it’s not normal for them to go from sleeping 12 hours a day to being a lump for 20 hours straight. Many illnesses can sap the energy out of a pup. Your dog should also be easy to wake and excited to perform their favorite activities when they’re up. See your vet if your dog is sleeping way more than usual, is very difficult to wake, or will not get up for enjoyable activities like meals or walks.\nWhy does my dog sleep so much?\nMuch like us, dogs need sleep to remain healthy. The human sleep cycle in a 24-hour period is fairly simple. We are awake during the daytime and have one long sleep at night. While we sleep, we cycle through restorative phases of REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM sleep. Sleep allows the body to restore tissue and strengthen the immune system.\nDuring REM, brain activity increases, and this is good for learning and development as well as retaining information and memories. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke states that during REM, the brain exercises important neural connections, which are key to mental and overall well-being.\nDogs have a more scattered sleep pattern within a 24-hour period, consisting of short naps throughout the day and a long sleep during the night. These periods of sleep are punctuated with waking up to check their environment and scan forchanges/dangers. Dogs enter into REM quicker than humans (which is why you often see them acting out dreams). However, one theory suggests that this constant state of readiness leads to less REM sleep, causing dogs to need to sleep more in order to feel restored.\nFour signs your puppy is ready for a nap.\nWhen dogs don’t get enough sleep, they can become sleep deprived; common symptoms from lack of sleep may start to appear, though they’re not as easy to notice as they are in people.\nWhat if my dog is restless at night and won’t sleep?\nIf your dog is restless at night and won’t sleep, start by evaluating your dog’s environment and routine. Make any necessary adjustments to establish a routine with set times for meals, walks, and play. This may help your dog expend enough energy by nighttime. Make sure your dog’senvironmentis conducive to sleep with minimal stressors. If your dog is still restless at night despite these adjustments, then talk to your vet. Your dog may have a true sleep disruption problem.\nIf your dog isn’t napping during the day and is consistently restless at night, that’s not normal. A lack of sleep may cause them to be whiny, sluggish, or disinterested in play. Displaying these symptoms on occasion is okay, and you can allow for a cranky day once in a while. If the behavior persists, it's cause for concern.\nIf hypothyroidism is to blame, it’s bestnotto let sleeping dogs lie.\nDogs who have severe sleep disorders will exhibit more concerning behaviors such as excessive whining or crying, becoming disoriented when performing basic tasks, or becoming aggressive because they are increasingly on edge from the lack of rest. You may notice your dog becoming more irritable and agitated. On the flip-side, they could begin to withdraw socially and stop engaging as they previously would have.\nSigns that your dog isn’t getting enough sleep can come on suddenly or gradually. Any symptoms that are concerning should be discussed with your veterinarian to rule out the possibility of medical issues.\nReasons your dog can’t sleep\nYour dog may be suffering from insomnia for a number of reasons:\nPainful arthritis could be causing insomnia as your dog cannot be still and feel comfortable. Prescribed pain relief, special massage treatments, or different bedding could help. Sleep apnea, which is commonly seen in flat-faced and obese dogs, will cause a dog to jolt awake when their airway is blocked. Multiple sleep interruptions can be frustrating and leave a dog feeling constantly tired. After a vet has ruled out any medical issues, the next step is to look at other possible causes for your dog’s restlessness.\nA lack of exercise is the root cause of many behavioral issues. Your dog needs an outlet to expend energy. Depending on your dog’s age and energy level, the amount of exercise they need can vary, but it is key to understand the type of dog you have and meet that required amount of exercise.\nA lack of exercise and enrichment can lead to a buildup of energy and frustration. As well as being destructive or demotivated, dogs can also become agitated and anxious, creating sleep problems. When you add insufficient sleep to those feelings, things can escalate quickly. A tired dog equals a sleeping dog.\nNot that anyone’s complaining...\nAnxiety is another leading cause of sleeping problems. Dogs can feel anxious for all sorts of reasons. Getting to the bottom of the anxiety is the healthiest way to get your dog’s sleep into a regular pattern. Here are some common causes of anxiety in dogs:\nNew surroundings\nNew surroundings\nSeparationfrom companion(s)\nSeparationfrom companion(s)\nChanges to the family — new additions or people/animals leaving\nChanges to the family — new additions or people/animals leaving\nNeglect\nNeglect\nFear\nFear\nLack of exercise\nLack of exercise\nScary sounds, such as fireworks, thunderstorms, or construction\nScary sounds, such as fireworks, thunderstorms, or construction\nForced socialization\nForced socialization\nPast trauma\nPast trauma\nAll dogs are individuals, and the cause of their anxiety could be something as seemingly innocuous as the sound of the vacuum cleaner. Many dogs feel anxious when left alone or separated from their humans. When left alone, which is typically when dogs nap during the day, these dogs are pacing, whining, or looking out the window. Their cortisol levels are gradually rising and their anxiety is growing. They are never fully relaxed. If your dog is suffering from anxiety, speak to a qualified behaviorist or trainer on how best to make your dog feel more comfortable on their own.\nHere’s why your pup may get the winter blues, too.\nAre there sleep aids for dogs?\nIf your dog is having trouble sleeping, consult with your veterinarian before pursuing sleeping aids for your dog. Underlying medical issues should be ruled out first. A dog may be up at night because of underlying pain or sudden urges to urinate or defecate. A sleep aid isn’t the most appropriate treatment for those conditions, and addressing the underlying issue can certainly help your pup get better sleep. Older dogs may develop a neurological or cognitive disease that causes confusion and sleepless nights. In these cases, finding a remedy (prescription or over the counter) may take a bit of trial and error, but your veterinarian can make recommendations to help.\nThe bottom line: If your dog sleeps intermittently during the day and throughout the night, that’s a good sign. It likely means they are getting plenty of exercise, they have a well-balanced and healthy diet, and they are extremely content and feel safe in their surroundings.\nFAQs (people also ask):\nWhile dogs are naturally diurnal and get long stretches of sleep at night, they also take plenty of naps during the day. Establishing routine for meals, walks, and exercise can help normalize your dog’s sleep schedule.\nHelp your dog get quality sleep by making sure they get enough exercise and routine vet care so that issues that may impact sleep are caught early. Providing a safe,comfortable, low-stress environment can also help your dog get quality sleep.\nKeep in mind that your dog needs 12 to14 hours of sleep per day, so make sure you let them get plenty of rest. It’s okay to wake your dog up for meals, exercise, or other activities. Consult with your vet if your dog is difficult to wake.\nReferences:\nThe Cyclic Interaction between Daytime behavior and the Sleep Behavior of Laboratory Dogs\nThe Cyclic Interaction between Daytime behavior and the Sleep Behavior of Laboratory Dogs\nCharacterizing Behavioral Sleep Using Actigraphy in Adult Dogs of Various Ages Fed Once or Twice Daily\nCharacterizing Behavioral Sleep Using Actigraphy in Adult Dogs of Various Ages Fed Once or Twice Daily\nSleep in the Dog: Comparative, Behavioral and Translational Relevance\nSleep in the Dog: Comparative, Behavioral and Translational Relevance",

  },
  "page_content": "One of the best feelings in the world is your dog snuggling up to you, whether you’re relaxing watching TV orstretched out in bed. But sometimes dogs seem more interested in cozying up to your feet instead of settling in for pets. Should you be worried if your pup settles all their weight on your feet?\nThe short answer: no. It’s perfectly normal for dogs to lay on their human parents’ feet for a number of reasons, some of which go all the way back to their wolf ancestry. Your dog may be feeling nervous, acting affectionate, or simply trying to steal some of your warmth. Kinship answers the question “Why does a dog sit on your foot?” and whether this behavior is ever a cause for concern.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nFive Reasons Your Dog Lays at Your Feet\nDogs are pack animals, and snuggling up to members of their pack (e.g., you) is normal behavior, although there are many reasons dogs sleep at your feet, from a sense ofemotional connectionto a bid for comfort. Dogs like to stay as close as possible to their loved ones, andresearchshows that they see their parents in the same way a human child does. That’s right, your dog definitely thinks of you as Mom or Dad — someone who provides love, shelter, and (maybe most importantly) food.\nSo, why do dogs like to lay on your feet? Below are the five most common reasons for this behavior.\nDogs need more sleep than humans. Here’s how much is healthy.\nHumans sometimes show affection by snuggling up, and your dog may be doing the same thing. Dogs have evolved over time to have higher levels ofoxytocin(known as the “love hormone”), which encourages bonding and can be released during physical closeness. In short, your dog is genetically predisposed to bond with you and feel affection toward you.\nYour dog likely feels safe around you, which they may demonstrate by sitting on your feet and gazing up at you with those big, adoring eyes. Because they feel secure and comfortable around you, they’re more able to relax and may do so by laying on your feet. It’s your dog’s way of saying, “This is my special person.”\nAs charming as dogs can be when they’re feeling affectionate, sometimes they lay on your feet simply to take advantage of your body heat. Compared to other animals, dogs don’t have as much body fat to keep them warm, and their bodies radiate heat more quickly than those of humans. While your dog certainly loves you, they may also lay on your feet to use you as a convenient heating pad. If you notice your dog shivering regularly in the colder months, consider buying them a jacket orsweater.\nIt’s a personal preference, but here are the pros and cons.\nIn some cases, dogs sit or lay on their human parents’ feet to show exactly who’s in charge or to let everyone else know that you belong to them. If your dog has a tendency toward showing a bit of an attitude, they may lay on your feet as a sign of dominance.\nDogs have an innate instinct to protect their resources that goes back to their wild ancestors. For modern dogs, this can translate to guarding their resources (aka you) from other pets or family members. Usually, this behavior is accompanied by defensive actions like growling, snapping, or even lunging at anyone who comes near, so watch out for signs of aggression.\nDo dogs lay on your feet to claim territory?\nWhy do dogs put their head on your feet? Part of the pack mentality is protecting other members of the pack, so your dog may lay on your feet to guard you and claim you as theirs. If your dog sits on your feet in public spaces, like the local park, this could definitely be a sign of your dog marking territory. Fortunately, this behavior isn’t really an issue unless you havemultiple dogs in your home. If your pups fight over who gets to sit closest to you or lay on your feet, you may need to consult a dog behaviorist to avoid aggression leading to injury.\nShould I encourage or discourage this behavior?\nIn most cases, your dog snuggling up to your feet is a sign of affection and trust, not a cause for concern. Enjoy the coziness of your dog sitting on your feet and recognize it as a sign of how deep your bond really is.\nHowever, if your dog is always underfoot, this behavior can become a bit of a nuisance. You can use positive reinforcement to discourage your dog from sitting or laying on your feet and train them to sit a little farther away with the use of treats and praise.\nFour signs your puppy is ready for a nap.\nWhat does it mean if my dog sleeps at my feet?\nLaying on your feet is one thing, but why do dogs sleep at your feet? If your dog sleeps at your feetin bedat night, they’re likely seeking support and comfort from your presence. Or they’re trying to soak up your body heat to stay warm. Either way, having a dog snuggled up to youwhile you sleepcan be a heart-warming feeling and a sign that they trust you and feel safe when you’re nearby.\nFAQs (People also ask)\nDogs tend to lay at the feet of those they trust deeply and love, so they usually engage in this behavior with their human parents. If your dog spends a lot of time with a family member or friend, like a pet sitter, they may engage in this behavior with that person as well.\nWhen a dog is new to your home, they may keep their distance until they feel comfortable. Once they become more attached to you, your dog may begin laying on your feet more regularly. And some dogs may simply not show affection in this way or do so only sporadically.\nIf your dog begins laying on your feet more often, they’re most likely growing more attached to you, which is definitely a good sign! However, if your pet also exhibits signs of anxiety or fear, there may be a deeper issue that you should discuss with your vet.\nResources\nThe Importance of a Secure Base Effect for Domestic Dogs - Evidence from a Manipulative Problem-Solving Task\nThe Importance of a Secure Base Effect for Domestic Dogs - Evidence from a Manipulative Problem-Solving Task\nWolves to dogs: Study finds canine affection for humans linked to oxytocin sensitivity\nWolves to dogs: Study finds canine affection for humans linked to oxytocin sensitivity",

  },
  "page_content": "Does your dog seem hypnotized by hanging objects? No, you dangling a piece of bacon over their bowl doesn’t count — anyone would go into a trace fromthat.This is more about something called trance-like syndrome in dogs. Dog trancing is a behavioral phenomenon in which dogs walk slowly and deliberately under objects that barely touch their backs. It is often described as a“trance-like”state, and dogs may appear to be focused on an object above them. Dog trancing is a harmless behavior in most cases. But if you are ever concerned about your dog’s behavior, it is always best to consult with your veterinarian.\nThe first time you notice your dog slowly creeping beneath a low-hanging branch or a dangling tablecloth, head moving languorously side-to-side and a far-away look in their eyes, you might worry that it heralds a seizure or points toobsessive-compulsive tendencies. But once the pup has performed this ritual repeatedly with no apparent ill effects to health (theirs) or property (yours), you may simply wonder what causes this hypnosis-like behavior.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nA fascination with lights and shadows is common in high-energy dogs — but it can develop into obsessive-compulsive disorder if it gets out of hand.\nIn fact, experts say that trance-like syndrome (TLS) — also referred to as “ghost-walking,” “weed-walking,” or simply “trancing” — is usually a benign canine quirk. But why do our furry friends act this way in the presence of low-hanging objects, and are there any situations in which this ritual indicates an illness or behavioral issue?\nWhat is trancing?\nExperts refer to the manner in which dogs move while experiencing TLS as “hypokinetic gait,” incredibly slow pacing characterized by soft, deliberate footfalls. This slo-mo walk seems to be stimulated by the dog passing under a plant or fabric hanging at head or back height. In some dogs, the sensation elicits a glassy-eyed gaze and affects the way they position their faces. “Their ears will be completely flat to the head, nose pointed up to the sky and eyes squinted,” veterinarian Dr. Michelle Burch explains.\nThey may evenpausetheir glacial mosey and stand stock-still for several seconds before resuming their pacing. Uninterrupted, this blissed-out state can last anywhere from several seconds to half an hour but is easily cut short by calling the pup’s name. Although some dogs may briefly exhibit annoyance at being yanked from their reverie, they quickly return to their normal selves.\nChasing their tails, eating grass, and rolling in garbage — should you worry?\nBased on current available research, these episodes are not thought to be seizure activity. Dogs with TLS do not have a postictal phase — the time period after a seizure when a dog may be confused, anxious, nauseous, or justoff.  Unlike a seizure, a TLS “spell” can be easily broken.\nAdditionally, anti-seizure medication does not prevent a dog from trancing.\nAlthough most common in Bull Terriers and sighthounds (such as Greyhounds and Salukis), TLS has been observed in multiple breeds and mixes. The behavior is also seen more commonly in dogs  display symptoms of canine compulsive disorder (CCD) like chasing their tail. It’s possible that there is a genetic component to these behaviors.\nWhy do dogs trance?\nVeterinarians and canine behaviorists are not sure what causes TLS. Seemingly, the light brush of line-drying clothes or foliage against their bodies activates feelings of happiness and tranquility. Some experts consider trancing to be a form of canine compulsive disorder, as many dogs who exhibit TLS are prone to other neurotic behaviors. There’s no conclusive evidence, however, that trancing is connected to a neurological issue.\nIn most cases, TLS behavior doesn’t mean anything’s wrong with the dog. Trancing behavior can appear strange and pose a mystery to canine experts, but in and of itself, it’s not an indication of health or behavioral problems. “If you do not see any other symptoms associated with trancing episodes,” Dr. Burch says, “I recommend not panicking and allowing them to finish their ritual.”\nA fascination with lights and shadows is common in high-energy dogs — but it can develop into obsessive-compulsive disorder if it gets out of hand.\nSo, if you spot your pal inching past the coat rack, running their back along jacket bottoms and scarves with a dreamy look on their face, don’t worry. It’s fairly safe to assume that their behavior, though odd, is entirely harmless.\nShould you see a vet if your dog is trancing?\nIf your dog is trancing occasionally and is otherwise normal, there is no need to rush to a vet. Talk to your vet if your dog zones out excessively or is displaying additional symptoms includingaggression, head pressing, trouble walking, muscle tremors,pain,vomiting, unresponsiveness to outside stimuli, or sudden unconsciousness. In these cases, your veterinarian may recommend diagnostic testing or a consultation with a veterinary neurologist.\n“Dogs who display such symptoms may have an underlying seizure disorder, metabolic abnormalities, or organ dysfunction,” Dr. Burch warns. It’s also a good idea to make certain that a dog’s trance-trigger of choice isn’t potentially damaging to their skin; a “massage” from a poisonous shrub, for example, could produce a painful rash.\nTheir toes might smell like Fritos, but there’s no way they tastethatgood.\nHow to manage dog trancing\nTrancing typically does not indicate a medical problem and does not require treatment. If you’re concerned, you can record one of your dog’s episodes to show your vet during a wellness visit to make sure that they don’t have any concerns. Otherwise, it’s fine to let your dog trance without interruption.\nFAQs (People Also Ask)\nWhile a dog’s trancing episodes may be concerning to some pet parents, trancing is considered harmless behavior and does not need to be discouraged. Keep a watchful eye and talk to your vet if you see other behavior changes or symptoms.\nSome dogs may enjoy tiptoeing in a trance-like state, but they are unlikely to becomeobsessedwith the behavior. Dogs with trance-like syndrome may trance weekly to every couple of months.\nResources\nTrance-like Syndrome in Bull Terriers",

  "page_content": "In general, you should not worry when your dog twitches in their sleep. Brief, intermittent twitching in your dog’s sleep is completely normal — and yes, your dog is dreaming, likely about the experiences of their day.\nWhat does it look like when a dog twitches in their sleep?\nWhen your dog twitches in their sleep, they may kick lightly at the air with a back leg, or a front limb may twitch. Sleep twitching usually happens in a dog’s legs, but they may also move their head or wag their tail. Usually, dogs are lying on their sides when twitching and may even move more than one paw in a paddling motion. You may also notice your dog’s eyes moving behind their closed lids, irregular breathing, and even vocalizing, like whimpers, low growls, or soft barks.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nIn most cases, twitching during sleep is completely normal for dogs and can happen during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep. During REM sleep, a part of the brain called the pons controls muscle movement, and sometimes it’s ineffective, leading to twitching. These small muscle spasms are more frequent inpuppies, who have less developed brains, and in senior dogs.\nSo, if you notice your dog keeps twitching in their sleep, don’t wake them and interrupt their deep snooze. You only need to worry if twitching becomes violent or lasts longer than 30 seconds.\nStages of a Dog’s Sleep Cycle\nDogs have the same sleep cycle as humans, just in a much shorter time frame. Researchers have found that thecanine sleep cycleincludes an average of 12 minutes of non-REM sleep followed by six minutes of REM sleep. Compare this to 90 minutes of non-REM sleep followed by 60 minutes of REM for humans.\nDuring REM sleep, dogs dream just like humans. Their breathing becomes shallower and more irregular, and their eyes might move behind their closed lids (this is where the “rapid eye movement” name comes from). Because dogs sleep significantly more than humans — about 12 to 14 hours a day — they’re moving through the sleep cycle multiple times, shifting in and out of deep sleep and puppy dreams, which can often lead to twitching\nWhile a dog sleeps, whether for a quick nap or a long, overnight snoozeburrowed under the covers, their brain processes the things they’ve seen and experienced throughout their day in dreams. Scientists know this because dogs have similar sleep patterns to humans, and their brains go through the same stages of electrical activity observed in dreaming humans.\nWe can’t know exactly what dogs dream about, butresearchershave observed some breeds performing behaviors specific to their breed. For example, sleeping Pointers tend to point! It’s most likely that a dog dreaming thinks about what they do during the day, like playing, going on walks, orsnuggling with their favorite human. That’s right, your dog could be dreaming about you.\nWhat causes dogs to twitch in their sleep?\nThere are several reasons why your dog twitches in their sleep, and while a harmless dream is the most likely, it’s important to be aware of other potential causes.\nDreaming is the most likely cause for your dog twitching in sleep, indicating that your pup is in the later stages of REM sleep.\nDreaming is the most likely cause for your dog twitching in sleep, indicating that your pup is in the later stages of REM sleep.\nMuscle spasms can be related to growth and development in puppies and can also occur in healthy senior dogs.\nMuscle spasms can be related to growth and development in puppies and can also occur in healthy senior dogs.\nPain could be the cause of twitching, especially stiffness or arthritis.\nPain could be the cause of twitching, especially stiffness or arthritis.\nMedical conditions, such as muscle or nervous system disorders, can cause twitching in dogs.Myokymiais a condition that causes twitching on a dog’s face during sleep but is usually harmless unless it also occurs when the dog is awake.\nMedical conditions, such as muscle or nervous system disorders, can cause twitching in dogs.Myokymiais a condition that causes twitching on a dog’s face during sleep but is usually harmless unless it also occurs when the dog is awake.\nAre there any cases where twitching during sleep is concerning?\nIn general, a dog twitching in their sleep is completely normal, and you should just “let sleeping dogs lie,” as the saying goes. Waking your dog from deep sleep can prevent them from getting enough rest, which can negatively impact their well-being. But there are a few signs to look out for that can indicate a more serious problem:\nLong periods of twitching: A dog’s sleep twitching shouldn’t last more than 30 seconds and should beintermittent.\nLong periods of twitching: A dog’s sleep twitching shouldn’t last more than 30 seconds and should beintermittent.\nViolent twitching: Tremors in your dog’s entire body or a dog shaking in their sleep could indicate a neurological issue.\nViolent twitching: Tremors in your dog’s entire body or a dog shaking in their sleep could indicate a neurological issue.\nTwitching that is accompanied by other symptoms, such as seizures or foaming at the mouth, is likely caused by a more serious health condition.\nTwitching that is accompanied by other symptoms, such as seizures or foaming at the mouth, is likely caused by a more serious health condition.\nWhen should I seek veterinary advice for my dog’s sleep twitching?\nIf you notice your dog’s entire body shaking when sleeping or that their body is more rigid, contact your veterinarian immediately. Stiff limbs and violent movement are often signs of seizures, which can be caused by a number of medical conditions, including epilepsy and cancer.\nA dog twitching in sleep is generally harmless. If you notice that your dog twitches frequently and for more than 30 seconds at a time, you may want to record their sleep so you can show the video to your vet.\nCan diet affect my dog’s sleep and twitching?\nResearch has not determined whether a dog’s diet can impact their sleep and result in more twitching. But if your dog consumes foods that are toxic to them, like chocolate, they can experience tremors or shivering. However, these behaviors are usually accompanied by other symptoms, such as vomiting and diarrhea. If you suspect that your dog has consumed atoxic foodor substance, contact your vet immediately.\nCan certain medications cause twitching in dogs during sleep?\nJust like their human parents, dogs can experience side effects from medications. While it’s unlikely that twitching can result from medication, in some rare cases, certain drugs, such as antibiotics, insulin, flea and tick medications, and anti-anxiety medications, can cause tremors. If you notice that your dog shakes in sleep, consult your veterinarian.\nRegular exercise can help your dog stay healthy, not just physically, but mentally, by reducing stress. Too much stress can lead to poor sleep, so ensuring that your dog gets plenty of exercise can help them sleep soundly.\nWhile seeing your dog twitch in their sleep can be concerning at first, thisbehavioris just part of their natural sleep cycle. So let your pup dream about chasing that rabbit, meeting friends at the dog park, or their favorite person in the world: you.\nFAQs (People Also Ask):\nDogs twitch in their sleep when they enter the late stages of REM sleep and are dreaming. You  may also hear your dog whimper during this sleep stage, or they may wag their tail.\nTwitching during sleep is perfectly normal for dogs and is not a cause for concern unless it becomes violent or more frequent.\nYou should avoid waking up your dog when they’re sleeping, even if they appear to be having anightmare. Touching a sleeping dog may startle them, and they could bite or scratch you involuntarily. If you do feel the need to wake your dog, call their name loudly or make a noise and then reassure them if they become startled.\nTwitching during sleep is only a cause for concern if it becomes violent or lasts longer than 30 seconds at a time.\nResearch hasn’t found whether a dog’s diet affects their sleep, but if a dog consumes toxic foods like chocolate, they can experience tremors and shivering and need to be taken to the vet immediately.\nIn rare cases, some medications can cause tremors in dogs.

  "page_content": "Changing any behavior takes time, patience, and dedication. When dogs are feeling mischievous,anxious, or stressed, they can cause a lot of damage — chewing shoes,counter surfing, scratching,barking— the list of undesirable behaviors goes on. Animal shelters are filled withpets abandonedbecause people don’t realize the time and dedication required to train good manners. While there is rarely a quick fix for anything, regular exercise can provide a huge benefit. Even with well-trained dogs, exercise matters if you want good behavior.\nWhat should you do about destructive dog behaviors?\nTraining obviously helps with problem behaviors, but it’s not the only way to avoid trouble. Dog trainers have long valued the role of exercise in minimizing destructive dog behaviors such asbarking, chewing,jumpingaround, being unable to settle down or sleep well, digging, whining, and relentless attention-seeking.Studiesshow that more exercise was correlated with lower levels of fear, lessaggressiontoward familiar dogs, and reduced excitability.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nCelebrity dog trainer Victoria Stilwell’s pro tips for keeping paws off your charcuterie platter this holiday season.\nIn one study, a group of dogs was divided in half; one half worked on formal training while the other half had their exercise increased to two 30-to-45-minute sessions a day. After six weeks, the dogs who had additional training showed improvements in both their responsiveness to cues and their problem behaviors. The dogs who had extra exercise also exhibited problem behaviors less frequently, although their responsiveness to cues had not improved. So, how does exercise affect behavior through physiological means?\nHow does exercise improve dog behaviors?\nLike people, dogs can achieve an emotional state described as a “runner’s high,” which may be why your pup is so excited for the chance to go out on a run. It may also be why so many people believe the old saying, “A tired dog is a good dog.” But these well-behaved and well-exercised dogs may be more influenced by chemistry than by fatigue.\nA runner’s high is caused by chemicals called endocannabinoids, which signal the reward centers of the brain. Endocannabinoids lessen both pain and anxiety as well as create feelings of well-being. Running triggers higher levels of these compounds, which is why running makes people (and dogs) feel good.\nHelpful tips on shaping up with your dog.\nIf you’re laughing at the thought and can’t imagine putting yourself through the misery of running on purpose, you aren’t alone. While most dogs are excited aboutrunning, humans, on the other hand — outside of a small percentage — aren’t interested. Still, thepotentialto activate the chemicals that cause a runner’s high exists within you — even if you aren’t dipping into it as frequently as your long-ago ancestors, for whom running long distances was part of daily life.\nThis pleasurable, rewarding quirk of chemistry is not universal among mammals. In astudyinvestigating the phenomenon of the “runner’s high,” researchers predicted that running would result in pleasurable chemical reactions in species with a history of endurance running. They studied three types of mammals — humans, dogs, and ferrets — and found that the two with distance running in their evolutionary pasts (humans and dogs) exhibited elevated levels of one particular endocannabinoid (anandamide) after running on a treadmill. Ferrets, non-cursorial animals, had no such chemical response and derived no pleasure from it. (Now you might be wondering if you’re part ferret.)\nThis study says it’s actually less about what’sintheir DNA and more about what’sonit.\nA happy dog is a good dog.\nThe behavioral benefits of running may be related more to contentment than fatigue. Perhaps, what we call “tired” is actually better described as “happy,” “relieved of anxiety and pain,” and “experiencing feelings of well-being.” If so, exercise may indirectly benefit dogs’ behavior because itelevates moodrather than simply makes them too worn out to misbehave. Since endocannabinoids lessen the anxiety that can be a source of problem behaviors, it’s easy to see how exercise could help.\nRunning is also associated with the production of other chemicals that reduce anxiety in mammalian brains. Researchersreportedthat mice given the opportunity to run handled stress and anxiety better than sedentary mice. The study observed the brain activity in both groups of mice and found that runners had more excitable neurons in the ventral hippocampus — which plays a role in anxiety — than sedentary mice.\nHow to get your pet to stop chewing on inedibles from clothes to couches.\nThe active mice, however, also had more cells capable of producing the calming chemicals that inhibit activity in that area of the brain, which lessensanxiety. The study supports the idea that for mice, at least, running improves the regulation of anxiety through inhibitory activity in the brain. It is possible that the situation is similar in dogs, though without studying them specifically, we can’t know for sure.\nWhat does this mean for your dog?\nOf course, behavior and physiology, and the links between the two, are never completely straightforward. There is evidence that cannabinoids can cause hyperactivity at low doses, even though they have calming effects at higher doses.\nAge, breed, and individual differences play a role in theamount of exercise requiredto keep your dog’s halo on straight and prevent them from sprouting little horns, behaviorally speaking. Some dogs thrive on small amounts of exercise. For others, the same amount of exercise — perhaps a leash walk at a leisurely pace — has the opposite effect. It invigorates them and may actually induce hyperactivity. For example, for a dog that typically runs 60 to 70 miles a week, switching to shorter exercise sessions for one week (say during a vacation) might actually just amp them up.\nYou — yes you! — can be one of those fun people who runs with your dog. Just be smart about it.\nYour dog will also experience different effects from various amounts and types of exercise (running,hiking,swimming, playingtug, or fetch). When looking at ways to help reduce your dog’s destructive behaviors, you’ll need to find the right balance of training and exercise to help ensure that your pup is content.\nBesides the well-known physical benefits of exercise, its psychological and behavioral benefits are profound. Stopping annoying behaviors and increasing good behaviors make the beautiful relationship between people and dogs that much better. What more could you want for your dog than the highest quality of life, minimal anxiety, the most elevated feelings of contentedness, and the best possible relationship with you?",

  "page_content": "A slobbery tongue to the face can be a jarring way to wake up — even when the cutest pup in the world is on the giving end. This might leave you wondering, “Why does my dog lick me so much?”It turns out that dogs lick humans for all sorts of reasons, beyond just trying to butter you up for treats. One of those reasons is to show affection.\nNevertheless, not all instances of licking should be encouraged; there are also times when licking behavior in dogs might signal discomfort or become a behavioral concern. Let’s explore all the reasons why dogs lick us. We’ll also provide helpful tips forestablishing personal space.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat does it mean when my dog licks me?\nDomesticated dogs have been our besties for ages, but they still retain some of their wild instincts, including licking. Licking is an innate behavior that dogs learn during puppyhood, says Dr. Stefanie Schwartz, a board-certified veterinary behaviorist and founder ofCivilized Pet. It plays an important role in dog-to-dog communication, and it can also give us humans clues about what our dogs need and how they’re feeling.\nSo what does it mean when a dog licks you, and how do you get them to stop when it gets to be too much? We spoke with Dr. Schwartz and other experts to understand this common canine behavior.\nTheir toes might smell like Fritos, but there’s no way they tastethatgood.\nPuppies are lavished with licks from their very first days. It’s how their moms bond with them, nurture and stimulate them. Because “dogs are affectionate and social creatures,” Dr. Schwartz says it’s only natural for adult dogs to express affection for their people in a similar way.\nWhether it’s puppy kisses or a cuddle on the couch, Dr. Schwartz says it’s important to allow those close interactions while maintaining healthy boundaries. In fact, studies have shown that sharing bonding moments between dogs and humans canlower cortisol levels— aka stress levels — in both humans and dogs.\nAnother form of affection, dogs lick their favorite people as a way to groom them, just as they lick and groom each other.. This behavior is calledallogrooming, and it’s a way for dogs to show affection, build trust, and maintain social bonds.\nAcral lick dermatitis is a frustrating skin condition, but new treatments offer hope.\nA dog who is constantly trying to lick you while you’re busy with another task (like reading this article) might feel left out. Licking as a means of attention-seeking is a behavior that can easily become reinforced, cautionsDr. Rachel Malamed, a veterinary behavioral specialist.\nIt’s near impossible to ignore a dog soaking you in slobber (more on how to redirect their behavior below). But if they receive the desired pets, they’ll likely continue licking you — and possibly more frequently.\nMany dogs willexcessively lick themselves, you, or other objects out of boredom. While any pup can become bored without theappropriate amount of exerciseor stimulation, working breeds such as German Shepherds, German Shorthaired Pointers, Golden Retrievers, Great Danes, Irish Setters, Labrador Retrievers, and Pointers are most likely to find other, moredestructive, activitiesto do when they’re understimulated.\nDoes your dog freak out when you head for the door? Here’s some advice.\nDogs lick each other and us to say “Hello!” It’s a greeting observed in ancestral wolves that our dogs still do today, saysJen Gumas, a certified professional dog trainer and founder ofWiggles and Woofs Dog Training & Pet Care.\n“Wolves returning to the group often lick other wolves as a greeting,” Gumas explains. “Sometimes licking theinside of the other wolves’ mouthsto gather information.” That’s why dogs tend to lick your face — or attempt for the mouth. In addition, licking is done by the submissive animal in the dynamic.\nWhile licking is typically a normal behavior, it’s important to recognize when a behavior could signal poor health. If your dog doesn’t just lick your face but islicking odd surfacessuch as floors, walls, carpet, and furniture, they could have a medical condition such as an underlying gastrointestinal issue.\nIf you catch your dog constantly licking surfaces, Dr. Schwartz says compulsive disorders could be at play. Compulsive disorders occur out of context and may become so troublesome that they interfere with your pup’s normal grooming, eating, sleeping, and play activities. Dogs also lick the air when they feel nauseated, Dr. Schwartz adds.\nConsulting behavioral veterinarians like Dr. Malamed and Dr. Schwartz is the recommended route fordiagnosing and treating compulsive disorders in dogs.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nDogs may enjoy licking our salty skin, particularly in areas with lots of sweat glands like our feet. They might also pick up traces of the food we’re eating or aromas from our meals. Other times, Gumas says, they just want to taste us to figure out where we’ve been.\nHow do I know if my dog is licking me out of affection?\nDoes your dog like to lick you as soon as you come home? Cuddle up and lay a wet one on you? What about a puppy kiss as soon as you wake up? Those are all out of affection, Gumas says. Schwartz adds that this is also a submissive greeting. Considering the context of the situation is key to understanding the meaning behind your dog’s slobbery signals.\n“Some dogs tend to lick more when they are nervous,” Gumas says. “Licking can be a way that dogs show another dog that they are not a threat, and sometimes they do this with humans too.”\nThere’s also a theory called “kiss to dismiss.” According to the theory, when uncomfortable with something you’re doing, dogs lick as a polite way to request that you stop doing that. For instance, your pup might lick your hand when trimming their nails.\nDr. Malamed suggests pups licking the air outside of a positive interaction may express conflict, frustration,anxiety, or stress. Either way,paying attention to body language is key. “If a dog is licking you and there are other body language signs that they may be uncomfortable such as a tense body or face, a tucked tail, or a lowered body, it’s best to give your dog some space,” Gumas says.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nAs much as we hate to admit it,  dogs’ mouths (like all animals’ mouths) are abreeding ground for bacteria. For most people, being licked by a dog — even near or on the mouth — isn’t a big deal. However, for those who are immunocompromised or have other health conditions that make them vulnerable to infections, it’s a good idea to discourage licking.\nHow can I prevent my dog from licking me excessively?\nIf you’d rather a pup not lick you — that’s OK! Just be mindful of how you discourage the behavior, our experts say. “Punishment can make a nervous dog even more anxious, which ironically can lead to even more licking,” Gumas says. Instead of reprimanding them for their loving behavior, try one of the following strategies:\nRedirect the licking:Redirect their attention to something else, such as a toy or a game.\nRedirect the licking:Redirect their attention to something else, such as a toy or a game.\nIgnore the licking: If your dog is licking you for attention, try to ignore them.

London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nIf you notice your dog suddenly starts licking excessively, it’s best to consult with your veterinarian. “Repetitive licking can be a sign of numerous conditions ranging from pain to anxiety to allergies,” Gumas says.Gumas emphasizes not punishing dogs for excessive licking. Dogs who tend to lick their humans excessively are often experiencing anxiety, she says. While some people may dislike their dogs licking them and punish them for it, it can totally backfire. Punishment can make an anxious dog even more anxious, which can lead to even more licking.\nDogs lick for a variety of reasons, including affection, grooming, attention-seeking, boredom, stress, and medical conditions. If you’re not comfortable with your dog licking you, there are a few things you can do to discourage the behavior, such as redirecting their attention, ignoring them, or teaching them a “leave it” command. However, it’s important to be patient and consistent with your training, and to avoid punishing your dog, as this can make the problem worse.\nIf your dog’s licking is excessive or if you’re concerned about a medical cause, it's best to consult with your veterinarian.",

    "title": "Why Dogs Burrow Under the Covers (And Dig In the Bed)",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/why-do-dogs-burrow-under-covers"
  },
  "page_content": "If you live with — and let’s be honest, sleep with — certain pups, there is likely the equivalent of a subway system of tunnels underneath the covers of your bed. Well-worn paths that your beloved dog has burrowed through, night after night. What’s the deal with dogs who burrow under the blankets (or dig in bed), and is this behavior safe?\nCertain breeds of dog are more inclined to burrow under the covers or dig in bed, and in general, such denning is not detrimental to their health. But some blanket options are safer than others, and dogs of certain ages and breeds need to be more closely monitored when they hunker down this way. With just a little know-how about dogs’ burrowing behavior, we can rest more easily alongside our comforter-loving pups.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhich Breeds Are Prone To Burrowing?\nIf you cohabitate with a Terrier or Dachshund, you’ve probably witnessed some blanket-digging behavior. These breeds historically were raised to drive vermin out of underground dens, and their ancestors were accustomed to creating and squeezing into tight spaces in order to flush out rodents. Therefore, they instinctively feel comfortable within, say, a dark and cozy duvet.Huskies, too, are apt to burrow under the covers, as their Arctic ancestors dug holes in the snow and nestled in them for insulation (as do current-day sled dogs when on the trail). Though specialists in dog behavior tend to name these three breeds as poster pups for denning, any dog can exhibit blanket-burrowing behavior.\nWhy Do Dogs Burrow?\nAncestors of the domesticated dog settled in tunnels and caves to protect themselves and their young from predators and inclement weather, and today’s canines intuitively seek comfort in spaces they associate with the coziness of a den. Because they’re pack animals, dogs also tend to search for modern-day equivalents of the warmth and sense of security derived from curling up against their littermates. They find these comforts in the act ofsleeping alongside their human “pack members” and nestling beneath blankets that smell soothingly of themselves or their human parents.\nThere are pros and cons of sleeping with your dog — for both of you.\nDogs also burrow as a way to recharge after a day of stressors (you know, how you like to bury under the covers after a bad day at work). “By removing exposure to the sights and sounds of an active household, the dog feels more secure,” says JustAnswer veterinarian Jo Myers, DVM. “After all, it’s your dog’s job to keep an eye on everything going on in and around the house so she can make sure her family is safe,” she says. “When your dog is buried under the blankets in your bed, they can turn off that vigilance and take a break.” Something we can definitely relate to.\nIn addition, being under the covers places a barrier between the pup and any loud noises, such as fireworks or rainstorms. Like a Thundershirt or similar swaddling vest, bedcovers can provide anxiety-reducing pressure to the body of the nervous animal — think of it as their snuggie.\nIs Burrowing Safe For Dogs?\nFor the most part, yes. Healthy adult dogs will thermoregulate — that is, remove themselves from beneath the blankets — when they become too hot. As long as they have an easy exit out of their “dens,” there is little danger in allowing them to dive under the covers. This said, it may be difficult for puppies and smaller breeds to ‘evacuate’ certain types of bedding. In addition, older canines and those with respiratory issues (including flat-faced dogs like Pugs) can have a difficult time breaking free from especially big or heavy blankets. To minimize the opportunity for overheating or entanglement, it’s best to avoid such coverings.\nWhich Blankets Are Potentially Harmful To Burrowers?\nIf your pup can’t get out from underneath a blanket — especially one of those weighted blankets us insomniacs have purchased — it’s not safe. Same goes for a blanket with pockets or openings in which pups could become trapped (duvet covers, for instance). Also, dogs’ teeth or nails can snag in blankets with holes or loose ends, causing them to become stuck in their hidey-holes. “Avoid allowing your dog to burrow in blankets that have become so worn that they’re stringy and look more like a net than a blanket,” warns Dr. Myers. Of course, heated blankets and heating pads — with their electrical cords and quick-warming properties — may also lead to a dangerously sweltering sleep environment and even thermal burns. Experts recommend choosing bed covers made from breathable, hard-to-chew fabrics like fleece, microfiber and mesh.\nCan Burrowing Indicate Anxiety Issues?\nBlanket-burrowing in dogs generally is nothing to sweat about. However, if the digging seems obsessive or is partnered with panting or crying,separation anxietycould be the culprit. You can help release your dog’s tension by providing them with ample exercise and toy stimulation before leaving them on their own. Dog-sitters or a doggy day care also may be useful in minimizing your pup’s attachment issues. This said, if excessive burrowing persists even after the animal’s fear trigger has been identified and removed, the behavior could point to a larger phobia. Ask your vet for recommendations for behavior modification techniques and/or medications based on their assessment of your dog’s compulsive conduct.",

  "page_content": "“Moose doesn’t really play with toys,” his parent said as he dropped the dog off for an afternoon visit. Within an hour, that dog had played with every toy in the house and a couple of items that hethoughtwere toys. He flapped a Wubba around at his own face and did the same with a dishtowel.\nHe went joyfully berserk over a squeaky toy shaped like a bone, fetched tennis balls, and tossed around a fleece fox with a dead squeaker inside. Moose was — no matter what his person said — really into toys. So, what changed?\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThere’s a lot more to it than sniffing each other’s butts.\nBreaks Change Everything\nMoose’s parent was genuinely surprised when told about the afternoon toy playing session. He said it was odd because, at home, all Moose did was follow his other dog, Zach, who loves to play fetch. Moose never got the balls himself. And when Zach was chewing on bones or toys, Moose just watched, no matter how many were lying around. If they specifically gave Moose a toy, Zach would come over to relieve him of it. Moose never objected, so his parent figured that Moose just didn’t have a strong interest in them.\nAu contraire. If you havemore than one dog, there’s a good chance that you’ll see behavioral changes when separating them. That’s because many dogs inmultidog householdsare prevented from doing what comes naturally. If you never observe the dogs on their own, it’s hard to know that they are missing out. In Moose’s case, he was not playing with toys or chewing on bones with Zach around, even though he loves them. (It’s almost a sure bet that a dog who is being “mugged” by another dog who habitually takes the bones and toys would rather maintain possession of them if possible.)\nThe more, the merrier…except when it’s not.\nBenefits of Giving Dogs Time Apart\nEven dogs who adore each other and are truly the best of friends benefit from some time apart. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. There are other ways a dog may benefit from being away from other dogs from time to time:\nSpending time as the only dog allows them to receive undivided attention and morepetting.\nSpending time as the only dog allows them to receive undivided attention and morepetting.\nYoung dogs can get more vigorous exercise sessions than older dogs in their home can tolerate.\nYoung dogs can get more vigorous exercise sessions than older dogs in their home can tolerate.\nDogs who just want the peace and quiet may appreciate the opportunity that a one-dog situation bestows.\nDogs who just want the peace and quiet may appreciate the opportunity that a one-dog situation bestows.\nOther dogs might appreciate the chance to train or play without another dog interrupting the flow.\nOther dogs might appreciate the chance to train or play without another dog interrupting the flow.\nMany people swear that their dogs hate to be apart, but in many cases, the issue is not being apart, but beingleft behind. If more than one person lives in your home, it’s easier to work through this by having each person take one of the dogs to do something at the same time. If you are the only human in the family, then a good plan is to leave something fun andtasty to chew onwith one dog while you go somewhere with the other dog.\n...Without turning your home into a circus.\nIf this is a challenge for your dogs, it’s a good idea to start with very short separations so that you can teach each dog to becomfortable being left alone. It’s a good skill to have in just case one dog becomes ill or injured, and you have a forced separation on your hands.\nFinding Time For Individual Dogs\nThe opportunity to spend quality time as the only dog with their person is so valuable. A little goes a long way, so even the occasional session can be a great treat for a dog and well worth working into even the busiest of schedules.\nIt doesn’t have to be a lot of time; I’m not suggesting you adjust your life so that your dogs have hours of separate activities each day. Even one walk or activity a week, or a couple of separate 15-minute play sessions can go a long way. It only takes a short break to prevent small irritations from building up. Those little stresses may not be obvious to you, but dogs can still get on each other’s nerves. Most dogs adjust and there is no problem, but you can help them enjoy life just a bit more with a change of pace involving time away from each other.",

  "page_content": "People who watch a dog relishing the hedonistic experience of getting a belly rub without their heart melting at least alittleare people you don’t need in your life. OK, that’s a bit unfair because such people may have a perfectly good reason for not reacting like a normal person to the sight of a belly rub.\nAnyway, luckily this unresponsiveness is rare enough that we don’t need to give it much thought. People generally love watching dogs get belly rubs because the dogs are soclearlyloving it.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhy do dogs like belly rubs?\nThe average dog loves a belly rub, though that same dog probably doesn’t like being called “average.” There are many reasons why dogs like belly rubs so much — some physical and some emotional.\nMammals, including dogs, have a sensitive type of neuron that responds to stimulation of their hair follicles, so petting and stroking feel good. The evolutionary basis for a pleasurable feeling related to hair follicles may be that if it feels good to groom (socially or individually) good hygiene and all its benefits will be more likely to occur. The soft hairs on the belly may be especially prone to stimulating the neurons that lead to this pleasurable feeling.\nMammals, including dogs, have a sensitive type of neuron that responds to stimulation of their hair follicles, so petting and stroking feel good.

That’s right, belly rubs allow your dog better living through chemistry!\nAll these factors together mean that belly rubs can help you and your dog bond, strengthen your relationship with each other and make you feel more connected to each other. The comfort and reassurance belly rubs provide our dogs are a result of the effects of this physical contact on their physiology. That’s right, belly rubs allow your dog better living through chemistry!\nYes, belly rubs can be used as a training reward if and onlyifwe are talking about a dog who enjoys them. Belly rubs are not always a great option for training sessions because it is easier to use treats, chews, toys, or a play session when you are doing multiple repetitions of a skill. But, if your dog absolutely adores belly rubs, you can reinforce your dog for doing what you ask in a real-life situation. If your dog does a great “stay,” comes when called, performs a trick, or does something else you really like, a belly rub can be the positive reinforcement you offer  to make it more likely they exhibit that behavior again.\nOffering fewer treats can actually be agoodthing.\nIs there a specific reason dogs expose their bellies?\nThere is more to apparent requests for belly rubs than meets the eye. Just because a dog rolls onto their back does not mean that the dog is asking for a belly rub or even wants one. So, why do dogs present their bellies? It’s a simple question, but like many questions when it comes to dog behavior, there is not a simple answer. We have to make our conclusions based on our observations of dogs and our knowledge of dog behavior.\nIf you want to be a part of the belly rubbing fun, it’s critical to know when a dog likes a belly rub and when they don’t — because not all dogs like them. Even dogs who enjoy belly rubs may not want one all the time, and it’s important to distinguish dogs who are on their back exposing their bellies who want a belly run and those in that position who emphatically do not want a belly rub. To know the difference is all about reading body language, understanding dog behavior and visual signals, and doing your best to understand and communicate with your dog.\nDogs lie on their backs and show their bellies for more than one reason, so if you see a dog lie on their back, that doesn’t mean they are exposing their belly to request that it be rubbed. They may be asking for a belly rub, but it takes some knowledge to know if that’s the reason for their behavior or if there’s another explanation.\nAnd what to do to help them.\nOne other explanation is they are showing their belly as an appeasement signal, which means they are indicating they pose no threat. Dogs who lie on their backs to indicate appeasement tend to be a little tense. They may show signs of stress such as tongue-flicking, a fear grimace, a tucked or tense tail, or avoiding your gaze.\nIf you attempt to give a belly rub to a dog who is presenting their underside as a form of appeasement, they will likely become more tense or  possibly upset because you are touching them in a way they do not want and are not asking for. Lying on their backs in this way is a social signal, not a request for physical contact. It’s an indication that they’re not challenging you and is often behavior you’ll see in a dog who is uncomfortable, socially speaking.\nDogs seeking a belly rub are more likely to be relaxed all over, have a mouth that is open and relaxed with their tongue hanging out, a loosely wagging tail, and are more likely to look at you with squinty eyes. They are likely to relax even more when given a belly rub and may even paw at you for more if you stop.\nCan belly rubs be beneficial for strengthening the human-dog bond?\nAny activity enjoyed together and by mutual consent can be good for the relationship. Petting our dogs, including belly rubs, offers an opportunity for a positive feedback loop of oxytocin and bonding. The more we connect, the more we both produce oxytocin, and the oxytocin makes us feel closer to each other. Petting is practically magical with its power to make us feel closer to each other, to lower our blood pressure, and to release stress. It’s not an exaggeration to say that belly rubs (like other petting of our dogs) is good for our relationship and enhances our quality of life as well as theirs.\nAs individuals, dogs like different types of physical contact, and those variations in preferences apply to belly rubs. The best way to give your dog a belly rub they will enjoy is to pay attention to how they respond to what you are doing and to adjust accordingly. Try either long strokes, circular motions with and without using your nails, or gentle pats for a few seconds. Watch your dog’s response to each of these belly rub styles before taking a little break to see if they walk away or seem to invite more by pawing at you, staying in place or open their posture even wider. If they relax into your motions, sigh, or ask for more when you stop, chances are you are doing something they like.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nAre there any alternatives for dogs who don’t like belly rubs?\nNot all dogs like belly rubs. Perhaps it doesn’t feel good, or maybe they feel too vulnerable to expose their underside. Some may be ticklish, and others may have had a negative experience with a belly rub. Whatever the reason may be, don’t try to rub the belly of a dog who doesn’t want you to, whether it’s your own dog or someone else’s.\nStart slowly and gently and if the dog seems uncomfortable in any way, immediately stop. If your dog prefers to have their chest or their ears be the focus of your attention, then pet them there. If they shy away from any physical contact, respect their feelings and interact in ways they enjoy. It’s simple — if your dog doesn’t like belly rubs, pet them how they like to be pet, and if they don’t like physical contact of any kind, respect that and don’t force them.\nMany dogs love belly rubs, and that’s great for people, because many of us love to give them belly rubs. Dogs look mind-bendingly endearing when they roll over on their backs, mouths flopping around, tails wagging, and generally enjoying themselves. Belly rubs can be a great way to bond with your dog and show them affection — if they like belly rubs, who are we to deprive them of this pleasure in life?",

    "title": "What Are the Effects of Sleeping With Your Dog in Bed?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/effects-sleeping-with-dogs"
  },
  "page_content": "Watching dogs sleep — limbs akimbo, eyebrows twitching, paws paddling in a dreamland chase — is one of the joys of living with them. Another is the coziness of sharing your bed with them. Many people share a bed with their dogs, whether for emotional comfort, warmth (the expression “three-dog night” has real meaning!), or because the bed is their go-to spot. Yet, while it makes people happy, you might wonder if it’s something you should actually be doing.\nOne concern relates to old-school ideas aboutdominance. For many years, people were told that allowing your dogs on the bed with you would interfere with your attempts to dominate them, which was supposedly essential to having a well-trained dog. The entire concept of dominance related to our dogs has been out of favor for many years in the canine world, and rightfully so.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nReputable trainers and behaviorists spend a lot of time in the course of their work explaining to people why this paradigm of dominance is destructive to the relationship, not helpful. And while shame about sleeping with dogs is far less common than it was a decade or two ago, a lot of people still fear being judged on the nighttime canine company they keep. That’s too bad, because many of the effects of sleeping with your dog are so incredibly positive.\nShould you let your dog sleep with you?\nSharing a bed with your dog is a choice, and in so many cases, it’s a darn good choice! There are so many benefits to spending the night together, whether you are next to each other under the cover, or the dog is by your feet. If the benefits are too irresistible to, well, resist, and any downsides are worth tolerating, then the answer to “Should you let your dog sleep with you?” is a solid “Yes!”\nIt’s a personal preference, but here are the pros and cons.\nBenefits to sharing the bed with dogs:\nMost dogs like to sleep with us, whether that means sleeping right next to us, sleeping close to us or even sleeping on top of us. Proximity can also alert us to any problems our dogs may have, such as itchy skin, bad dreams, or general restlessness. The number of people who want to know why dogs like to sleep next to us or why dogs want to sleep on us is far higher than anyone who doesn’t work with dog behavior daily wouldeverguess. It seems to make them feel connected, which is a big benefit to them. A quick way to sum up the effects of sleeping with your dog is that it’s good for your body and good for your soul.\nThe extra security of being close to their people reduces the stress some dogs experience in response to noise, whether it’s simple car sounds or intense. Similarly, many people feel more secure with their dog next to them.\nIn a cold world, it really is nice to have a dog sleeping in the bed. Their body heat makes sleeping cozier and easier when it’s cold out. And hey, the money saved on heating bills can go right toward dog toys and special treats, which makes it a win-win all around.\nPhysical contact makes us feel emotionally closer to our dogs. The oxytocin produced by touching and when we gaze into each other’s eyes produces the same kind of close bond mothers share with their babies. That’s a powerful connection, and building it with your dog is a very special, biological miracle.\nPetting your dog, as you are sure to do when on the bed together, lowers blood pressure and enhances overall health and well-being. The calm state induces relaxation and may allow you to get more rest each night. Better rest, a calmer state, and lower blood pressure are all good for your health, so having your dog sleeping in the bed is just responsible self-care.\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nProblems when dogs share the bed:\nPeople may have very different views on the subject; couples have been known to fight like, well, cats and dogs about it. If you and your partner don’t agree on welcoming a dog to your shared bed, the conflict could harm your relationship. That tension may also affect the relationship between the person who wants a dog-free bed and the dog who senses they are not welcome. Having a dog as a bed buddy can be marvelous if everyone is happy with the arrangement and everyone is sleeping well, but that’s not always the case. If the dog sleeping in your bed is ruining the relationship, that is a major drawback of the practice.\nA dog on the bed may have an impact on the quality of your sleep. A few studies have looked at how having a dog on the bed affects human sleep, with mixed results. A 2017studyinvestigated sleep efficiency (the percentage of time spent in bed actually sleeping) with a dog on the bed and with a dog in the room but not on the bed; the test group was made up of healthy, middle-aged women. The results? “On the bed” had a sleep-efficiency score of 80 percent, while “in the room” clocked in at 83 percent. That’s a small difference, and both figures are considered satisfactory by sleep experts.\nInanother study, more than 40 percent of people who sleep with their dogs reported that their dog did not disrupt their sleep; some said they even improved it. Warmth, contentment and relaxation were cited as sources of these positive co-sleeping evaluations. In the absence of a partner — either because they were single or their partner was away from home — many people said that having their dog on the bed with them gave them a wonderful sense of companionship. Only 20 percent of participants reported that their dogs disrupted their sleep.\nMany people with asthma or allergies report that they suffer more from these conditions if their dog is on the bed with them or even in the same room with them at night. To manage any medical conditions that are exacerbated by being in close proximity to your dog for extended periods, it’s a good idea to consult with your physician and follow their advice. In some cases, there may be steps you can take to minimize the negative effects on your health, whether that involves sleeping with your dog less often, having a little more distance between you and your dog, or direct medical intervention. Following the advice from your doctor is the best way to take care of your health.\nWhile keeping your dog or cat at home where they belong.\nShould I consult my veterinarian before letting my dog sleep with me?\nHealth is too important to take any risks about it, a concept that is relevant to both you and your dog. The link between sleeping with your dog and any possible health concerns for you or your best friend is a subject that requires consultation with medical professionals. Most people have two questions about health and sharing a bed with your dog, and the answers to both are to ask medical professionals.\nIf you wonder, “Should I consult my veterinarian before letting my dog sleep with me?”, my answer is that this is an excellent idea. And the answer to the question, “Can I allow my dog to sleep on my bed if I have certain health conditions?” is similar: Ask your doctor about the wisdom of sleeping with your dog given your particular medical condition.\nThere is no evidence that sleeping with your dog will cause separation anxiety. This myth continues to pop up for predictable reasons. Dogs with separation anxiety are likely to be dogs who want to be as close to you as possible, even at night. So, dogs with separation anxiety are likely to try to sleep in the bed with you. That does not mean that the co-sleeping is thecauseof any separation distress.\nIt’s well known that going to sleep after studying helps people consolidate new information and leads to its storage in long-term memory. In another example of the many parallels between canine and human brains, the same is true for dogs: sleeping is an important part of their learning process, so if being in the bed with you is where they want to sleep and where they sleep best, you are helping them learn and remember.\nIn aHungarian study, researchers taught dogs to respond to the cues “sit” and “lie down” in English, which—because they were trained in a different language—were new to them. After their training session, the dogs napped, and researchers found that during these naps, the dogs exhibited the same sleep-wave patterns associated with sleep-dependent memory consolidation in other species.\nSpecific bursts of brain activity, called sleep spindles, occur during non-REM sleep and are related to learning and memory. Sleep spindle density predicts overnight memory consolidation in people and in rats. According to data from this study, the same is true for dogs. Dogs who had a greater density of sleep spindles following a training session had better recall when tested on their response to the new cues later. Additionally, like female humans, female dogs had more sleep spindles as well as better retention of the new skills when compared to their male counterparts.\nIt’s easy to relate to recent research showing that dogs’ sleep suffers if they have negative experiences during the day—the same thing is true for people. This study compared the sleep of dogs who had a positive experience (being petted or playing an enjoyable game) and those who had a negative experience (being tied to a door and left alone or having a stranger come in and stare at them without saying anything). Dogs who had the negative experiences fell asleep faster, but the quality of their sleep was not as good. They spent less time in deep sleep and more time in REM sleep. If a dog has a bad day, a night of poor sleep is a real possibility, as is the dog’s tiredness and irritability the following day. Sleeping with your dog may help them cope with these challenges, or possibly alert you to their restless sleep so you know they are struggling or perhaps had a bad experience that day.\nIt’s science (and adorable).\nDogs’ Sleeping Positions\nDog sleeping positions are epically weird, and wildly varied. Social media sites are full of posts of dogs sleeping in curious contortions. Some dogs look like they are straight out of a Dali painting as they fold and bend from furniture onto the floor in the oddest ways. Others are upside down, twisted, or sprawled in ways that don’t seem orthopedically possible. Whenever I see a post about dog sleeping positions, there are always many pictures shared of dogs in a position matching the original post, no matter how unusual the posture.\nIf your vet has no concerns about the position in which your dog sleeps, you are one of many people who are dealing with a case of just letting dogs be dogs, no matter how much the way they sleep makes you shake your head. One little-considered effect of sleeping with your dog is the opportunity to experience these postures up close, and that’s the kind of good fun that adds to the joy of sharing your life with dogs.\nDogs love to be near people, people love to be near dogs, and sharing a bed makes most dogs and people feel safe, cozy, loved and warm (at least until the dog steals the covers!) It’s great that there’s been a surge of interest in canine sleep in recent years. Paying attention to your dog’s sleep can influence your relationship with them, their quality of life and their happiness. Yes, sleep is that important.\nReferences\nSleep macrostructure is modulated by positive and negative social experience in adult pet dogs\nSleep macrostructure is modulated by positive and negative social experience in adult pet dogs\nThe interrelated effect of sleep and learning in dogs (Canis familiaris); an EEG and behavioural study\nThe interrelated effect of sleep and learning in dogs (Canis familiaris); an EEG and behavioural study\nZoonotic Risks of Sleeping with Pets\nZoonotic Risks of Sleeping with Pets\nThe curious incident of the dog in the nighttime: The effects of\nThe curious incident of the dog in the nighttime: The effects of",

  "page_content": "Your pup is your best friend, and they’s follow you anywhere — even, sometimes, into the bathroom (OK, a little too much love). And they want to make you happy. This doesn’t mean that’sallthey want in life, though. People like to think that their dogs have naturally evolved into being little people-pleasers, but like all living creatures, they have their own desires and agendas. This misunderstanding is pretty common, and it really affects how dog parents approach training and getting to know their dogs.\nFor example, a nervous dog who can’t face strangers, dog parks, traffic won’t get over those things just to make you happy. A positive-reinforcement dog trainer might approach your dog’s anxiety by giving them treats every time they’re around a trigger, distracting them from the problem, and making it a fun moment instead. Car drives by? Treat! Strangers approach? Treat! Twenty preschoolers holding hands skipping by? Treat! Treat! Treat!\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThere will always be Debbie Downers who contradict this process by saying, “You’re spoiling her,” or “My dog sits because he wants to please us. You should make your dog respect you.” Or “You’re bribing her.”\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nIs this really a valid way to see dogs’ motivations? Are dogs born with a desire to please? And why, if thousands and thousands of animals — chickens, goats, sea lions ,and parrots and so on — have been professionally trained using food as motivation, is there such a stigma about using food to train dogs? Here’s what professional dog trainers and dog psychologists say about the canine disposition.\nDoes domestication make a dog behave?\nThere’s no scientific research to prove this either way. Dog cognition is a growing area of study today, so down the road, we might have a better sense of what exactly is going on inside our dogs’ little noggins. As of now, we don’t have any real idea.\n“I would accept the fact that because of the close relationship that dogs have had with humans for so long, they maybe do have this predisposition to want to please,” says Marc Bekoff, author and professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Colorado, Boulder. “But then when you consider that around 75 percent of all dogs on the planet are feral…I’ve met lots of feral dogs who don’t really care about me. They want to avoid me more than anything.”\nOffering fewer treats can actually be agoodthing.\nAre you making up what your dog is thinking?\nThere is a tendency in most dog parents to anthropomorphize their pets, which can lead to a lot of misunderstanding. Just as they do with other humans, people have a tendency to ascribe motives that don’t necessarily exist to their dogs.\n“[People] project all sorts of things on all sorts of social relationships, ranging from dogs to other humans,” Bekoff says. “You go to dog parks and [you’ll hear] dogs characterized in one way: playful, standoffish, maybe a little aggressive. It’s incredible how different people watch the same dog and have a completely different personality profile for the dog.”\nDo dogs experience guilt or remorse?\nAlexandra Horowitz is a professor of psychology and canine cognition at Barnard College at Columbia University, and she led a study in 2009 to test this. She wanted to see if people who claimed their dogs were showing that well-known “guilty look” when they came home to a torn-up couch or a pile of poo on the antique rug were actually reading the dog correctly.\nIn the experiment, participants told their dogs not to eat a treat the pup wanted and then left the room. When they returned, the researchers would tell the dog’s parent whether or not the dog ate the treat. But the researchers were not always truthful. In some cases, the dog would leave the treat alone but the parent would be told that they ate it, or vice versa. Thus, sometimes dogs who did what they were told were scolded and others who disobeyed by eating the treat were not.\nThis body language is not as simple as you probably think.\nIt turns out that the behavior dog parents were sure represented guilt — some combination of avoiding eye contact, rolling over, tail tucking, tongue flicking, pressing their ears back and/or skulking away — was tied to the parent’s tone of voice and demeanor. The look, therefore, more likely represented the dog’s anticipation of punishment or attempting to evade it than feeling guilt.\nWhy is it a problem to assign feelings to dogs?\nThinking your dog understands and feels about situations in the same way you do is actually bad for the dog.\n“This misattribution could be harmful to dogs if their owners have expectations that the dogs do understand rules, correct behavior, and so forth, and believe that dogs either willfully or neglectfully violate these rules,” Horowitz and Julie Hecht write in a chapter they co-authored for the bookDomestic Dog Cognition and Behavior: The Scientific Study of Canis familiaris.\nJean Donaldson, founder of theAcademy for Dog Trainers, has been the voice of opposition to the “desire to please” notion for more than two decades for just this reason. “Trainers who make claims about dogs working ‘to please’ or strictly for praise,” she writes in her bookCulture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way of Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs.“Seems oblivious to the main motivator they employ: pain.”\nTime to whip outThe Notebookfor a little doggie movie night.\nRather than being given food or toys or something else they really love to reinforce good behavior, dogs are punished for bad behavior.\n“We expect dogs to do things without reward, that they should know that sitting is what I want them to do, or they should know this or that,” says Jill Sackman, veterinary behaviorist and member of theAmerican Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior. “I don’t think we [reward] enough with human beings either. We live in a culture where it’s like, ‘I’m gonna point out your negative’ instead of capturing you doing something really great and continuing to reward that.”\nWhat are some of the worst training techniques to come out of this POV?\nTwenty years after the first publication ofCulture Clash, there is still evidence of trainers using pain to punish dogs for being “disobedient” rather than teaching them what to do and reinforcing that behavior.\nNicky Wilke turned to trainers last year for help with her 90-pound Husky mix, Charlie, who would pull her to the ground when he darted after another dog. Wilke was horrified by the methods they recommended. She was expressly told by multiple trainers not to use food because Charlie would only behave for the “bribe” and not because he respected her.\n“Everyone was telling me I had to be more firm with Charlie,” Wilke says.\nLook behind the advertising language when picking a dog trainer.\nAnd by “be more firm,” they meant that she should use some incredibly cruel techniques to punish Charlie when he didn’t do what they wanted: shock him with electricity from a collar around his neck. Wrap his leash around his belly near his genital area so that it would rub when he pulled. Squeeze a pressure point right above his back leg if he reacted to another dog.\n“If we say something really clear like ‘come’ or ‘sit,’ and on occasion we witness the dog not doing it, it’s almost impossible for people to interpret anything other than, ‘He knows what to do, I’ve seen him do it, and now that he’s not doing it, it’s because of some sort of power struggle,’” Donaldson says in a phone interview. “And as soon as you get into ‘power struggle,’ then we’re down the rabbit hole.”\nWhat are some alternative approaches to support a dog's real nature?\nWilke persevered and found Renée Erdman, a positive-reinforcement trainer and graduate of theAcademy for Dog Trainers. Erdman has helped Wilke teach Charlie how to walk politely on leash and how to behave around other dogs.\n“She saved our lives,” Wilke says. “I used to have anxiety taking Charlie out for a walk. I went from not being able to walk past a dog to introducing Charlie to dog parks and playing with seven dogs at the same time.”\nErdman’s magic trick? Food.\n“Once I started getting into different treats — really tasty treats — it was like, okay, now he’s paying attention to me. Now he’s interested in playing the games and learning,” Wilke says. “It was an amazing feeling to finally have control of the situation, and I feel more connected and bonded to my animal because he’s actually looking to me. He’s wanting to learn.”\nYou may continue to be questioned or judged for using food as a reward with your dog when they don’t eat dog poop after you tell them “leave it.” Remember, though, your dog is not working you for food. They don‘t love you any less because they know they’ll get a jackpot of treats. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. You’re just creating positive associations of being with and listening to you.\n“I think that to play that dichotomy of food versus true love is ridiculous,” Bekoff adds. “It’s just not supported by any research at all.”",

  "page_content": "OK, here’s one all dog parents will know. Even if you have a puppy, and you’ve been their parent for just a few days, you’ve probably already seen them scent mark. This is when your dog releases a small amount of urine, usually in multiple locations. Marking is a common dog behavior, but if your pup does it often, you might be wondering if that’s normal.\nTurns out, lots of dogs do it frequently, but small dogs are most likely to pee often and to scent mark a lot, too. Here’s everything you need to know about the urinary habits of small dogs.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhat is Scent Marking?\nScent marking is a common form of communication across a wide range of animals. Although dogs can scent mark in various ways, they most often use urine, which is obvious to anyone who has watched dogs pee here, there, and effingeverywherewhile out on a walk.\nTips you’ll want to pay attention to.\nUrination, and other forms of scent marking, allow animals to convey a large amount of information in an indirect manner. In other words, when they mark, they can communicate without direct interactions, which is a good thing because it helps them avoidstress, the energetic costs of interacting, and potential injury. In many species, body size is closely correlated with competitive ability, which is why scent marking may be especially important to smaller animals, who may be unlikely to fare well in direct encounters.\nDo Small Dogs Pee More Frequently?\nDogs have an enormous size range for a single species, but only in the past several years has the effect of size on frequency of scent marking been investigated. Researchers wondered whether smaller dogs take advantage of the indirect nature of scent marking through urine to be more competitive with larger dogs.\nResearch on shelter dogs found that smaller dogs pee more often than larger dogs do, and males pee more often than females. Additionally, smaller dogs, males, and dogs who have been at the shelter longer all directed their urine at targets more often, meaning they were scent marking rather than just peeing because they had to go.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nThe authors of a2016 studyconcluded that smaller dogs use scent marking in the form of urination more frequently than larger dogs. Yes, small dogs pee more often, as most anyone who has lived with both small and large dogs is likely to have noticed, and there are multiple reasons for that.\nIt’s natural to assume that the small-dog bladder situation at least partially explains why little dogs pee more often, and that assumption is correct. Small dogs can’t store as much urine, so they need to relieve themselves more frequently.\nIt’s natural to assume that the small-dog bladder situation at least partially explains why little dogs pee more often, and that assumption is correct.

Young dogs usually have to pee more frequently than adult dogs.\nIf the smaller dog is little because they are not yet full grown, their age is another factor. Young dogs usually have to pee more frequently than adult dogs.\nCan I help manage my small dog’s urination schedule?\nSome dogs, especially small ones, just can’t hold their pee for as long as we’d like. It can be inconvenient, but remember that your dog can’t help it — when you’ve got to go, you’ve got to go. Every dog has an upper limit of how long they can go from one pee to the next, and it’s reasonable to guess they feel pretty uncomfortable if they are always pushed to the edge of that limit.\nAnd why you shouldn’t skip the longer routes.\nIt’s much kinder to allow them the opportunity to pee more frequently than they absolutely need to. To manage their urination schedule, keep a regular routine of trips outside to pee, and gradually increase the time between outings, but never make it so long your dog can’t hold it or acts desperate to pee.\nThere is a lot of variation in how often dogs need to go, just like with people, as anyone who has ever gone on a road trip with a group of friends knows. At the absolute minimum, a dog needs to pee three to four times a day, but many dogs need to go far more frequently. A typical dog needs to go five or six times each day, but up to eight  times is far from unusual, and many dogs benefit from an extra chance to go after each meal.\nAs puppies, a general rule is that, at best, they can hold it for no more than their age in months plus one hour, so a four-month old puppy may be able to make it for five hours. That’s only true if they don’t drink a whole bunch of water right at the start of that time period, and they are not playing hard, eating, or chewing on something, all of which can make them more likely to need to go potty. So, this rule means that a tired puppy at rest can make it that long.\nDo these things to help your pup (and your guests) feel chill.\nGenerally, dogs can hold their pee for six to eight hours once adults, but most will naturally pee every four to six hours throughout the day. Most adult dogs can make it eight or nine hours at night without having to go out to relieve themselves, but not all dogs can go that long during the day when they are awake and more active. Senior dogs usually need to go more frequently as they push further and further into their golden years.\nMedications and diets are factors that can influence the frequency of urination of dogs of any size. In fact, some medications increase the frequency of urination. Any concerns about diet and medication related to your specific dog’s urination frequency should be discussed with your veterinarian.\nFrequency of urination is highly individual, so it’s different for each dog. But small dogs (and puppies and senior dogs, too) generally pee more frequently than larger dogs. Their small dog bladders are one reason for this, but a higher metabolism and their tendency to mark more frequently than big dogs are factors, too. Because having a small dog means they need to go out more often, it seems that being a parent to one is the perfect excuse to leave work as soon as possible to get home to them. As if you needed a reason!\nHow to cope with dog anxiety—from training to medication.\nFAQs (People Also Ask):\nIt’s common for little dogs to pee at least five times a day and as many as eight times daily is not unusual.\nYes, small dogs need to pee more often than larger dogs do, and they also mark more often than larger dogs.\nSmaller dogs often take longer to potty train. They can’t hold it as long, so they are more likely to have accidents.\nKeep a regular schedule of trips outside to pee, and gradually increase the time between outings, but not so much that your dog can’t hold it, or seems at all desperate to relieve themselves.\nThe important factors are their small dog bladder, their higher metabolism, their tendency to scent mark more often, and sometimes their age.\nThis is a question to discuss with your veterinarian.\nReferences\nPreliminary assessment of differences in completeness of house-training between dogs based on size\nPreliminary assessment of differences in completeness of house-training between dogs based on size\nHow Often Do Dogs Need To Pee — Small Breed Edition\nHow Often Do Dogs Need To Pee — Small Breed Edition\nHow Often Should a Dog Urinate?\nHow Often Should a Dog Urinate?\nWhy Do Small Dogs Urinate More Frequently Than Large Dogs?\nWhy Do Small Dogs Urinate More Frequently Than Large Dogs?\nWhy Is My Puppy Peeing So Much?\nWhy Is My Puppy Peeing So Much?\nWhy Does Your Dog Pee So Much?

  "page_content": "Dogs don’t socialize the same way that humans do, and so they might not enjoy receiving kisses from humans. Only kiss your dog if they appear to enjoy the attention, and learn how to read their behavioral cues and responses.\nDo dogs like receiving kisses?\n“Human signs of affection likehuggingand kissing are not how dogs show affection,” Ferdie Yau, the director of shelter and community outreach for Behavior Vets explains over email. It’s impossible to know what dogs are truly thinking, of course, Yau says. But whether they understand hugs and kisses or not, they might put up with it for our sake.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\n“I do think many dogs tolerate it for their humans,” Yau says. “Some might even enjoy it for brief moments, but the majority of dogs do not show that they enjoy hugs.” If hugging and kissing are human forms of affection, dogs show their affection with loose bodies, rubbing themselves against you. Yau says they may nuzzle your hand to solicit petting and cuddles, too.\nThey may also shower you in their own, sloppy kisses, of course. While dog kisses are different from ours, their urge to lick is instinctual. “Right from birth that is how the mother communicates with her new puppies,” dog trainer Victoria Stilwell explains to theCentral Texas Veterinary Specialty and Emergency Hospital. Licking can also be a way of maintaining pack harmony, she says, with more submissive dogs licking more dominant ones as a show of submission.\nLearn how to read a dog’s responses.\nAs behaviorist and trainer Karen B. Londonwrote for Kinship, kisses and hugs may cause dogs to feel more stressed than loved. Putting your face close to a dog’s can be seen as threatening to them, and hugging does not come naturally to pups. Head pats and holding their paws can also be unpleasant for them, London notes.\nThanks, they hate it.\nKnowing how to read dog behavior is key to keeping your pup safe and happy. Too often, Yau says, we project our own thoughts and feelings onto our canine companions, instead of letting them be the animals they are. “These days, many people have unreasonable expectations about how dogs should behave because they tend to treat them as furry humans, rather than biological dogs who are most closely related to wild canids like wolves and coyotes,” Yau says.It’s important for humans to be able to identify and respect their stress signals so that they don’t unwittingly cause their dog distress when they’re trying to show them love. If you are kissing your dog, and they become rigid, flick their tongues, orpull their ears back, those are likely signs that they are feeling uncomfortable, and you should back off.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nLet your dog decide whethertheywant more kisses and cuddles.\nHow can you tell if your dog is enjoying your show of affection or simply humoring you? Yau suggestsconsent test petting. Pet your dog for a few seconds on an area of their body where they like to be touched, then stop, hold your hands out, and see how they respond. “If your dog moves closer or nudges your hand, that’s a sign they want petting interaction to continue,” Yau says. “If they seem indifferent or walk away from you, that’s a sign that the dog does not want to be pet in that moment.” This exercise allows your dog to decide how much cuddling they’re comfortable with, instead of us forcing our human forms of affection onto them.\nSo, do dogs like kisses? Maybe some dogs do,sometimes. Keep an eye on how your dog responds to you when you shower them with human forms of affection, and let them decide whether they want more or less of it. I’ve been trying to not overwhelm my dog with hugs and kisses as much, though it takes all of my willpower to do so. Instead, I’ve beensinging her more songsabout how cute and sweet she is. There’s no expert research on whether that’s better or worse than kissing her, so I guess I’ll keep it up.",

    "title": "Noise Sensitivity and Pain in Dogs",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/noise-sensitivity-and-pain-dogs"
  },
  "page_content": "Turns out, your dog’s fear of fireworks and other loud sounds might also be related to the fact that their noise sensitivity is actually painful for them. A 2018studyabout noise sensitivities in dogs gives us information that could improve the quality of life and well-being of a lot of dogs. The research suggests that pain can be a cause of new noise sensitivities, especially in older dogs.\nSigns of Noise Sensitivity in Dogs\nSome common signs of a dog’s sensitivity include cringing, trembling or retreating, but pet parents may be less able to identify signs of fear or anxiety when behaviors are more subtle. For example, dogs could pant, lick their lips, turn their head away or even stiffen their body. Sometimes their ears will turn back, and their head will lower below their shoulders. “We know that there are a lot of dogs that have noise sensitivities, but we underestimate their fearfulness to noise we consider normal because many dog owners can’t read body language,” says Emma Grigg, a research associate and lecturer at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n“Dogs use body language much more than vocalizing and we need to be aware of that,” said Grigg. “We feed them, house them, love them and we have a caretaker obligation to respond better to their anxiety.”\nAnd what to do to help them.\nResearching Noise Sensitivity in Dogs\nThe study compares two groups of dogs who both had sound sensitivities of various kinds. Dogs in the study all had fearful responses to sounds such as cars, planes, gunshots, motorcycles, fireworks, or thunderstorms. One group of dogs had also been diagnosed with a pain condition, while the other group contained dogs who were apparently free of such pain. (It’s hard to know for sure that a dog is pain-free, but these dogs had been evaluated and not found to be in pain.)\nThe two groups of dogs were generally similar in age, spay/neuter status, and temperament and did not vary substantially by breed. All were referred by other veterinarians to the specialty clinic where the research was conducted.\nThere were some really interesting differences between the two groups of dogs:\nThe dogs in pain had a later onset (nearly four years) of reactivity to noise.\nThe dogs in pain had a later onset (nearly four years) of reactivity to noise.\nTips for treating achy joints — from medications to massages.\nNoise Sensitivity and Pain in Older Dogs\nResearchers hypothesize that a dog startling in response to loud sounds may exacerbate pain. The resulting muscle tension or sudden movement may aggravate tender areas of the body, therefore creating an association between loud noises and pain, which could lead to the development of a fear of such sounds. They reasonably assume that pain is more likely to develop as dogs age.\nIt has long been known that when older dogs suddenly become aggressive, especially to other dogs, that pain may be the cause. Chasing, wrestling, and other behaviors common during play can increase pain in a dog with an injury or other physical issue, causing the dog to avoid such behavior and react negatively to dogs attempting to initiate play.\nIn the early years of my work with dogs with serious behavioral issues, I observed that many older dogs became thunderstorm-phobic or developed noise sensitivities that seemed out of character, and I wished that I knew why. I wondered if changes in the amygdala or other parts of the brain associated with fear could be a factor. The idea that pain can play a role in developing new fears makes sense, and that is more likely to happen to older dogs because they are more likely to have physical issues that cause pain. We have long known that the sudden onset of aggression and other behavioral issues is often a clue that pain is a factor, especially in older dogs.\nAs dogs age, it’s important to recognize both physical and mental changes they may be experiencing.\nTreating the Source\nAll of the dogs who were in pain except one improved substantially with treatment, confirming the researchers’ assertions that prognosis is excellent once the role of pain is identified and the case managed accordingly. (The pet parent of the one dog who did not improve chose not to use analgesics to alleviate the dog’s pain.) Once the pain is managed, it is still often necessary to use behavioral techniques to help dogs overcome the learned associations with loud noises.\nThe recommendations based on the work are:\nOlder dogs who become noise sensitive should be routinely assessed for pain\nOlder dogs who become noise sensitive should be routinely assessed for pain\nAnalgesics or other pain management strategies should be considered.\nAnalgesics or other pain management strategies should be considered.\nDIY ways to help your pup cope with the pain.\nHopefully, the insights in this work will encourage practitioners to explore pain as a possible culprit in older dogs who develop a fear of loud noises. The more we understand dog behavior — dogs in general as well as each dog as an individual — the better we can care for these wonderful creatures who share our lives and our hearts.",

    "title": "Playing Tug With Your Dog Is Good Exercise For Both Of You",

  },
  "page_content": "There’s a lot of information floating around the Internet about what games you play with your dog that make them quietly go insane. Rest assured, there’s one game you can still play with your pup that will only makeyouinsane — tug!\nCanine behavior experts have given the game theirseal of approval, though there are caveats. Dogs who like it — which is most of them — get a lot from it; even some who don’t take to it immediately can learn to enjoy it. One of the beautiful things about this game is that for most dogs, nobody has to teach them how to do it. Even puppies still adorably tripping over their own feet play tug games. It’s that natural for them.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nBut it’s uncommon to meet dogs with a casual interest in the game — dogs tend to eitherloveto play tug or have little interest in it all. Here are the ins and outs of the game for new pet parents or for seasoned pet parents who have never known there was anything more to know than “pull.”\nWhy Do Dogs Like Tug of War?\nFor the ones who adore it, tug offers a way to engage them in play,exercisethem, teach them skills they need to play safely so it’s fun for people and dogs alike, and reinforce them with something valuable.\nAnd for a game you can play in a relatively small space, it’s remarkably tiring for your dog. The high-intensity nature of tug relaxes a lot of dogs, improving their emotional state and leaving them calm and contented after a good session.\nYou can play tug with dogsindoors— great news when it’s stifling hot,pouring rainor too cold to enjoy being outside for long. Playing outdoors is wonderful, too, but it’s nice to have an indoor option. Tug is an easy game, it requires no great skill to play. Simplicity is always a gift, and tug offers it.\nHow to Play Tug-of-War With Your Dog\nThough training isn’t necessary for most dogs to enjoy this natural andfun game, some need a little encouragement to join in. Some timid dogs show a bit of hesitancy about pulling on an object when a person picks it up or has it in hand. To get such dogs fully on board with tug, it helps to signal to your dog that you want to play.\nOffer a modifiedplay bowby bending your knees and leaning over at the waist, then wave a long toy on the ground to get their attention. For dogs who aren’t naturals at tug, putting a toy on the ground and then moving it around or waving it back and forth will get the game going. Many dogs who are tug converts learned to play it this way.\nIt doesn’t have to be a battle.\nCalmly praise them for approaching the toy and for taking hold of it. Keep that gentle praise coming as they grab the toy, then pull back gently. For a dog who’s a bit unsure, it’s important that you refrain from pulling hard or waving the toy frantically. Keep things nice and easy. Be chill.\nIf your dog will grab the toy but won’t pull on it, use only the tiniest bit of pressure when you pull the toy to make it more likely that they will hang on to it. Once they’re regularly and reliably holding on, gradually increase the force you use to pull. Before long, they’re likely to match your effort. And voilà — a game of tug will be in session.\nWhat about tug-of-war with a teething puppy?\nTug can be fun, but playing with a dog who gradually moves their mouth up the tug toy toward your hand can suck the joy out of the game really fast. Safety is always the primary goal, so if your dog is a creeper, it’s a good idea to make some adjustments to protect your delicate human hand from the teeth and powerful jaws of yourdog’s mouth.\nThere are two ways to do this. One is to use a really long toy, which requires your dog to move quite a way up the toy before the situation becomes troublesome. A second is to grab the end of the toy they originally had and reset the game; in this case, you’ll be holding the end opposite from where you started.\nHow do you do this? As they approach your end of the toy, drop it and reach for the end of their side. This takes coordination, speed and practice, but quickly becomes quite natural. There may be a few collisions during the learning process, so be careful.\nIf neither of those methods are enough to manage the issue, entice them with a second tug toy, then switch between the two as needed. Or, finally, end the game when their mouth starts to travel along the toy toward you. Many dogs are more likely to stick to their end of the toy once they figure out that doing otherwise hastens the end of the game.\nIs Tug of War Bad for Dogs?\nYears ago, playing tug was not considered a great idea with dogs. There were concerns about allowing the dogs to use the full force of their mouths around people’s hands and about tug leading toover-arousal. Many also feared that allowing dogs to “win” by ending up with the toy would lead to trouble in the form of dogs throwing their weight around because they had succeeded in tug. Knowledge and beliefs are constantly changing, and now, the benefits of tug are more universally recognized.\nChase? Wrestle? Tug-o-war? Find out which are fair game.\nHowever,research by Rooney and Bradshawreported in 2002 suggests that allowing a certain type of dog to keep the toy after a game of tug can create a different issue. In their study, they observed that the mostplayful dogsbecame pushier for attention from their owners if they were allowed to keep the toy after tug games.\nThis is easy to avoid. If your dog is really persistent and likely to pester you to play, simply put the toy out of reach when the tug game is over.\nSome dogs never tire of tug and are willing to play until their person is ready to stop. Other dogs lose interest quickly even though their people want to keep playing. If your dog is one of the latter, making the game more exciting will help keep them interested.\nHow to Make Playing Tug More Interesting For Your Dog\nUse the toy your dog is most interested in. For many dogs, the top-level toy is a really thick rope, two inches or so in diameter and at least two feet long, sometimes with a knot tied in each end to make it more grippable.\nPlay at the time of day during which your dog is the most energetic. For a lot of dogs, the best time to play tug is mid-morning or late afternoon, times when a majority of dogs are filled with energy and likely to be the most playful. If you’re not sure when your dog is most revved up, experiment with play at different times of day to figure out if it makes a difference in how long her interest lasts.\nSome dogs find it more exciting to play tug if you pull the toy in a haphazard fashion rather than smoothly, and/or if you pull upward rather than straight and parallel to the ground. To keep from injuring either yourself or your dog, avoid pulling too jerkily or too high.\nIf your dog also enjoysfetch, combine tug with a retrieve. Throw the toy, and when your dog brings it back, reinforce with a game of tug. Don’t tug too long, though; before they lose interest, throw the toy again. Vary the fetch/tug ratio: Go from 1:1 to 1:3 or 1:4. Unpredictably mixing the two games keeps many dogs interested and willing to play longer.\nCan a Dog Be Trained to Like Tug\nIf calmly pulling a toy along the ground doesn’t work, there’s another way to help a dog find their tug groove: Teach it as you would teach any other trick — such as “shake,” “roll over “or “wave good-bye” — through shaping, which is reinforcing successive approximations of the behavior you want to eventually achieve.\nWith tug, that means begin byreinforcingyour dog for showing any interest in the toy, whether looking at it, approaching it, or poking at it with their paw or nose. Over time, raise your criteria so your dog has to do more to earn the treats. The series of steps may be touching the toy, remaining in physical contact with it a beat longer, mouthing it and grabbing it.\nIt actually has a lot to do with genetics.\nEventually, offer your dog treats for pulling on the toy while you hold the other end, gradually requiring them to pull harder or longer to earn the reinforcement. Some dogs will only ever play tug in this kind of mechanical way, but others come to love it and begin to play the game just for the fun of it.\nHow to Keep a Dog From Becoming Overexcited Playing Tug\nThough it takes effort to get some dogs get excited enough about tug to play, there are also dogs on the opposite end of the spectrum, ones who struggle with emotional control during tug. These dogs can get nippy, leap up on people or even pull them over. Such out-of-control behavior is generally all about arousal, and that must be addressed in order for tug to be fun for both of you.\nDogs need to develop and practice self-control to be able to play appropriately, and it’s easier for them to do that if we work on lowering their arousal level. Generally, the best advice is not to add to the arousal, and to do everything you can to control it.\nChoose the tug toy carefully. Use one that doesn’t get the dog too revved up. Choose the time of day. Many dogs are naturally calmest in the middle of the day or after a long walk or run, and those might be the best times to play tug with a dog who is easily amped up during the game.\nTake frequent breaks of 5 to 15 seconds to interrupt the upward spiral of enthusiasm. When you play, pull the toy in a slow, steady way, low and parallel to the ground rather than upward in a jerky or unpredictable way.\nHow to Help a Dog Accept the End of the Game\nSome dogs aretooenthusiastic about tug, and don’t take it well when the game ends. One of the best ways to handle this is to teach your dog that when you say “all done,” you will only tug for a few seconds more.\nCommunicating intent to end the game helps many dogs cope because they are not caught off guard. It’s tough for dogs who want to play tug endlessly to have it end without any warning.\nAnother way to ease the pain of ending the game is to follow it with something else your dog likes — atraining session, awalk, amassage— so that they associate the end of a tug game with feeling happy.\nHere’s the takeaway: Tug is fun and makes many dogs so happy. Let the games begin!",

Those ear scratches can make you a dog’s best friend forever — and sometimes they won’t ever let you stop (not that you’re complaining).\nWe’ve convinced ourselves that all dogs want to be pet. They love it. And it’s good for them, too. So, we reach out a little too greedily, eager for the validation of that unconditional return of affection. Unfortunately, we have it all wrong, saysanimal behaviorist William Berloni, who trains shelter dogs to perform on Broadway, on TV, and in movies. So, what’s the proper way to pet a dog, especially one you’ve never met before? Read on to find out.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHow to Pet a Dog You’ve Never Met\nSome dogs wantall the pets. Others endure strangers’ clumsy overtures with grace. But quite a few land somewhere in between annoyed and totally freaked out. So why do dogs, who are perfectly capable of sinking their teeth into our skin, put up with us? “Because they are better creatures than we are,” Berloni says. “We’d slap or kick or file a lawsuit [if a stranger touched us] — we wouldn’t be as forgiving!”\nFeeling a little defensive — especially when I remember how many times I’ve been told that dogs don’t like to be pet on the head and have done it anyway — I ask how he greets a dog for the first time. “I look at the dog, smile, and say: ‘Hi, how are you?’ If the dog approaches, I’ll put my hand out, and if they solicit with more than a sniff, I’ll give it to them,” he says. “But it’s all based on their cue. Some dogs, like Terriers, like to check you out for a while. Hunting dogs will sniff; they might not want to be pet, but they’ll put up with it while they sniff you.”\nStep one: Never put your face close to theirs.\nWhat about dogs who come bounding up, eager to interact? “That’s like someone extending a hand,” Berloni says. “It’s the beginning of creating a relationship, but it has nothing to do with touching them. If you watch dogs interact, they’re reacting to each other’s signals: sniff, approach, play, attack...I grew up on a farm. My pets were my companions so I learned how to play their games so they would hang out with me.”\nTrainer Marilyn Pona did the same, coaxing a surly neighborhood Chow Chow into friendship. “If you really look at dogs, unless they’re having a moment of play, they don’t touch each other,” she says. “It’s something we can offer them that they don’t have in their world. And it does please them.” Just not always, automatically, across the board.\nFiguring out how to interact with a dog you’ve never met before isn’t that hard when you take a step back, Berloni says. “When I meet a stranger, I don’t grab them. And when I’m going to kiss somebody, I don’t grab them around the neck with two hands.” That’s one of his pet peeves when it comes to petting a dog: “People take two hands, scrunch the dog’s neck, scratch their ears, thinking that is enjoyable to them. It’s too much! It’s like your aunt pinching your cheeks.”\nIf your dog’s tail is wagging“to the left, to the left,”asBeyoncésays, it could mean they’re anxious.\nWhen Berloni trains a dog for someone to work with, he’ll say, “OK, now you have to bond with them.” And what do they do? “They go down on their knees and rub the dog all over, which makes the dog get silly. When we’re very vigorous with them, that’s an invitation to play, and it’s not relaxing at all. If you want to soothe a dog, [think about] what a mama dog does. She licks her puppies, gently and calmly, and she goes with the grain of the fur.”\nHow to Read a Dog’s Cues\nRandy Grim, founder ofStray Rescue of St. Louisand author ofDon’t Dump the Dog, winces every time he hears someone say breezily, “All dogs love me,” or “You just have to look at the expression on their face.”You’re gonna get bit, he’s thinking. “Leave reading a dog’s face to the experts. That takes a special knack,” he says. “I’m good at it because I’ve been around them forever. But it’s hard. If [a dog is] panting, people can mistake it for a smile when it’s reallyanxiety. That crinkled-face look can be curiosity, notaggression.” Read their body, not their face, he suggests. Does the dog seem approachable, maybe panting but with the tail wagging, the hackles down, the butt wiggling?\n“A lot of dogs are hand-shy because they’ve been over-touched,” Pona notes. “Fingertip touching, I think, is best. And look at your dog when you’re touching them. It’s just the two of you communicating — not you petting them frantically while you talk to somebody else because the petting helps you focus your thoughts or forget your shyness.”\nHow to teach your pup to play nice.\nShe cracks up when she sees someone being interviewed on television on one of those “Pet of the Week” spots. “They’re nervous and petting the dog more and more, and the dog is completely ambivalent. It’s almost like the dog’s saying,If you need to do that, go ahead. It’s an act of generosity, one more grace note in the cross-species relationship.\nHow to Pet Your Own Dog\nWhat about your own dog? How can you tell if you’re over-petting or petting in a way that’s unwelcome? “If your dog comes in close and wants to be touched, and when you stop petting, paws you or ducks their head under your hand and actually solicits your touch, you know they’re enjoying it,” Pona says. “If they’re not doing that, then maybe they don’t need it; they just need to be next to you. Where does your dog go when everybody else is relaxing? That will tell you a lot. Do they lie down next to you or bounce up on the sofa for petting?”\nThere are a few ways you can tell if your touch is stressing your dog out. According to Grim, “The most obvious way a dog saysdon’tis agrowl. But you can also tell if their tail’s tucked, theirhackles are raised, or the hair on their back is standing up.” Pona has a checklist: “Is the top of their head tight? Are they rigid? Are theirears held backtightly? Is their stare fixed, rather than looking around the room? Is their mouth tight, with the tongue flicking out? That’s a calming signal — it shows they’re anxious.”\nWhen your dog growls, they’re expressing their emotions. A study found that you’ll likely be able to understand what they’re feeling.\nA relaxed dog will have an easy, open-mouthed pant or grin, and when their tail wags, it’s loose, left to right, not just one direction or a tense back and forth in a lower position. “Tension travels from the top of the head down the neck, down the spine, to the tail,” Pona says. “You really have to read the looseness of the skin and the relaxation of mouth and tongue and the rigidity that might go down the spine. If you see all those things relax, and their breathing is slowing, that’s perfect. But very few people know how to read their dogs.”\nWhy not? We spend hours with them, and they’re easy company. Why aren’t we better at this by now? Maybe because our dominant way of communicating is to talk, Pona suggests, and they can’t talk back. “Touch is a substitute for talking,” and we often overdo it because “it bothers us not to share a language with them. Yet it doesn’t bother them at all.”\nIn general, some breeds like Golden Retrievers “can’t get enough petting,” Pona adds. “Labs like to be with you, but Goldens want you touching them. That’s why they do well as comfort dogs. Terriers are more independent. There are many dogs who will find a place next to you and lie down, but without soliciting a pet. So don’t scoot to the edge of your chair and try to pet them.” These preferences don’t always run by breed, however. Much depends on a dog’s past. “Dogs who have no suspicion level like to be touched.” Some high-strung, high-energy dogs crave touch to settle them; others find it overstimulating, like a double espresso.\nThis body language is not as simple as you probably think.\n“People sometimes interpret a dog’s silence as enjoyment,” she adds. “But some dogs are just stoic.” And then they reach a breaking point andsnap. Petting can be a cumulative annoyance:Fine, touch me… Oh, you’re still touching me… OK, stop touching me already!On the other hand, some dogs can’t get enough. Take Rocko, one of Grim’s dogs, who’s completely blind.  “He’s a Pit Bull with a big blockhead, and he’s with special-needs children and adults with autism all the time now,” Grim says. “[People] can’t get over how sweet and kind he is. He knows he can’t see, so he comes up to you and paws you, and if you stop petting, he’ll paw you again to keep going. He just likes the touch, the human contact. It’s emotionally what he needs to survive.”\nMore Dog Petting Pro Tips\nBerloni recommends considering what your dog likes. He learned this through his work: “How do I get dogs to behave on stage, live, in front of 2,000 people eight nights a week? Because everything they experience is positive to them. That forced me to ask, ‘What do you like?’ You’re thinking about the animal first. And once you’ve done that, it opens up this door: They’re like,You get me!And with my rescue dogs, I’m the first person who’s ever gotten them.”\nHis tips? “Gently massage the neck; don’t grab on both sides at the same time and squeeze. The favorite spot I like is right at the base of the tail — just scratching gently.” He avoids skull-thumping, but he does stroke between the dog’s eyebrows. “If you do that very gently, they will just close their eyes. Then I work behind their ears. There are two muscles that connect the neck to the skull, and because of the way they hold their heads at an angle from their body, their necks are always tense. I also scratch very gently inside the ear, where they can’t reach.”\nIf they’re following you around like your shadow, there’s a reason for that.\n“Anything around the whiskers or eye sockets is not fun for a dog,” Berloni warns. “But dogs are ticklish on the hair between their paw pads. Also, there’s a pressure point in that soft, fleshy area between the toes. If your dog’s not accustomed to that and they pull their paw away really quick, let them.” Long, even strokes down the back, with calm energy, are usually welcome. “A lot of times, I just put my hand on their back and send quiet energy through my body.”\n“Dogs often like to be touched below the ears, on their shoulders and neck, and under the jaw,” Pona adds. “For some dogs, a little scratch on the nose with the side of your finger is all they want, and then they’ll go lie down. Some dogs like their ears touched; others are very sensitive about it.” In most cases, Pona adds, “dogs like hair-level touching, not vigorous massage, although they can learn toenjoy massageif they have sore muscles. When I massage them with my fingertips, they’ll go into an open-mouthed, relaxed pant.”\nPona says the biggest mistake people make is when you reach for a dog and they drop and roll, exposing their belly. “That is submission; they are afraid,” she explains. “That’s when I particularly don’t pet them. As we grow as a team, the dog might jump up on the couch and let me know he’s soliciting a tummy rub. Great! But if it’s a new relationship, you really have to pay attention. I’ll back up and stay in my own body space, so they have to come in and solicit those pets.”\n“No touch-y!”\nFor a calm dog, the belly rub is a nearly universal source of pleasure, Grim says. Another of his rescued dogs, a Pit Bull named Baxter, “basically jumps on me and then flips over:OK, I’m ready!And if I stop, he’ll paw at me, so I have to keep going until one of us falls asleep. The belly rub is a dog’s nirvana.” Berloni’s had dogs who weren’t Baxter — dogs who, after a period of rubbing along the ridge of their chest, will “roll over and sigh like they’re done: aaahhhhh. Watch for that. It all goes back to petting to relieve the dog’s stress and not your own.”\nIt’s easy to overstimulate puppies’ wriggly little nervous systems, so touch them only for a while, very deliberately, noticing what the puppy likes but not letting the session go on so long that the pup gets hyper and wants to try out their sharp baby teeth. “Sometimes, it’s good just to read a book to a puppy, so they learn to be with you and look at you.” Grim has found that when they’re trying to relax, dogs like the same things we do: quiet and low lights. There’s a magic period in the afternoon, “the lull of the day,” when they most enjoy petting and naps.\nEven dogs who don’t start out craving cuddles can learn to enjoy them — or to enjoy their person’s enjoyment of them. “It’s the emotional support dogs want to give their people,” Grim says. “I think it’s their way of showing how much they care about you. No other species would put up with what dogs do. We are so lucky to have another species that cherishes us so much.”",

  "page_content": "Your dog has moods. This doesn’t mean they’re moody or that you should stick a mood ring on their paw. (Please, do not make your dog wear jewelry; plus everyone knows those things are bogus.) But there is a pretty clear indication of what they’re feeling in any given moment: their tail.\nThe next time your dog greets you when you come home, closely watch their tail. A dog’s tail speaks volumes, whether it’srigidorswishing circularly, or moving slowly or quickly. Now, add one more mood indicator to the list: the position and direction of a dog’s tail while it wags. Scientists have discovered that a happy dog will wag harder to the right, and an anxious dog will wag harder to the left.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nLeft and Right Brain\nIn humans, it’s well documented that the brain is divided into two cerebral hemispheres — left and right — which serve different functions and control opposite sides of the body. Most animals also demonstrate a difference between “left brain” and “right brain” functions. It is believed that the left brain in animals specializes in “approach and energy enrichment,” such as finding food. The right brain specializes in “withdrawal and energy expenditure,” such as fleeing in response to fear. Because the dog’s tail is located along the body’s midline, researchers questioned whether the tail displayedemotional asymmetry.\nYour dog’s wag and paw preference say a lot about their personality.\nThirty mixed-breed dogs served as the researchers’ subjects. Each dog was put in a kennel specially fitted with cameras to capture the precise angle of the dog’s tail movement. The dog was then shown four separate stimuli — their person, a stranger, a friendly cat, and an unfamiliar, intimidating dog — for one minute each.\nUpon sight of their person, all 30 dogs wagged their tails more strongly to the right side. After a 90-second rest period, the dogs viewed a stranger. The dogs’ tails still favored the right side, but the angle was more moderate in comparison to seeing their person. The cat elicited a bias to the right side, but it was even more subtle than when they saw the stranger. The large, unknown dog caused all of the dogs to wag their tails more to the left.\nDog Tail Position Meaning\nThe authors concluded that when the dog felt positive, or curious (as in the case of the cat), the tail wagged right. If the dog felt negative or apprehensive, the tail wagged left. Because the left brain controls the right side of the body, the right muscles of the tail express those good feelings — the left muscles of the tail signal caution or concern, which is controlled by the right brain.\nIt’s always a good idea to observe yourdog’s body language, whether you’re relaxing at the dog park or waiting to see the vet. Now, thanks to your dog’s tail, you have another way to tell how they really feel.",

    "title": "7 Games That Can Actually Teach Your Dog Something",

  "page_content": "If comedies likeThe OfficeandAbbott Elementaryhave taught us anything, it’s that work doesn’t always have tofeellike work. Of course, most people don’t have entire camera crews following them around at their place of employment, but you get the point.\nTraining your dog can kind of feel like working on a mockumentary sitcom; you’re always working, but it doesn’t come without its funny, entertaining moments (but let’s maybe leave the circa 2005 Michael Scott jokes off the table). School is in session every time you interact with your dog — even during lighthearted play, they are always learning. Here are seven games that’ll teach your dog valuable lessons and help them be upstanding members of society — all while having a blast.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n1. Chase (you)\nConsider this game if you’re convinced that your dog doesn’t like to play; once they’ve been enticed into a game of chase, you may see their fun side come alive.\nAnother plus: When you want to reward your dog but have notreatsor toys handy, chase can be a go-to way to make your dog glad they listened to you. And, because it teaches your dog to move toward rather than away from you, it can help withrecall training. Importantly, your dog must always chase you, not the other way around. Never chase your dog; it will teach them to run away when you approach and ruin their recall.\nKinshipCollective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a stubborn pup to listen up.\nWhile “chase” can easily turn into the not-so-wise-or-fun game of “let’s nip the human’s ankles, legs, or behind,” for the right dog played the right way, it can be a fantastic way to teach your dog to pay attention to you because you’re fun. Change directions often, and to avoid trouble with an aroused dog becomingmouthy, stop running before your dog gets to you.\nOne caveat: I advise against children playing this game unless the dog has a proven record of being able to handle it without becomingoverstimulated, and even then, only with adult supervision.\n2. Fetch\nWhen we think about playing with dogs, this is the game that most often comes to mind.Fetchis a cooperative activity, and each player has a role that must be fulfilled for it to work. (Many people tell me that their dog loves to play fetch and then go on to say that the dog chases the ball but won’t bring it back, or won’t drop it. That’s not fetch — that’s running after a ball and hoarding it.)\nFor some dogs, it’s not as simple as just throwing a ball.\nFetch has a lot to offer, including the skill of dropping an item upon request. It also provides opportunities to work on high-level obedience training. After a few throws, during which the dog has retrieved an item, brought it back to you, and dropped it at your feet, take a short break and ask them to do something specific: sit, down, high-five, or any behavior they can do on cue. Then resume play. Adding this mental stimulation into a game of fetch can be done sporadically so that most sessions are pure fun and games for your dog.\nBy switching between the excitement of running and the discipline of responding to a cue, the dog learns to transition between high arousal and being calm. Teaching dogs to have an on/off switch develops emotional control that will serve them well throughout life. (Another perk: Your dog gets exercise without much effort on your part, which is particularly appealing when you just want to enjoy your morning coffee while your dog burns up some energy.)\nThe most mouth-watering treats for training your pup.\n3. Find Your Treats\nDogs have a lot of fun with this deceptively simple treasure hunt, but the “treasure” must be something your dog cares enough about to search for.Nose workgives your dog mental stimulation, keeps them occupied for a while, and is a great party trick that allows your dog to show off.\nBegin by putting some treats on the floor or furniture without your dog seeing you do it. Say the cue (“find it” or “find your treat” are frequently used) and tap or point to the treats. Repeat…a lot…over many days or weeks. When your dog starts to look for the treats upon hearing the cue, drop the tap or point. Once your dog is familiar with the game, have them stay, then release them to find the treats. At first, hide the treats before you ask them to stay; after your dog’s stay is solid, you can have them do so while you hide the treats, either within sight or even in another room.\nCaveat: If your dog is a food-guarder, skip this game. Also, it may teach your dog to sniff around and get into stuff.\nYou don’t have to look like you belong onBest in Showto be a contender.\n4. Hide-and-Seek\nHere’s another enrichment game that teaches your dog to go on a search, but with you as the focus of the quest. It’s a great way to practice and improve a dog’s ability to come when called. To play, they must already know what “come” means.\nBegin indoors. Call your dog when you are partially out of sight, perhaps crouched down next to a piece of furniture or behind a plant that doesn’t entirely conceal you. When your dog finds you, reinforce them with top-quality stuff — treats, a toy, a bone, a chew, play time, or awalk. Gradually work up to more obscure hiding spots, until you can be completely hidden from sight when you call her.\nAdd in “stay” practice by putting your dog on a stay, hiding, then releasing them and calling them to come. For many dogs, the anticipation of being released makes them respond even more enthusiastically when called.\nThis sounds like a competition show waiting to happen.\nExpect your dog’s recall to improve dramatically if you play this game on a regular basis. You are teaching your dog that “come” means to do it even if you are not in plain view, and because it’s a game with reinforcements, dogs find it fun and worthwhile.\nPlaying this game when you are out in a (safe) off-leash area teaches your dog to keep an eye on you, and helps them understand that if the two of you become separated, they should look for you. And vice-versa — it’s not one-sided.\nCaveat: Disappearing around an aloof dog outside may not prompt any concern at all, and disappearing from view around a clingy dog anywhere may be upsetting.\n5. Family Circle\nThis is a special kind of hide-and-seek in which dogs are told to find a specific person. To play, the dog needs to understand and respond to the “come” cue and you’ll need a few people.\nWhen it’s time to call in reinforcements.\nFirst, have someone else call out your name: “Where’s Karen?” After that, you should call the dog. If they come to you, they get reinforced, but if they go to somebody else, they get ignored. Once you have rewarded your dog for finding you, ask them to find another person. For example, say, “Where’s Rob?” and then Rob should call the dog to come.\nMostdogs learn people’s namesquickly and begin to head to the right person once they hear the name, even before the cue. At that point, you can mix it up — sometimes calling them to come (to maintain a strong recall), sometimes saying only “Where’s [name]?” Once the dog can succeed in that context, up the stakes by having people stay out of sight, perhaps in other rooms, so the dog needs to search.\nLearning the names of everyone in the family is more than just a cool party trick or a practical way to locate someone. It’s also another way to give the dog exercise without a lot of work on your part.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\n6. Tug\nThere are many reasons toplay tug with dogs, and one of the most obvious is that so many of them love it. More reasons: it’s interactive, it’s a way to provide a dog with exercise in a relatively small space, and it can help them stretch before another activity or rev them up before a competition (if that leads to a better performance).\nThe game requires that a dog knows (or learns) how to respond to cues to take a toy and to drop it, which are related skills. Incorporated into the game itself, they are easier to teach. The game is the reward for taking an object, and dropping it can be reinforced with a treat and then resuming the tugging.\nThese skills can be useful in real life as well. Use “take it” when you want your dog to carry something small for you, or “drop it” when they’ve gotten hold of, say, the title to your car, which actually happened to a client of mine.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nWith tug, many dogs also learn to control their mouths and the emotions that can cause their mouths (and the rest of them!) to spiral out of control. Contrary to once-popular opinion, it will not make a behaviorally stable dog “turn aggressive.”\nCaveat: This game can be problematic for dogs who guard objects or those who become aggressive when highly aroused. It’s best for dogs who do not struggle with impulse control orbite inhibition.\n7. Red Light, Green Light\nThis one, borrowed from a game enjoyed by children, teaches dogs to listen to cues even when excited. The impulse control involved in repeatedly stopping and starting is a great life skill that often spreads to other contexts. Sometimes, a dog who is having trouble with self-control will be able to pull it together after several of the transitions between the excited running and stopping that make up the core of this game. Other dogs calm down if you play it in a very tranquil, slow manner. Different styles of the game work best for different dogs.\nIt can be played one-on-one in the living room or during a walk, or in teams in a class setting, with multiple dogs competing to reach a finish line. In order to play, the dog needs to be able to watch the human member of the team and respond to a “sit” or “down” cue.\nHere are some simple steps to pry your pup away from thatonespot in the yard they’re obsessed with.\nWhen they hear “green light,” dogs walk or run next to their human. When they hear “red light,” they must stop and lie down or sit (depending on the skill being worked on and which cue the dog is capable of responding to).\nWhen the game is played in class, if the dog is unable to lie down or sit on cue within three to five seconds, the team pays a penalty — taking three steps backward or returning to the start line, for example.\nThere is more to playing with our dogs than just having a good time, though that’s certainly enough to make it worthwhile. While you and your best friend are having fun, the game serves double duty as a practical way to teach important skills.",

  "page_content": "Every day, at least three times a day, my dog, Cleo, and I take my building’s elevator down to the lobby so she can go on a walk. This means that every day, at least six times a day, I watch her happily sitting in the small, moving box and think, “What does she think is happening right now?”\nWhat does a dog comprehend of a machine that uses an elaborate system of cables and counterweights to transport them and their humans from one floor to another? From Cleo’s perspective, she enters a small room that smells like strangers, the doors slide shut, everything shakes for a few seconds, and when the doors open again, the space outside the room is different than when she first entered it. Does she know we’re moving? If she knows we’re moving, does she know we’re going up and down? Does she believe she’s been teleported? Do I need to find more fulfillment and novelty in my life so I stop spending so much time wondering how my dog perceives the experience of riding an elevator?\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nAny of these breeds are great for city living and available at shelters and rescues.\nPutting that last question aside for now, we can’t really know the answers to the others because, despite our best efforts to peer into dogs’ eyes and glean some understanding of what is doing on inside their soft, sweet heads, humans have completely yet to figure that out. But it’s still important to know how to make our pups’ lives as comfy for them as they can be — including when they walk inside a magical mechanical room.\nSo, howdodogs feel about elevators?\n“It would be totally awesome to be able to put [our dogs] on the couch and say, ‘Hey, how’s this feeling for you? What’s your experience? What are you seeing?’” says Dr. Leslie Sinn, CPDT, DVM, a veterinarian and animal behaviorist in Ashburn, Virginia. “Unfortunately, we don’t have that degree of insight.”\nI reached out to Dr. Sinn because I was curious about what was going on in Cleo’s head when we ride the elevator.  My questions were broad and abstract: How do dogs perceive the world, and how do we interpret what they may or may not be perceiving? How accurate are our interpretations and how well do we really understand our beloved pups? But Dr. Sinn pointed out that for many dog owners, the question of what their dog is experiencing in an elevator is more than just a whimsical thought experiment. It’s a very real challenge. Many of her clients have dogs who struggle in elevators. To Dr. Sinn, this isn’t that surprising. If you’re a dog, she says, riding an elevator might feel something like an earthquake.\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\n“They’re stepping on what is seemingly solid ground, and then all of a sudden the ground is moving,” she explains. “For many dogs, that’s a pretty terrifying experience unless it’s something that they’ve been introduced to early on.”\nBottom line: Elevators are scary.\nAdd to that the fact that elevators are often crammed with strangers, and you have the makings of an extremely stressful situation for a dog. When a dog feels uncomfortable, they can become scared, withdrawn, or, in some cases, reactive.\nWhile we may not know what, exactly, a dog thinks is happening in an elevator, Dr. Sinn says we can easily tell whether a dog is comfortable or not. A comfortable dog will have loose, relaxed body language. They will willingly respond to cues and willingly eat treats if they are offered to them. They will happily hop on the elevator and won’t desperately drag you out as soon as the doors open. An uncomfortable dog, on the other hand, will have stiff, tense body language. They tremble, hunch in a corner, or plaster themselves to the sides of your legs for comfort. “Worst case scenario, they start to become reactive because they’re trying to create space around themselves,” Dr. Sinn cautions.\nWhether you’re stuck in a tiny apartment or living on the road, @KeepingFinn’s Henry Friedman offers tips to not only endure—but thrive.\nThe best way to help a dog be comfortable in an elevator is to make sure they are exposed to the experience early on. But pet parents who have rescued adult dogs don’t have that option. In that case, Dr. Sinn says, there are a couple of ways to help. The first: Avoid the elevator altogether.\n“What I tell a lot of people is, depending on how many floors they have to walk up and down, maybe instead of viewing it as an impediment, they can view it as an opportunity for more exercise,” Dr. Sinn adds, laughing.\nStart small with the elevator.\nBut if the elevator is your only option for any reason, Dr. Sinn says the important thing when familiarizing your dog with the elevator is to start small. “You’ve got to back off a little bit and figure out ways to present it to them in small enough steps that they can handle it.”\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann gives a masterclass on pet parent etiquette for apartment living.\nDr. Sinn recommends calling the elevator during a quiet time of the day when not too many people will be riding it, holding it on your floor for a few minutes, and asking your dog to step in and out of it. As the dog becomes more confident, you can take short trips — just one or two floors —  and when they get off, play with them for a bit or give them a treat. “It starts being a positive experience and a happy thing, instead of something to be dreaded,” she says.\nIf your dog is reactive, Dr. Sinn said it’s important to avoid peak hours so as not to force them into situations where they’re scared. One point Dr. Sinn underscored, is that while many well-meaning pet parents have a tendency to force their dogs into a sort of DIY exposure therapy, and that’s not a helpful approach. In fact, it can often worsen the situation.\nSearching for pet-friendly housing? Reading this should be your first move.\nBe patient with your dog.\n“The impression with these dogs is that, if you do it enough, then all will be will,” she says “But if they’re already worried about the situation, and you keep exposing them to it without changing anything, all it does is confirm their worst fears because every time they’re exposed to it, they’re scared to death.”\nIn the end, we may never know for sure what dogs think is happening in an elevator. And in fairness, even some humans who fully understand elevators absolutely hate riding them. Dr. Sinn encourages parents to be compassionate and patient with their pups.\n“Try to see things through the dog’s eyes, right?” she advises. “Be aware, and realize that for a lot of them, it’s just not within their life experience. So be kind to them.”",

  "page_content": "Sharing space with someone is no small thing. You have no excuse not to pick up after yourself, take the garbage out, and keep the toilet seat down. Sharing your space with a dog is kind of like that, too. As awkward as it feels for you, chances are the feeling’s not only mutual, but even more bewildering for your new pup. New digs. New family. New rules. It’s a lot. Stressing out about your stressed-out dog will get you nowhere. A smooth transition starts with preparation, patience, and structure. Read on for our hard-won wisdom on navigating coupledom with a new dog.\nPreparing for their arrival\nAny intel you can get ahead of time will help your dog adjust to their new home. For example, veterinarian Dr. Katie Lytle recommends asking about any training already underway. “Find out the dog’shousebreakingstatus. Especially with a puppy, it’s helpful to know how often they’re going outside,” she says. “If you can’t be home at those times, can you arrange for someone to come and let them out? That consistency will help your dog complete their training effectively, and that will make things easier for everyone.”\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhich comes first: a nervous person or a nervous pup?\nLearning what you can about your dog’s temperament andpersonalitywill also help you set expectations for how the transition will go. Are you getting a shy dog who may need more alone time, or an outgoing dog who likes to be the center of attention? If you’re adopting from a shelter, Valerie Peck, a certified trainer with the Humane Society for Southwest Washington, recommends asking the adoption coordinator if they have any history on the dog. “The shelter may have information about prior homes or environments where the dog has lived,” she says. “You can also ask questions about the dog’s behavior in the shelter. That doesn’t always reflect how they are going to be in your home but may be a good starting point.”\nThe first few days\nGoing to an unfamiliar home can be stressful —for a dog, too. It’s best to keep things low-key at first. Start by introducing your pup to just one room of the house and make that a safe place for them. This will help them feel more comfortable and help you keep an eye on them. And if you can avoid it, don’t leave your dog at home for long periods of time while they get used to their surroundings. “For the first couple of days, have an open mind and don’t put too many expectations on your dog,” Peck recommends. “They tend tosleep a lot, so make sure they have a quiet area or acratewhere they can rest if they want to. And give them privacy when they’re eating.”\nFor starters:No, they’re not all traumatized andyes, youcanfind a purebred puppy at a shelter.\nAlso, as much as your friends and family aredyingto meet your new dog (and you’re equally dying to show them off), hold off on introducing your pup to their new entourage because, you know, meeting new people can be overwhelming. Peck’s advice: “Limit it to meeting immediate family, playing in the yard, and walking in the neighborhood while your dog decompresses.” Above all, be patient. You and your new dog will need some time to figure each other out. Not everything will go exactly as planned, and that’s okay.\nWhat to expect with a shelter dog\nShelter dogs come from various backgrounds, so the experience of introducing them to a new home is going to vary from dog to dog. However, you can get a sense for how things might go using the handy “Rule of Threes.” Peck explains the math: “The first three days are very overwhelming for dogs. Because it’s a new environment, they may either beshyeror rowdier than usual. After three weeks, they’ll start getting into a routine. At that point, you’ll see more of their personality, and they’ll start to feel like they’re part of the family. After three months, they’ll be pretty settled in, and you can expect to see your dog’s true colors.” The most rewarding part of the journey is witnessing all their “firsts” as they learn to trust: wagging their tail, rolling over for a belly rub, figuring outfetch. Before long, you won’t remember what life was like without them.\nOur room-to-room guide to get your house in dog-safe shape.\nSetting boundaries and establishing routines\nDogs like to know what’s expected of themandwhat to expect from others. In fact, they often find uncertainty stressful. To help them feel at ease in their new environment, establish a set of rules and routines for your dog, and get everyone on board with following them. Is your dog going to be allowed on the couch? Will any rooms be off-limits? Have you thought through the ideal schedule for walks and meals? Dogs arepeople pleasersat heart, but if the rules change depending on which human is around, your dog will be confused. Everyone in the household should be on the same page.\nGetting to know your dog\nFiguring out your new pup’s personality and quirks is one of the best parts of being a pet parent. But how do you start building that relationship? “Dogs are social animals,” Dr. Lytle says. “By nature, they’re going to want to be part of the family, but the types of interactions they enjoy will vary. I recommend that every pet parent learn the basics of reading a dog’s body language. That will give you valuable clues into how your dog is feeling in any given situation.”\nFinally, try not to compare your new dog to pups you’ve had in the past because every dog is unique. “It’s important to recognize that not every dog is going to be stimulated or enticed by the same things,” Dr. Lytle adds.  “If you know your dog’s breed mix, that can help you find activities that align with their natural preferences. Once you find out what motivates your dog, that will unlock opportunities for training and trust-building.” Dogs don’t come with manuals, but building that one-of-a-kind relationship isn’t just part of the experience.

  "page_content": "Your pup’s practically fresh out of the womb, and you’ve been nothing but encouraging to them, but for some reason they still hover by your feet instead of hanging with their peers. First of all, there’s probably nothing to worry about: Just like people, some dogs are naturally more extroverted than others. So, don’t blame yourself or wonder what went wrong because genetics play a big role in a dogs’ temperament — and your pup can live a full, happy life, anyway.\nIf you have siblings (or keep up with the Kardashians), you’re probably not even alittleshocked that littermates can grow into adults who are wildly different from each other. Siblings, whether human or canine, aren’t clones — even identical twins have differences in their DNA. No matter how similar the upbringing, minor differences in siblings’ genetic makeup and their time in the womb account for major differences in behavior. Below, find out some scientific reasons that some puppies are shy orfearful, while others are more outgoing.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a shy pup to go from wallflower to social butterfly.\nThe Genetics of a Shy Puppy\nYou’re probably acquainted with physical variation in dogs, from flat-nosed Pugs to skinny-muzzled Salukis. But, this genetically mediated variation is equally true of behavioral predispositions. These differences are all thanks to the genetic makeup of each dog, which is unique to that individual. After all, the point of sexual reproduction — an inefficient and messy process (genetically speaking) — is variation.\nEach parent contributes one strand of DNA to the double helix that makes up each chromosome, and the strands link up in unique ways each time a new life is created. That said, every individual is the result of a unique combination of genes. In an environment with a range of conditions — perhaps a drought one year and floods the next — genetic variation increases the odds that some individuals will survive even if others perish, thus ensuring the continuation of at least some individuals of their particular species.\nDo your research. Know the facts.\nAccording to research on personality done over the past 30 years, one of the most heritable behavioral characteristics is called the “shy-bold continuum,” which has been found to be a relatively stable aspect of personality in some primates, cattle, people, and dogs (to name a few).\nIt appears as though different points on the “shy-bold” spectrum are advantageous at different times. For example, primatologist Steve Suomi has found that in some conditions, shy malerhesus monkeyshave higher reproductive success than bold ones. The shy males wait longer to leave their natal troops and arrive at a new troop larger and better able to hold their own when challenged by established males.\nYou can imagine how, in some contexts, the ancestors of domestic dogs might be best served by boldness (being the first to venture near a human settlement) or by caution and timidity (steering clear of lions).\nPro tips for boosting the confidence of a scaredy-cat dog.\nDifferent Experiences in the Womb\nBeyond an understanding of the role of genetics, research is increasingly focused on the effect of in-utero experiences on the development and, ultimately, the health and behavior of an individual.\nUntil recently, developmental considerations have focused on the influence of genetics and the environment during “early development” — the old nature/nurture argument. The period defined as “early development” began at birth and followed an animal through infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. But there’s also the important influence of in-utero experiences, an environment never before considered as having an effect on an adult animal.\nIn general, the influence of a mother’s experience on her fetus is profound: Hersleep patternteaches the developing pup about the cycle of day and night. Her food preferences influence her puppy’s after birth. If the mother is seriously deprived of food, her pup will be predisposed todiabetesand high cholesterol as an adult.\nMost relevant to a shy puppy, a mother suffering from extreme anxiety puts her offspring at high risk of beinganxiousand fearful, even as an adult. Apparently, high levels of the stress hormone cortisol produced by the mother result in fewer cortisol receptor cells in the pup. This low number of receptor cells means that the pup’s brain is unable to perceive and respond to high levels of cortisol in their own body until the system is overloaded with it. Then the brain goes on red alert, sending the emotions into full panic mode, even in situations that would be only mildly stressful for an average individual.\nFind out which dog breed is right for your lifestyle.\nIn addition to the significant effect of a mother’s influence on her young, we also know now that each individual’s experience within the uterus is different. Minordifferences in nutrients, for example, have long been known to be a factor in major differences in the size and health of animals within a litter. Even genetic clones — identical twins, for example — aren’t behaviorally identical. Though they may look alike, they usually have remarkably different personalities. Since they developed with the same set of genes, only in-utero experiences can account for their behavioral differences. Developmental psychologists are learning that for twins, development in the womb is a kind of dance between the two that, by the time they are born, has shaped their personalities.\nAnother example of the influence of in-utero development is what’s called “androgenization.” In this phenomenon,femalesin a litter are permanently affected by the androgen produced by male puppies surrounding them within the uterine horns. Androgen is the precursor to testosterone, and females who are “bathed” in it, perhaps because of their placement between a large number of males, tend to behave differently than other females once they develop into adults.\nAnd so, even prior to birth, profoundly different experiences could have shaped puppies from the same litter. The combination of different genetic blueprints and different experiences inside the womb resulted in two dogs with very different personalities and tolerances. Even though they have grown up together, those beginnings mean that a similar environment will affect them in different ways as they continue to develop. Your shy puppy will probably always be more cautious than other outgoing pups — because much of who they are was established before they were born.",

  "page_content": "All dogs come equipped with powerful jaws and sharp teeth, but most save them for marrow bones, chews,or Kongs— a quality that makes for good pets and great friends. Unfortunately, your dog will likely experience unpleasant or stressful incidents at some point in their life (don’t we all?), but dogs with proper bite inhibition can consciously control their behavior and respond in a way that does not cause much (if any) damage. That’s why bite inhibition is so valuable.\nIf an injured or freaked-out dog air-snaps or inhibits their bite so effectively that contact with another dog or person causes no pain or injury, that’s a manageable problem by most people’s standards. If a dog with poor bite inhibition is in the same situation and inflicts serious damage, it’s a potentially disastrous problem from a physical, emotional, and even legal standpoint.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat is bite inhibition?\nAs puppies, dogs are typically taught to control the force of their bites. The degree to which dogs learn not to use the full force of their mouths on people and other dogs is called “bite inhibition,” and it is the most important part of a dog’s education.\nAnd save your skin.\nHaving good bite inhibition doesn’t mean a dog won’tkill squirrelsortear up their chew toys. Bite inhibition is all about exercising control in social situations, but that doesn’t necessarily apply to predatory behavior or playing with objects.\nWhy teach bite inhibition?\nBite inhibition is important because if a gate is left open, a leash breaks, or a person barges in unannounced, and your dog gets scared,they could bark,lunge, or snap. How they respond depends on their training. As a result, someone could be badly and even permanently injured, require medical care, such as surgery, or be deeply traumatized by an untrained dog. As a pet parent, you must be committed to working with your dog to improve their behavior. If you think your dog wouldn’t respond in such a manner, consider the following incidents from my own case files.\nA visiting child loses his temper when the family dog distracts him during a game of ping-pong by yawning and whining. The child hits the dog in the face with the ping-pong paddle, and the dog runs away yelping. A teenager tries to dress up her dog to match her own outfit, and the dog resists. As she continues forcing the clothes on him, he whines and struggles. After several minutes, the dog growls andsnaps at her facebut makes no contact. A toddler tries to climb on her sleeping dog to ride him like a horse. The dog stands up and begins to walk away, but when she tries once again to get on his back, he bites her on the shoulder, causing a bruise.\nStep one: Never put your face close to theirs.\nAn elderly man trips and falls onto his dog while the dog is eating. The dog bites the man on the leg, leaving no mark. When a man reaches to pet his friend’s dog, his watch catches on the dog’s collar. He gently tries to disentangle himself, and the dog bites him on the leg, leaving two puncture marks and some bruising. A woman walks into her dining room, sees a dog toy under the table and reaches down to get it. Her dog, exhibiting extremeresource guarding, races in and bites her arm repeatedly, resulting in multiple punctures along with fractures to her wrist and arm that require several surgeries to fix.\nIt’s easy to see how a dog might become distressed. Yet, the dogs in each case responded differently, and the seriousness was not directly related to the injustice or pain suffered by the dog, but rather, to the dog’s ability to exercise proper bite inhibition. It’s no exaggeration to say that bite inhibition can be the difference between success and failure in treating behavior problems and even between life and death for the dog.\nEarly experiences\nExperience with play-biting and mouthing often leads to better bite inhibition, and like anything else, those who practice become the most skilled. Littermates are a puppy’s first teachers, one of several reasons that it’s beneficial for puppies to stay with their litter for about two months. As the young dogs play, they use their mouths to tug or gnaw on their siblings’ ears, tails, paws, and loose skin. If one puppy mouths another too hard, the puppy who got hurt will yelp, stop playing, and move away. This teaches puppies that hard bites, even if not intended to cause pain, result in an interruption in play.Singleton puppiesand those taken from their litter before the age of five or six weeks often lack proper bite inhibition. It seems that puppies need their littermates’ feedback to learn to control the pressure they exert with their mouths.\nOne doesn’t have to be the loneliest number when it comes to your dog.\nOnce puppies head to new homes, their education needs to continue, and that includes socialization with other puppies and dogs. This does not mean throwing a puppy into the dog-park fray and hoping it will all work out. In that setting, puppies are far too likely to be overwhelmed and to experience it as we might experience a gladiator pit. Rather, it means supervised play dates with carefully selected and well-behaved canines.\nTeaching bite inhibition\nLessons from people are also useful in teaching bite inhibition. Although using their mouths on our hands, arms, legs, hair, and clothes is natural behavior for them, dogs must learn to interact in ways that are appropriate in your world.\nAn effective technique, one based on puppies’ earlier experiences with their littermates, is to startle and then redirect the young offender. If a puppy mouths too hard, yelp with a puppy-like sound (Aaarp! is the closest description of this sound that can be spelled), which often interrupts the puppy’s biting. Take advantage of that pause in the behavior by immediately giving the puppy something appropriate to chew on. Good options include bones, chew toys, Kongs, squeaky toys, and stuffed animals.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nBegin by startling and redirecting the puppy only in response to the most forceful bites. Employing this approach with every instance of mouthing can be overwhelming to the puppy, who is, after all, doing what comes naturally and exploring the world by mouth. So, the first goal is to teach the puppy not to mouth so hard rather than not to mouth at all.\nWhen the hardest bites have been inhibited, the next step is to startle and redirect after medium-force bites. Spend time working at each level to ensure that your dog has a firm understanding.\nFinally, once the puppy has learned to mouth people with only the gentlest of pressure, teach them not to do this at all by employing the same technique in response to any occasion in which their teeth touch delicate human skin, hair, or clothes.\nA common mistake when using this method is to make the yelping sound and then fail to redirect the puppy. In most cases, although the sound will startle the puppy into a break in the mouthing, they will go right back to it unless given another, more appropriate object to focus on. Many people begin by doing both steps (startle and redirect), but as time goes on, they switch to startling without bothering to redirect. It’s important to stay consistent.\nA dog behaviorist schools us on why puppy classes are more about socializing than getting straight As.\nWhile more than 90 percent of puppies will respond to this method if it is used correctly and consistently, some dogs seem to get worse in response to high-pitched yelps, becoming even mouthier and more revved up. For those dogs, it’s usually effective to startle the dog with a deep-voiced “Hey!” or “Ouch!” Otherwise, the technique of interrupting the behavior and then redirecting the dog to an appropriate object is the same. If the puppy fails to respond to either sound, walk away so that they learn that biting brings an end to the fun.\nMouthing myths\nThere are many recommendations out there for stopping puppy mouthing, and I advise against most of them because they are inhumane and generally ineffective.Do nothold the dog’s muzzle closed, yell at the dog, jam your fingers into the dog’s mouth, or swat the dog. Basically, it comes down to one piece of general advice: Don’t do anything that involves any kind of physical punishment that causes pain or frightens the dog.\nProper bite inhibition is incredibly important, and developing it requires lessons early in life. The normal process of learning bite inhibition is linked with puppy development and it can’t usually be learned later in life with the same degree of success. Dogs without this essential skill may cause severe damage — punctures, painful bruising, and even broken bones on occasion. Learning bite inhibition is one of the first and most essential lessons for puppies because it is about safety as well as being a well-behaved, polite member of society.",

  "page_content": "You know when your dog is happy or playful, when they desperately want a bite of your snack or a leisurely walk around the neighborhood. You know their expressions and their moods and could easily pick your pup out of a lineup of similar-looking dogs. You may even pride yourself on knowing your dog better than you know anyone else. And if you wake up every day thinking that your human friends might be mad at you for some reason (as many millennials do), at least you can always count on dogs to be on your side. Right?Right?\nThe reality is you may not know your dog quite as well as you think you do. ADecember 2022 studyled by the DogStudies research group at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology found that humans aren’t the best atrecognizing aggression in dogs— or even in other humans. This lack of recognition can lead to serious danger, especially when approaching a strange dog.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nKinship spoke to Dr. Juliane Bräuer, DogStudies Research Group Leader and senior author of the research article, to explore why you may be misinterpreting one of your dog’s biggest emotions.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nThe study explored humans’ ability to classify interactions and predict outcomes.\nResearchers showed 92 participants videos of nonverbal interactions between pairs of humans, dogs, and primates. The participants were split into two groups, with one group categorizing the interactions in the 27 videos as playful, neutral, or aggressive, and the other group predicting the outcome of each social interaction.\nThe participants managed to predict accurate outcomes in 50 percent to 80 percent of the videos. But their ability to identify behaviors and predict what would happen next largely depended on whether the participants were viewing a video of primates, dogs, or humans. In fact, to the researchers’ surprise, participants in the study performed especially poorly when it came to recognizing aggressive interactions in both dogs and their fellow humans.\nDr. Bräuer notes, however, that the results of the study are a bit more complicated than they appear at first glance. While participants may have struggled with categorizing the video interactions, they were much better at predicting emotions, which is more crucial in an evolutionary sense than simply identifying emotions.\nWant help with your pet's behavior right now?

For under $5/month.\nRecognizing aggression is not humans’ strong suit.\nThe experimenters involved in the study expected their subjects to have no problem recognizing aggression in dogs. After all, dogs are known as man’s best friend for a reason, and our long history of interacting with canines should suggest that we are able to read their emotions and body language fairly well.\nBut on this count, researchers were proven wrong. In fact, participants performed especially poorly when it came to spotting aggressive interactions, regardless of whether they were dog parents or not. In past similar studies, Dr. Bräuer says, researchers have found that dog parents have no advantage over non-parents when it comes to recognizing aggression.\n“We know that dogs are very good at reading humans,” Dr. Bräuer says, noting that this is a skill that dogs have developed over time throughout their evolution from wolves. “But we’re not only bad at recognizing aggression; we’re also bad at predicting what’s happening in a playful interaction, where it’s not so clear. For example, maybe one of the dogs didn’t mean to be aggressive, but the other dog perceived it that way.”\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nThankfully, we’re not too shabby when it comes to understanding dogs’ more obviously playful intentions with each other and can generally tell play-fighting from the real deal. So, when you see your pupmake a new friendat the dog park, you’re probably easily able to tell if things are going well. However, humans tend to underestimate aggression in dogs, unless the emotion is severe, such as when a dog is snarling or offeringwarning growls.\nOur love for our pups (and all dogs) may cause bias.\nResearchers theorize that one reason we may struggle to recognize aggression is simply because we love dogs and assume the best of any canine we see, regardless of what their expressions and body language may tell us.\n“We have this picture that we are nice humans, and these are nice, cute, little dogs,” Dr. Bräuer says. “We expect the best of both dogs and humans.”If you’re like most pet parents, you’re constantly snapping photos of your precious pup and speaking to them in a baby voice that would embarrass you if anyone heard it. So, maybe it’s no surprise that our love for dogs could keep us from realizing when they’re truly angry.\nThis body language is not as simple as you probably think.\nDogs express aggression in a variety of ways, including growling, barking, and snarling, and sometimes even their play with other dogs can seem violent. But playful dogs tend to avoid biting down on their playmates or even roll over on their backs or let themselves be caught during an intense chase. Genuinely aggressive dogs, however, show no signs of backing down, and their bite is often much worse than their bark.\nWe’re Also Not Great at Reading Human Aggression\nMaybe the most surprising part of the study is the revelation that humans aren’t even skilled in recognizing aggression ineach other. Just as bias may blind us to the genuine feelings of canines, we may automatically assume the best of our fellow man as well. So, unless someone is obviously angry with you (we’re talking screaming and cursing), you may miss the signs of aggression even in people around you.\n“With severe aggression, no matter the species, we’re good at recognizing it,” Dr. Bräuer says. “When it’s more subtle, then it starts to be more difficult.”No matter how much you love your dog or dogs in general (it’s probablya lot), it’s important to understandhow they communicateso you can better meet their needs and speak in their language. Love can certainly bridge the divide between you and your dog, but it never hurts to learn a little more about your four-legged best friend — which will only help you translate that love into body language (and plenty of pets and kisses).",

  "page_content": "Dogs rely on humans to meet their physical and emotional needs. We are their people and their best friends, so it only makes sense that when someone else wants our attention, they might notlovethat. As an animal behaviorist and dog trainer, I definitely believe that dogs experience jealousy.\nOver the years,researchhas provided ample evidence in support of this claim. The most likely rivals for a dog are the other dogs in the household, which is why scientists studied dogs’ behavior when guardians paid attention to their other dogs. In a2018 studypublished inAnimal Cognition, they did not find compelling evidence that dogs exhibited jealous behaviors, but small sample sizes and high individual variability may have masked any effects that do exist.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nResearching Jealousy in Dogs\nA 2021studyin the journalPsychological Scienceinvestigated jealousy in dogs in situations in which the dogs can’t see their rival. Researchers studied 18 dogs and their reactions to their parents’ interactions. The dogs in the study observed their parents in close proximity to a realistic fake dog. Then, a barrier was placed to block the dog’s view of the fake dog, at which point the parent began to pet the fake dog behind the barrier. (The dogs being studied could still see the humans.) The dogs were also observers when the experiment was repeated, this time, with the humans sitting by a fleece tube and petting that tube after the barrier went up.\nChange is hard, but that doesn’t mean you should feel bad.\nIn the trials with the tube, the fake dog was also present and next to the human, but the human did not pay any attention to the dog. Researchers used the presence of the fake dog to tease apart the influence of thepresenceof the fake dog and theinteractionbetween them and the parent.\nTo do this, they measured the force with which the dogs pulled toward their parents in each situation. Pulling harder in the direction of the person was considered a sign of jealousy. (Studies of jealousy in young children also measure the effort these children make to approach their parents when the parent’s attention is on another activity.)\nBased on the increased force the dogs had while pulling toward their parents when they were petting the fake dog, the researchers claim to have found evidence of jealous behavior in dogs. The dogs pulled hardest when the parents interacted with a perceived social rival (another dog), with an average force of more than twice than what they used when their parents were petting a fleece cylinder. Additionally, the dogs reacted with strong force when their human was interacting with another (fake) dog, even if they couldn’t see that interaction.\n...Without turning your home into a circus.\nMixed Results\nThe researchers concluded that dogs acted jealously when their parents gave attention to another dog, even if that other dog was not visible. They also concluded that the dogs did not act jealous when their parent gave attention to an inanimate object, nor when their humans were near another dog but not paying any attention to that dog. Finally, they determined that the dogs could have a reaction to the interaction without actually seeing it.\nIn my opinion, this study has issues that raise questions about the conclusions. The only behavioral measure taken was the force of the pulling, which can also signal that the dogs simply want to join the interaction. Many dogs enjoy socializing with both people and dogs, and those dogs are likely to pull toward their human when another dog is engaging with that person. It’s also possible that the pulling simply reflected attention-seeking behavior, which does not necessarily mean the dog was experiencing jealousy.\nI have two issues with this research paper. One is the presentation of jealousy in dogs as a ground-breaking idea, and the other is the failure of this paper to demonstrate jealousy in dogs. I don’t think this study (or some of the earlier work on the same subject) provides compelling evidence of jealousy in dogs. Butthere are studiesthat have been more convincing, and I certainly don’t think it makes sense to view jealousy as uniquely human.\nThere’s a lot more to it than sniffing each other’s butts.\nThis study investigates canine jealousy, which is great, but it does not adequately eliminate other explanations for the behavior observed in the study. (It does, however, make a reasonable case that dogs can form mental representations of interactions between their parent and a dog who is out of sight.)\nThe Takeaway\nThe bottom line: Dogsdoexperience jealousy. As author and behaviorist Patricia B. McConnell, PhD writes in the bookFor the Love of a Dog: Understanding Emotion in You and Your Best Friend: “Jealousy doesn’t strike me as a particularly complicated emotion. I see tension and aggression between dogs on a weekly basis that seem little different from behavior that we wouldn’t hesitate to call jealousy in young, preverbal children. It all seems to come down to ‘You’ve got it, I don’t, and I’m not happy about that.’ It’s unimaginable to me that they don’t have some sense of missing out on something good. Surely your dog knows when you’re petting another dog that he’s not being petted himself.”",

  "page_content": "You can give up on hiding treats and spelling out “W-A-L-K”: As it turns out, your dog is a regular clairvoyant. OK, fine, it’s not that simple (and you don’t have to don a tinfoil hat yet). But as Lucrezia Lonardo and Ludgiw Huber detailed in a new scientific report,”Canine perspective-taking,” scientists are working to prove something that a lot of pet parents have already guessed: Our dogs know a lot about what we know.\nResearchers are using all kinds of methods to understand whether our pups are able to walk a mile in our shoes. But as fun as these science experiments are to read about, they’re super relevant to pet parenting, too. As Shannon Kundey, one of the authors of “Domesticated dogs (Canis familiaris) react to what others can and cannot hear,” says: “I think the important takeaway from studies exploring cognition in nonhuman animals is that there’s lots of interesting science going on to answer some of the questions that pet parents have wanted answers to. I would encourage pet parents to pay attention to the scientific literature, as science is likely to provide them with interesting insights into their pets.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nApparently wild dogs can be pretty cute, too.\nBelow are some of the coolest things about dog mind-reading (OK, fine, “perspective-taking”) that scientists have discovered — and the clever ways they went about their research.\nDogs know when we’re paying attention\nNot a huge surprise, but still worth saying: Our pups can tell when we’re not focused on them — and they’re less likely to give us the time of day in return. Inone study, dogs were asked to lie down for a duration of time. When the owner stayed facing the dog with their eyes on them, the dog would stay lying down. But when the owner looked away or seemed otherwise distracted, such as by reading a book or watching TV, the dogs were more likely to give up on following the cue. It’s sort of the puppy equivalent of passing notes in class when the teacher starts grading papers.\nIn asimilar study, dogs were given the chance to beg for food held by two humans: one who wasn’t facing the dog and making eye contact and one who was. The dogs preferred to beg to the human who was making eye contact, showing that they know when people are more likely to engage with their behavior. So, hot tip for next snack-time: Your pup might give up faster if you give them the cold shoulder.\nResearch finds that your pup can smell when you’ve been doom-scrolling, and they get bummed out.\nDogs know what we see\nIt might seem a little obvious to dog parents that dogs know when we’re paying attention to them — otherwise, they wouldn’t have gotten so darn good at doing adorably attention-grabbing things like, say, plopping their heads straight onto our keyboards when we’re busy with work. So researchers went a step further and investigated whether dogs can understand what humans cansee. This is called Level 1 perspective-taking — and it turns out dogs are great at it.\nTo test this,researchersplaced a barrier between an experimenter and a bowl of food. As summarized by Lonardo and Huber, “dogs stole forbidden food more often when the orientation and location of a visual barrier prevented an experimenter from seeing them, compared to when the barrier was present but ineffective in blocking the experimenter’s view (due to its position and orientation).” In other words, they could tell when the barrier was actually working.\nAnimal communicators in NYC and LA illuminate us on what your pets are really thinking.\nIn one experiment, “Deceptive-like behaviour in dogs (Canis familiaris),” researchers gave dogs the choice between two forbidden treats: one behind an opaque barrier that the experimenter couldn’t see through and one behind a transparent barrier that both the dog and experimenter could see. The dogs first stole the treat behind the opaque barrier, showing that they’re able to consider what the experimenter can see. Interestingly, breed matters: independent working dogs (like scent hounds, sledge, and sight hounds) were more likely to sneak around and first steal the treat behind the opaque barrier, while cooperative dogs (like shepherds, retrievers, and pointers) didn’t show a preference for stealing one treat first.\nDogs know what we hear\nShannon Kundey tells Kinship that she decided to research how dogs react to what humans hear because, “I think it’s important to explore how other species view the world generally. I think it helps us to learn about other species as well as ourselves as humans.” Inher study, Kundey and other researchers provided dogs with a silent container and a noisy container, then forbid them from taking food from either. The researchers guessed that if the human who had forbidden them from taking the food was present but not looking at the dog or containers, the dogs would try to get the food from the silent container.\nCognitive Science professor Dr. Federico Rossano on how Bunny, TikTok’s “talking” dog, is sparking change in how we communicate with our pets.\nThey were right: When their humans looked away, the dogs would sneak food from only the quiet container. This builds on the previous evidence that dogs know when people are paying attention, plus proves that they know that noise will alert us, even when we’re looking away. Like a teenager avoiding the creaky stair when sneaking out of the house, our dogs are well aware of what might perk up our ears.\nDogs know what we believe\nBuckle in, because we’re getting a little more abstract. Inthis experiment, one person (labeled “the Knower”) hides food or watches the food be hidden, and the other (“the Guesser”) is out of the room when the food is hidden. In each case, the dog isn’t able to see the location of the food. The Knower then points to the correct container, and the Guesser points to an incorrect one. The dogs greatly preferred obeying the location pointed to by the Knower — in fact, they not only distrusted a human who was out of the room when the food was hidden, but they also disobeyed the cue of a human who “looked at the ceiling or covered her eyes with her hands during the food hiding process.”\nIn a similar experiment, the Guesser and Knower behaved identically, but one knelt on the side of a barrier that hid the hiding process. Dogs preferred to follow the Knower over the Guesser, meaning that — even when it wasn’t obvious — they were able to imagine what the Guesser and Knower could and couldn’t see.\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nDogs know when wedon’tknow\nIn this experiment, dogs witnessed a human hiding food in bucket A and then moving it in their hands into bucket B. They could also see what the “communicator” — the person giving the dog directions — could see from across the room. For half the dogs, the food was transferred in full view of the communicator, while for the other half, the communicator didn’t see the switch. All the dogs — regardless of whether their communicator had seen the switch or not — were then told to retrieve the food from bucket A.\nThe majority of dogs went straight to bucket B (duh — they know where the food is, and they want it now!), but of those who went to bucket A, more did so when the communicator hadn’t seen the switch. Dogs responded to “the communicator’s apparent knowledge” of where the food was; they followed along with incorrect directions given by ignorant instructors, but not with incorrect instructions given by instructors who knew better.\nThe next time they try to kiss your face while you’re in corpse pose, let them.\nIt’s possible that they followed the incorrect direction because they saw it as, as Lonardo and Huber put it, a “’justified’ mistake in ‘good faith.’” Interestingly, Terriers, who are considered independent breeds, were much less likely to follow the incorrect direction than Border Collies, who are considered a cooperative worker breed. This means, unsurprisingly, cooperative breeds might be a little more loyal — but also a little more willing to be led astray — than independent breeds.\nSo…are dogs really reading minds? What does it all mean?\nLonardo and Huber summarize: “dogs are exquisite readers of our behavior” — and they might even have “a rudimentary theory of mind,” which is a set of skills used to understand the mental states of others when it comes to their beliefs, intentions, and goals. A theory of mind helps creatures have empathy, but also helps them manipulate (unsurprising to anyone who has fallen victim topuppy-dog eyes). It’s long been understood to be a uniquely human cognitive feature, but all this new research is breaking that idea open.\nYour pup doesn’t only know what you see and hear; they also know a bit about what you believe and how you think. So don’t bother trying to get anything past them, including the belly rub you have planned for later — they’re way ahead of you.",

  },
  "page_content": "Do you feel like your dog isignoring you? Well, maybe that’s because you’re giving them some bad advice. At least that’s what a group of Yale researchers propose. Theysuggestthat, as much as dogs like to follow our lead, dogs are free-thinkers, and they’ll ignore lousy tips that don’t serve their best interests. But there are a few holes in their argument. So, let’s look into how they arrived at this claim, which isn’t necessarily supported by the data.\nThe Bad-Advice Experiment\nResearchers were looking to explore something called “overimitation” in dogs. In humans, children will overimitate when they perform all the steps they have been shown, even when some of them are unnecessary. This uncritical copying of the behavior they observe may allow kids to minimize the amount of trial-and-error learning they must do.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nIn this study, scientists investigated whether dogs (and dingoes) would imitate the way people showed them how to get food out of a puzzle box, even when there was an easier way to do it. Only one step was required to reach the food, and that was lifting the lid to a box. As part of the experiment, humans added an extra, unnecessary action to the process by pulling a lever that did nothing and then lifting the lid of the box.\nApparently wild dogs can be pretty cute, too.\nBoth the dogs and the dingoes quickly learned to skip the step with the useless lever and just open the box to get to the treat inside. In other words, itlookedlike they ignored the useless instructions from the humans. The experimenters consider this evidence that both species learned that pulling the lever was an unnecessary step for opening the box, even though they saw humans doing it.\nGetting to the Real Question\nSo, the data set shows that both dogs and dingoes found that the lever was irrelevant. But here’s the kicker: This study does not find any evidence that dogs imitated the humans at all. Observing the humans pull the lever did not make any difference to them — the dogs were doing it completely on their own.How do we know? In addition to the bad-advice experiment, there were also a series of box-opening trials (with a different set of animals) in which dogs and dingoes were given a puzzle box, and they still didn’t use the lever — even without observing a human opening it. The authors write that “dogs were equally likely to use the irrelevant lever,” regardless of whether they witnessed a demonstration or not.\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nThey point out that there was no evidence that dogs were more likely to copy the humans’ actions than the dingoes were, but what’s just as important is that there was no evidence that the dogs were copying humans at all.\nWhile it would be easy to come to the conclusion that dogs ignore bad advice from humans, this study doesn’t prove it. They would first need to show that dogs copy any human behavior, then test whether dogs copy irrelevant human behavior. There has been (and continues to be) extreme skepticism about dogs and this sort of imitation.\nDingoes vs. Dogs\nThere was one interesting conclusion from this study, though it has nothing to do with imitation, social learning, or human influence on dogs’ actions. Evidence from this study, as well as previous research, indicates that dingoes solve problems more quickly and with greater success than dogs.\nIt’s important to remember that dogs are individuals, so training isn’t one-size-fits-all.\nIn a third experiment, researchers offered dogs and dingoes a different puzzle box, where pulling the lever was an essential step in opening this particular puzzle box. Both dogs and dingoes did pull the lever in order to access the treat inside. Dingoes were more likely than dogs to pull the lever only when it was relevant, unlike dogs, who pulled it quite often, even when it was not an essential part of the box-opening task.",

  "page_content": "Has your dog ever looked at you andsighedlike they have the weight of the world on their shoulders? As we sift through more tax forms to pay the government yet again, it’s hard not to roll our eyes. What should they, whose biggest problem is choosing the right spot in the living room to chew their bully stick, have to worry about? In truth, your dog probably isn’t complaining about all of life’s burdens; they’re just bored.\nDogs are intelligent, social, and emotional beings who, yes, can get easily bored. Providing a pup with a high quality of life depends heavily on enrichment. Enrichment can take many forms: There’s social time with other dogs and other people; tasks that make pups feel important for having a job; sensory enrichment, such as stimulating sight, sound, or smell; and nutritional enrichment — which doesn’t mean richer food — it means giving the dog a food-toy that challenges how quickly and easily they can scarf their dinner down.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nOn the physical enrichment end, it’s important that toys and activities encourage a positive expression of natural behaviors. For example, Terriers love to dig, so an outdoor sandbox will stop them from digging through your carpet. All these aspects of the dog’s environment keep dogs in good physical and psychological condition and keep them from emitting yet another long, drawn-out sigh.\nWoof’s innovative fillable design will help dogs de-stress and their parents save money.\nIs My Dog Bored?\nBored dogs will do things you don’t want them to (does that hole in your favorite cozy couch blanket ring a bell?). Without your constructive direction, dogs will often make up their own amusements that don’t amuse you. Signs that your dog is bored are: barking or biting for attention, getting in the trash, destructive chewing, jumping, and lots of other mischiefs. They might also sleep more, sigh, or be on alert. Truly, there’s no creature on earth more creative than a frustrated pup.\nHow to Help a Bored Dog\nThere are many ways to bring joy into your dog’s day besides feeding them treats and asking, “Who’s a good doggo?!” Dogs need so much stimulus because their wild canine ancestors faced puzzles and challenges every day in their search for food, water, and shelter. We have all those things covered for our pups, but that brain energy needs to go somewhere. Here are some suggestions for channeling that energy in an appropriate way for the whole household’s sake.\nLike your Peloton instructor has probably told you as you turn the dial to add resistanceonce again, there’s nothing like exercise to boost serotonin and endorphin production, and a simpledog walkdoes a lot to increase physical activity and stimulation for your dog. It can also benefit the dog in terms of social interaction, meeting other dogs and friendly people along the way. You might make a friend, too.\nBad weather? These activities will keep your dog (and you!) from going stir crazy.\nIf you can’t get a long walk in, try a “flirt-pole.” A flirt pole is a simple tool to help you drag a toy on the ground in a circle to be chased and tugged by the dog. Flirt poles are super easy toDIY at home. Ten minutes of toy chase with a flirt pole will work out the dog without tiring you, fulfill their naturalprey instinct, and work on your dog’s cue response skills. When in a state of high arousal through chasing and tugging, your dog can practice listening to you and cooling off quickly. That means dropping the toy and lying down when you ask them to. Doing this before you go out is a great option because it helps them relax and expel some anxiety.\nMental enrichment lowers stress levels and keeps dogs from getting bored and starting unwanted behaviors at home. Animate (social interaction) and inanimate (toys, puzzles,scent work) enrichment might even prevent certain behaviors that have already presented from getting worse.\nCue theSchoolhouse Rock!because learning can be fun.\nYou can keep your dog from getting bored with the help oftoys, but it is really important to rotate them. Dogs will lose interest in the same toy after a short period of time — dogs are very similar to kids that way. Start by putting toys away after youplay together, and only offer your dog two or three at a time. Leave them around for a couple of days before removing them and replacing them with something else from the toy box. This will keep the dog interested in the novelty of their toy collection.\nOne of the most popular dog games istug-of-war, and there are somemisconceptionsabout whether or not the dog should ever “win” the game. Research does not show that dogs become more pushy or aggressive when allowed to play tug and win. But, if your dog has already shown a tendency to want to control items by growling or snapping, it is probably not a game to play with them. Some dogs are simply not interested in tugging, and that’s fine, too.\nScatter your dog’s food in the yard or around the house instead of feeding them from a bowl, encouraging more time eating and exercising natural feeding behaviors. You can help your dog by pointing to the place where thefood is hidden. Assuming the dogs don’t have resource-guarding issues, scattering food may also work well in multi-dog households; dogs have shown they are able to communicate information about hidden resources to other dogs.\nDon’t hit pause on your pet’s playtime – these solo activities will help 9-5 fly by for them.\nMusic can be used as sensory enrichment. Classicalmusicfor companion animals have even been developed because, although the mechanism underlying this effect is not well understood, studies show that classical music reduces stress levels and increases resting and sleeping in dogs.\nAuditory stimuli may be enriching, but its use depends on how your dog reacts to it. The sound should not be on all the time because even pets need a break from noise, and volume should be kept low. Most importantly, the sound should be tailored to the needs of your dog as much as possible. Many sounds that are pleasant to humans may be displeasing or distressful to dogs. Most of the time, a selection of gentle classical music, soft pop or call-in radio shows will do the trick of keeping your dog in good company, stimulating their senses and lowering stress levels.\nIn addition to the stimulation that a dog gets from interacting with a toy,chewingreleases feel-good chemicals in the brain, which keeps dogs happy, busy, and using up energy. Chewing is a tool that dogs have at their disposal to self-medicate for anxiety, boredom and/or stress and can produce a sense of euphoria and calmness.\nToys to Keep Dogs Busy\nWhat toys are best for bored dogs? There are plenty to choose from butchoosing toyscan be tricky: Always select the correct size because an item that is too small can lodge in the dog’s throat or be swallowed. Check for small parts that can be chewed off and become choking hazards or create blockages in the intestines. When introducing a new toy, supervise the dog’s initial interactions and check the toy periodically to make sure it’s still in safe shape. An additional warning — some dogs can become protective of toys and even aggressive. If that happens, reach out to a qualified behaviorist to deal with the situation. So they don’t chew on your belongings, here’s a list of solitary toys that’ll keep your pup entertained:\nChews, such as pig ears, bully sticks, and dental bones. Look for all-natural chews made in the United States, size the chew to the dog, keep an eye on the dog while they’re chewing, and dispose of the chew when it’s small enough to be swallowed.\nTwo experts—a veterinary dentist and internist—rate the most popular dog bones.\nFood-dispensingballsare probably the most useful group of toys for solitary play. The dog rolls them around to release food. There are also balls that need to be chewed and manipulated, such as the Everlasting Treat Ball and the Orka ball.\nBehaviorist Karen London shares her list of must-have toys for dogs.\nFood pyramids and cubes, such asKong, Squirrel Dude, and Buster Cubes. During the summer months, freeze a Kong stuffed with wet dog food, pieces of meat floating in stock, or vegetables covered with some water. (A word of advice: make sure you seal the Kong’s openings with some cheese and place it in a Ziploc bag to keep it separate from other foods in the freezer.) Puppies, who usually need additional entertainment and appropriate direction when it comes to chewing, can be fed their entire meal with these toys.\nTwo words: Endless entertainment.\nPuzzlesfrom Nina Ottosson and the Aikiou brands are great for your bright and active puppy. If your dog needs encouragement, make the toys more appealing by rubbing something tasty on them, such aspeanut butter. When you first introduce your dog to these toys, make it easy for them to obtain the treats, then gradually increase the difficulty so that your dog learns how to work persistently to extract the food. Otherwise, your dog may get frustrated, leading to the opposite of what we intend to do through enrichment and stimulation.\nLet the games begin.\nNo need to spend zillions on toys — you can make them yourself. Nest different-sized cardboard boxes, with all staples and tape removed, inside each other, then put a treat in the smallest box. Or use a solid cardboard tube with a few holes to turn it into an exciting food dispenser. Try hiding dry food inside toilet paper tubes, egg cartons, boxes from cereals, and so forth.\nTips for pet parents who want their pups to have safe fun.\nWhy Do Dogs Get Bored?\nWhen a dog gets tired of a certain repeated activity, that’s called habituation. Research has shown that introducing novel activities will keep them engaged with play. In one of these studies, a bacon-bubble machine and a playhouse resulted in the greatest behavior changes. These were both new activities for the dogs in the study, but a bubble machine that smells like bacon would be interesting to anyone.\nThe liquid bubbles pups are obsessed with.\nAs with anything in this life, too much or too little will not do the trick. Beware of overstimulation. While stimulating your dog mentally and physically is the goal, overstimulation may increasestress levels. Think of a ball-obsessed dog, such as a Border Collie, bringing their favorite toy and dropping it at their person’s feet over and over again with no off-button. Individual preferences and circumstances must be kept in mind. Spend time identifying things that your dog finds motivating or reinforcing, and adjust playtime routines before your dog reaches a frustration level.",

    "title": "A Tail-Wagging Dog Isn’t Always a Happy Dog",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/what-wagging-tail-really-means"
  },
  "page_content": "If you were asked to imagine a dog with a wildly wagging tail, you’d probably guess that dog is pretty happy, right? Well, maybe. It’s true that friendly dogs tend to wag their tails, but — prepare for your mind to be blown — that doesn’t mean a wagging tail is a sure sign of friendliness. In fact, lots of dogs wag their tails when they aren’t actually in the best mood, and this misconception can lead people to believe it’s OK to interact with the pup when it actually might not be. Spoiler: Tail wags are more complicated than you might think.\nThe Meaning Behind the Wag\nSo, whatdoesa tail wag mean? The most accurate interpretation is that the dog is willing to interact. The thing is, “interact” is a very broad term. Friendly dogs who want to interact by greeting, playing, or snuggling wag their tails, but so do dogs who want to interact by fighting,biting, and threatening. The simple observation that a dog is wagging their tail doesn’t give you enough information to determine what kind of interaction the dog has in mind.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhen your dog growls, they’re expressing their emotions. A study found that you’ll likely be able to understand what they’re feeling.\nDon’t freak out, though: Observing details of the tail-wagging behavior allows you to make a much better prediction about what’s behind it (no pun intended). To determine if that tail wag is a friendly one, pay attention to how much of the tail and the body are involved in the wag, how fast and how far the tail is wagging, and how much tension is in the tail.\nGenerally, the more the wag encompasses the whole body, the friendlier the dog’s intentions. The full-body wag that extends from the shoulders through the belly to the hips and the tail is the classic, friendly tail wag. An active tail wag that gets the hips swinging is also a likely sign of high sociability. (Bonus: These wags can even be recognized in dogs who have no tails to speak of!) When just the tail moves, the wag may or may not have anything to do with being sociable. When only the tip of the tail moves, the dog is most likely not friendly.\nHow to make sense of all those grunts and whines.\nAnother way that dogs give us information about what the wag means isspeed. Fast wags that move through a big arc are associated with friendliness, while a slow wag that doesn’t move the tail much is a sign of an...absence of friendliness. Sometimes, dogs who are a littlenervous, or maybereserved, wag slowly, which simply shows some hesitancy about interacting. In other cases, a slow tail wag can signify aggressive tendencies.\nTension is another revealing attribute: A stiff tail wag is not a good sign. The more relaxed a tail is while it is wagging, the more likely it is that the dog is friendly. A flexible, fluid motion in the tail suggests friendliness; a rigid tail does not.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nSometimes a dog wags their tail in a rotating motion that starts from the base, with the tip of the tail tracing a broad circle. Known as a “circle wag,” it is one of the positive signals that experienced dog handlers watch for when evaluating dogs because it is so strongly associated with dogs who are in a friendly mood. Also called the “propeller wag” or “helicopter tail,” this tail motion is particularly common in dogs who are greeting a close friend, especially after a long absence.\nTo sum up, the friendliest type of tail wag is the full-body wag with a rapidly moving, flexible tail swinging widely from side to side. In contrast, the least friendly tail wag, and the one of most concern in terms of potential aggression, is the slow twitch of only the tip on an otherwise unmoving, rigid tail attached to an equally stiff body. This unfriendly tail wag is frequently displayed prior to a bite.\nA wagging tail indicates an interest in interacting, but the details of the wag reveal its meaning. Pay careful attention to the specifics of a tail wag to discern its significance. Friendly dogs want to interact, and their tail wags show that. But, remember, there are unfriendly ways of interacting, including biting, and dogs with those intentions also wag their tails.",

Is it due to the constant attention you gave them in the first month, even if it did cost youallyour vacation time? Is it good genes that deserve the credit? And if your dog has some serious issues — extreme fear,high reactivity,a tendency touse their mouthon everything from your arms to the furniture to the laundry in the basket — is it because you skipped some puppy walks when the weather was bad? Do those behaviors come from early trauma that happened before you adopted them? Do genes deserve the blame for these issues?\nOh, how we all want the answers to these questions. I mean, what dog parents wouldn’t give just about anything to know what makes their dogs who they are? The short answer to the question about what makes dogs who they are is that there are a lot of factors, and the full answer is a long story about the many variables that influence who our dogs are and what they do.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nDog DNA and Behavior: What It All Means\nScientific research continues to explore those variables, and arecent articlein the journalFrontiers in Psychologypoints to the chemicals that are attached to the dog’s DNA as one factor that explains differences in behavior between dogs. That’s interesting because it isnotthe genes themselves (the dog’s genome) that the researchers looked at, but rather at the dogs’ “epigenome.”\nThe epigenome is the full set of modifications that regulate the expression and activity of genes, and that includes chemicals attached to their DNA. These chemicals are not the DNA (the dog’s genetics) itself. They are chemicals that are acquired by each dog during development and during their life, but not inherited from their parents. The unique set of chemical tags hanging on to each dog’s DNA makes up their epigenome, and it has a huge effect on the dog. In this study, researchers looked specifically at methylation, which involves the attachment of methyl groups (one carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms) to DNA. Interestingly, methylation can be affected by the environment, especially by pollution and toxins.\nIt’s important to remember that dogs are individuals, so training isn’t one-size-fits-all.\nMethylation may sound trivial, but it can influence all kinds of things, such as the production of neurotransmitters, metabolism of fats and other substances, eye and liver health, cellular energy, and detoxification — all of which can affect behavior. The reason for the strong influence on all kinds of physical and behavioral traits is that methylation affects which genes are “turned on and off” or expressed.\nThe Epigenetics of It All\nSo, while the epigenome is not the dog’s genes, the epigenome influences the expression of those genes. The association of variation in DNA methylation and behavioral traits suggests that differences in theexpressionof genes may contribute to certain canine behaviors. But this is not the same thing at all as thepresenceof certain genes being responsible.\nBased on chemical analyses and surveys by pet parents in the current study, we know that methylation is associated with energy levels of dogs and on the fearful behavior they show towards strangers. There is still more research to be done on the additional aspects of behaviors that are affected by dogs’ epigenetics.\nNot all fearful dogs have been mistreated.\nEpigenetics has been described as the system by which experience influences the activities of our genes and also as the last nail in the coffin of genetic determinism. In other words, even though genes influence who dogs become, genesalonedo not determine their behavior, and the genes do not trap them into a particular way of being.\nThe researchers summarize the importance of their research by writing: “In conclusion, we propose that energy and stranger-directed fear are partially predictable by DNA methylation in dogs. These behavioral associations are of interest because they provide evidence that changes in methylation can impact personalities, energy levels, and other aspects of behavior. Since methylation is dynamic and can be influenced by environmental factors, in the future we might be able to modify canine behavior by modulating these factors.”\nEverything you need to know to get your new addition off to a good start.\nScience-speak aside, we all want to know why our dogs are who they are. Every dog is different in their personality, behavior, and temperament. Future studies of epigenetics may help us learn more about why dogs act as they do, allow us to screen dogs for suitability as service dogs or for temperament generally, and modify behavior by actively targeting methylation.",

  "page_content": "In my time as a trainer, I’ve seen dogs who give their pet-parent constant attention, dogs who couldn’t seem to care less, and dogs who learned over time to focus in on their guardian on cue. A pup’s focus is unpredictable: Some naturally attentive dogs are clingy and some are social butterflies who are just drawn to people. Still others are a bitpossessive, treating their guardians as though they are the best bones in the world and need constant attention to maintain their safety. While these traits can be modified, they cannot be created out of thin air or fundamentally changed. Dogs either have this behavioral tendency or they don’t.\nFew dogs are as naturally attentive as most of us wish; if yours isn’t, don’t feel bad or wonder what you did wrong. Your dog, like most dogs, just isn’t built that way. For some guardians, that’s a good thing. Plenty of people prefer pups with their own interests who can amuse themselves and aren’t staring at them expectantly, waiting to be entertained. But it’s important to be able to get your dog’s attention, too. Luckily, even inattentive pups can learn to respond to cues.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nBuilding Stronger Relationships\nThe strength of your relationship has an impact on your dog’s attentiveness. If you have consistently been a source of what makes your dog happy, attention is a likely side effect. If you have a love between the two of you and a strong history of fun together, your dog might be more likely to feel motivated to pay attention to you in any given moment.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nWhile a good relationship can help with attention issues, it won’t necessarily guarantee a high level of attentiveness. It won’t. It’s just one piece of the puzzle, and if your dog is not highly attentive in all situations, it certainly doesn’t mean that the relationship is flawed or in any way lacking. It just means that, for whatever reason, your dog is focusing on other aspects of the environment.\nMany people find that their dogs are so engrossed in what’s around them and all its wonderfulsmellsthat getting them to pay attention outdoors feels like swimming upstream. Though such “nose to the ground” dogs are indeed among the most challenging when it comes to working on attentiveness, many of them are actually paying attention to their people without obvious signs of doing so. It’s common for those with dogs who are particularly responsive to the environment to note that their dogs always know where they are when they’re out and about. But the dogs’ top priority in that context isn’t interacting with people; it’s interacting with the environment. They tend to show their affiliation in other ways at other times, and that’s where the strength of the relationship is more obvious to the casual observer.\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nMany factors affect your relationship, including your respective personalities and your interactions over time. If your dog associates you withtreats, enjoyable training,massages, outings,toys,and games, you’re more likely to have their attention. In the best of relationships, there’s also an intangible quality: some individuals hit it off in an indefinable, magical way.Strong bonds of loveare often made of those special and inexplicable connections. If a relationship is damaged or not very strong, the dog may give more attention to someone else.\nPutting Attention On Cue\n“My dog pays me no mind when they’re outside off leash.” “My dog is always blowing me off.” “They know they’re supposed to listen to me, but they ignore me if anything else is going on.” These are all common complaints from people struggling with getting their dogs to pay attention on cue.\nThe problem many of us have with adog who is not responsive to cues, especially outside, is not so much a matter of devotion but of training. For most dogs, learning a “pay attention” cue in the face of a whole world of wonder is essentially a difficult, high-level trick and must be taught as such. Yes, some dogs learn this quickly and thoroughly without too much trouble, but that’s unusual. For most dogs, expect top-quality responses only after consistent, long-term training efforts.\nIn the larger scheme of things, a cue to pay attention is essential because it is the basis of all training. You can teach a dog just about anything if you have their attention, but it’s virtually impossible if you don’t. Asking for a dog’s attention is a top priority for professional trainers, which is why it is often the first skill taught in classes or private lessons.\nWhen it’s time to call in reinforcements.\nThis is especially valuable for dogs who don’t frequently offer their attention spontaneously. Teaching dogs to give attention when they don’t consistently offer it on their own requires more time and effort because you have to teach the behavior and associate it with a cue.\nEffective Attention Training Behaviors\nThe two most common cues for attention are “watch” and the dog’s name. “Watch” tells a dog to look at your face, and it’s a great way to keep a dog from paying attention to things that cause them to act in an undesirable way. Saying the dog’s name lets them know that they should pay attention to you and wait for more information.\nOnce you have your dog’s attention, it’s easier for them to respond to other cues, including “down,” “stay” and “come,” or simply to follow you in a new direction on a walk. It’s important to reinforce these behaviors so your dog’s glad they did what you asked. If they learn that they’ll receive atreator have a chance to play for giving you their attention in response to the cue “watch” or to their name, they will be more likely to give you their attention when asked in the future.\nIf your dog tries to scarf down literally everything in sight, youneedthis advice.\nPaying attention will be easier for your dog in some contexts than in others. Typically, dogs are more likely to pay attention inside than outside, and when there are no distractions — no squirrels or smells of food or other interesting things in the air. Like any other skill, giving attention on cue requires practice and takes time to teach. Gradually working toward giving attention in increasingly challenging environments is a good strategy. Improving the relationship so that the dog is more inclined to pay attention will also improve your dog’s responsiveness to you.\nMore Trainer Tricks\nIdeally, dogs keep track of where their human is. It’s a sign of maturity to be able to sniff in the grass, romp with a canine buddy, and still occasionally check in. Although dogs with certain natural tendencies are more likely to do this, others can be trained to act the same way.\nWhen I’m teaching dogs to exhibit this behavior, I do it in places that allow them to be safelyoff leash, where they can wander and sniff to their hearts’ content. When the dog is in their own world and not attending to me at all, I position myself so that I can see the dog, but they can’t see me. When they look up and seem just a little concerned, I call them to come, reinforcing them for their successful search. (If the dog becomes stressed, I come out of my hiding spot so they can see me and still reinforce them for coming to me.)\nThe most mouth-watering treats for training your pup.\nThis is a good way to perfect recalls and teach your dog that it’s wise to keep track of you, but it only works with dogs who are connected enough to care when they think for a moment that their human is lost. It is not helpful with aloof dogs or those who are completely unperturbed by your absence, and it’s just cruel to disappear on a clingy, nervous dog. Reserve this technique for those who are stable enough to handle your absence and connected enough to care — which, fortunately, is the majority of dogs.\nRemember, when we talk about our dogs paying attention to us, we are really talking about two things: spontaneous attention and attention given on cue. There are many ways to improve both kinds of attentiveness, but that doesn’t mean you can change a dog’s essential nature. All the training in the world isn’t going to turn an aloof and independent dog or a dog who is wildly distracted by the smells of the great outdoors into one who is compulsive about checking in. But it is possible to teach any dog to respond properly to the cue “watch” and to their name and to come when called.\nIt’s also possible, and desirable, to strengthen your relationship with your dog to increase their attentiveness to you. The more fun and satisfying your interactions are, the more likely your dog is to give you their attention spontaneously or on cue.",

  "page_content": "Dogs are extraordinarily flexible creatures — how else could they live in our homes with us, learn towalk on a leash, and tag along onroad trips? That said, there are a few ways that evolution hasn’t equipped pups for the challenges of living in our world. From watching TV to hugging, here are some of the things we do that dogs just don’t understand.\n1. We leave them alone\nAs born socialites, dogs make friends easily. Puppies are intensely interested in spending time with other dogs, people, and any species willing to interact with them socially. They usually play,rest, explore, andtravelwith company. Yet we often leave dogs alone: at home, in kennels, or at the vet. Young dogs can’t be sure we’ll ever return to get them. Only after experience are they likely to expect a reunion, and even then, their experience depends on the context.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nAt home, we may try to enforce dog-free zones. Naturally, many dogs protest. How can they stay with their (human) social group when they’re separated behind impenetrable barriers (doors)? This explains why dogs so often demand to be let inside when their human family is there, and why those withseparation-relateddistress frequently find some solace in being indoors.\nTrain your dog to stay calm when they’re on their own — instead of sad-singing“All By Myself”until you come home.\n2. We watch TV\nDogs live in an olfactory world, while ours is chiefly visual. So, while TVs may offer a visual feast for humans, parks and beaches are an olfactory banquet for dogs. An additional challenge is dogs move while investigating the world, whereas we often sit still. They may not relish the inertia we enjoy in front of a noisy, flashing light-box.\nIsAnimal Planetreally their favorite channel?\n3. We change our smell and shape\nShoes, coats, wallets, briefcases, bags, and suitcases: countless smells cling to these items after we take them into shops and workplaces, then back to our dogs. Cleaning products, soaps, deodorants, and shampoos also change the scents our dogs are used to.\nTowels, hats, and bags change our shape when we’re using them. And when we’re pulling them on, jumpers and coats alter our visual outline and may catch dogs off-guard. Dogs change their coats at least once a year. In contrast, we change our external wear every day. This means the odors we carry are changing far more than dogs have evolved to expect. In their olfactory world, it must be puzzling for dogs to encounter our constantly changing smells, especially for a species that uses scent to identify familiar individuals and intruders.\nResearch finds that your pup can smell when you’ve been doom-scrolling, and they get bummed out.\n4. We like to hug\nHow humans use their forelimbs contrasts sharply with how dogs do. We may use them to carry large objects a dog would have to drag, but also to grasp each other and express affection. Dogs grasp each other loosely when play-wrestling, and also when mating and fighting. Being pinned by another dog prevents a quick escape. How are puppies to know what a hug from a human means, when that behavior from a dog might be threatening?\nBoundaries, folks. Boundaries.\n5. We don’t like to be bitten\nPlay-fighting is fun for many puppies and helps them bond with other dogs. But they must monitor the behavior of other dogs in play-fights and know when they’ve used their tiny, razor-sharp teeth excessively. Humans are much more susceptible to pain from playful puppy jaws than other dogs are, and so we may react negatively to their attempts to play-fight with us.\nDogs interact with objects almost entirely with their muzzle. And to feed, they use their jaws, teeth, and tongue. Dogs also “mouth” other dogs when playing, expressing affection and communicating everything from “more” to “please don’t” to “Back off!” So, naturally, they try to use their mouths when communicating with us and must be puzzled by how often we take offense.\nHow to teach your pup to play nice.\n6. We don’t eat food from the trash\nDogs are opportunists who naturally acquire food anywhere they find it. In contrast, we present them with food in dishes of their own. Puppies must be puzzled by our reaction when we find them snacking from benches and tables, in lunchboxes, and kitchen trash cans. We shouldn’t be surprised when dogs unearth food we left somewhere accessible to them.\nIf your dog tries to scarf down literally everything in sight, youneedthis advice.\n7. We share territories\nWe visit the territories of other dogs, bringing back their smells, and we allow unfamiliar human and canine visitors to enter our dogs’ home. Dogs have not evolved to accept such intrusions and threats to their safety and resources. So we shouldn’t be surprised when our dogs treat visitors with suspicion, or when our dogs are treated with hostility when we bring them to the homes of others.\nBecause nobody wants your pup eating the host’s charcuterie platter.\n8. We use our hands a lot\nSometimes our hands deliver food, scratches,massages, and toys. Other times, they restrain dogs,trim nails, administer ointments or tablets, and groom with brushes and combs that may pull hair. No wonder some dogs grow to fear the human hand as it moves about them. We can make it easier for dogs to accept many types of hand-related activities if we train them to cooperate with rewards.",

  },
  "page_content": "A friend once told me that, for dogs, sniffing an especially odorous patch of grass is akin to what humans experience when we listen to a great symphony. They are transfixed by the opening scent sonata of earthiness, moved by the petrichor adagio of rainfall, thrilled by the cheeky minuet of another dog’s urine.\nGiven that this comparison was made at a party and hedged with statements like “I definitely read it somewhere…. I don’t remember where….” I’d take it with a grain of salt. But there’s no denying dogs love to sniff. (Especially, it seems, when we’re trying to hurry them along on a walk.) While we tend to think of food, exercise, wellness, and socialization as key to our pup’s wellbeing, we often don’t think about the benefits that can be had by letting them just follow their nose.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nEnter the scent walk. Also known as a  “smell walk,” a “sniff walk,” a “decompression walk,” or, as certified professional behaviorist and trainer Karen London calls it, a “sniffari,” the premise is simple: Take your dog on a leisurely walk and let them sniff whatever catches their fancy.\nA “sniffari” gives your dog a chance to be the boss.\n“Just for the quality of life of the dog, it’s tremendous,” saysRobert Haussmann, a member of Kinship’s Expert Collective and the certified professional dog trainer and behaviorist who foundedDogboy NYC.\nHere’s what to know about why scent walks are so beneficial — and how you can incorporate them into your routine.\nDogs Are Built to Smell\nDogs have been trained to sniff out bombs, money, drugs, avalanche survivors, even certain illnesses. But even a little couch-potato pup is equipped with a wildly advanced smelling apparatus. According to theAmerican Kennel Club, roughly one-eighth of a dog’s brain is dedicated to interpreting odors. That’s 40 times more mental real estate dedicated to smelling than humans.\nThere’s no time like the present, according to your pet.\nBy making time for your dog to take in different smells, you’re making time for them to do the thing they were built to do. And that, Haussmann says, can be invaluable for maintaining a dog’s wellbeing.\n“How exactly is it enriching?” he says. “How is it enriching to expose a child to music, or art? The brain is designed for creativity. Humans are creators and builders, and dogs are sniffers.”\nAll Dogs Will Love Scent Walks\nHow do you know if your dog would benefit from a scent walk? The simple answer: If they’re a dog. Haussmann says he’s recommended the practice to a variety of clients. “It could be something that’s an ancillary support to any kind of behavior therapy you might be doing for anxious dogs or dogs who have a misplaced or overactive drive of one kind or another. For any old dog, it’s a great way to engage this superpower that we barely comprehend.”\nHaussmann says he especially likes recommending scent walks to clients with older dogs who might not have the same physical stamina or ability to enjoy long hikes or boisterous visits to the park. He used to take his own beloved late dog Max on scent walks, even after Max started developingdog dementiaand losing some of his faculties. “We would spend a lot of time letting him stick his nose in dirt and really have at it, just because I was like,What’s he got going on?I felt it was something I could do for him.”\nWhich one is yours?\nTake Scent Walks Whenever You Want\nThere’s no wrong way to do a scent walk. As long as you’re letting your dog get in some good sniffs, you’re doing a scent walk. You could set aside some time in the evening to take your dog on a smell tour of the neighborhood, or you could tack on 10 minutes just for sniffing at the end of your regular walk — whatever works best for you, your dog, and your schedule. Even if you have ayardthat your dog enjoys inspecting, it’s still worth taking them on a walk around the block so they can take in the sights, sounds, and smells.\nHaussmann cautions that some dogs are too ramped up in the mornings to do a contemplative scent walk. If that’s the case, just find a better time. “I usually say an evening walk might be a nice time. It’s not crazy busy, there’s not a ton of people and dogs out. Maybe you can just stroll around for a bit and let them explore.”\nOr Take It Inside\nAs anyone who has dragged their unhappy dog along a cold, rainy sidewalk knows, nature doesn’t always allow for leisurely walks. When the weather doesn’t permit, you can still help your dog flex their sniffing muscles by setting up some easy smelling tasksinside. Haussmann recommends having your dog stay in a different room, and then hiding bits of their food around your space for them to scavenge for.\n“You’re feeding the dog twice a day anyway,” Haussmann said. “You might as well make five minutes of that a fun game for them.”",

  "page_content": "Much like with people, you can’t just put any two dogs together and expect them to strike up a friendship like they’re the main characters inStep Brothers(2008). Even if you think a pair of dogs would play great together, ultimately, the dogs will decide if they’re going to beBFFs— or just tolerate each other. That said, if you check off these seven compatibility points, the two pups could be doing the dog equivalent of turning their beds into bunk beds (“more room for activities!”) in no time.\n1. Do they have compatible play styles?\nSure, most dogs love to play, but they may not play the same way. Some dogs love to play chase, running back and forth with one another endlessly, while others engage in rough-and-tumblewrestle play. Then, there are those more interested in playing stalking games. Some dogs are much calmer in their play, preferring to gently bat at each other with their paws or bounce around near each other, while others slam into one another, both while running or wrestling in place.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nNo one play style is any better than another, but the dogs need to be compatible. They don’t necessarily need to have the same favorite play style as long as there’s one they mutually enjoy. What you don’t want is one dog trying to play chase while the other dog is trying to wrestle. Play sessions only go well if the playmates are trying to play the same game and both are enjoying it.\n2. Are their sizes a reasonable match?\nDogs certainly don’t have to be the same size to be great friends and play buddies, but there are some advantages to being in the same general range. When dogs are well-matched in size, there is less chance of injuries. It may also make it easier for the dogs to play without one having to take it easy on a much smaller play partner. Dogs who are similar in size can play without having to hold back.\nTwo animal behavior experts agree it’s usuallyplay fighting. Here’s how you can tell.\nThat said, some of the best dog friends in the world are wildly different in size, with the bigger dog being an expert at matching the smaller dog’s level. It’s cute to watch a huge dog play with a small dog while lying down — as long as both dogs are having fun and not putting each other at risk.\n3. How old are they?\nDogs don’t need to be the same age, or even close in age, to have a great time playing together, but age is still a consideration. Compatibility in exuberance, persistence, and energy levels is always a plus, and age influences those factors. The biggest issue with dogs of very different ages is that younger dogs often want to play much longer, even after an older dog has had enough. It’s not unusual for an old dog to be excited about playing — for a few minutes, at least.\nPairing a senior dog with a youngster who wants to play morning, noon, and night can lead to problems. At a minimum, the young dog may become sad and disappointed, perhaps even tentative about initiating future play with the older dog. Or worse, the younger dog may refuse to give up, upsetting the older dog, who may become aggressive in order to let the pesky, persistent younger dog know they’rebeing rude. Many pairs of dogs of mixed ages get along beautifully, but it’s essential to protect a senior from ayoungsterwho won’t take no for an answer.\nDon’t worry; it’s just a phase!\n4. Do both pet parents have similar views about play?\nA good play session between dogs isn’t just about the dogs; pet parents also play a role in its success. There are decisions to be made when dogs play together, and it’s best if both people feel the same way about them. Is it OK iftreatsare available? How about toys? Are both of you in agreement about what constitutesappropriate play? What sorts of behaviors by the dogs will prompt you (or them) to intervene and require the dogs to take a break? Will you both pay attention and monitor the play, or does the other person feel that ignoring the dogs is a better strategy? Or worse, do they think dogs need to “work it out themselves”?\n5. Does the other dog play nicely?\nSome dogs can playexuberantlyand with great energy, but if both dogs are willing participants who are having a good time, that’s a good sign. If, on the other hand, your dog finds the other dog scary or overwhelming, that’s not OK. Dogs who are relentless, pushy, or rude are not playing nicely, and they don’t make the best play buddies. Even if your pup isn’t frightened, it makes sense to protect them from bad-mannered play. Not only can it lead to situations that are not fun, but it can also teach a dog that such behavior is an acceptable way to play.\n6. Does the other dog have bad habits you don’t want your dog to pick up?\nAs social animals, dogs do learn from one another, including during play. Like children who act out after spending time with an unruly friend, dogs also pick up bad habits from other dogs. Such contagious behavior can include barking at passersby, running along afence growlingand lunging at a dog on the other side,digging, andhowling. Sometimes, people are quick to assume that their young dog picked up an unfortunate behavior from a play buddy when the dog likely developed those behaviors on their own. But there’s no doubt that dogs can acquire unfortunate habits from other dogs, so choosing play buddies who don’t exhibit these behaviors is a wise idea.\nNew kid on the block? Follow this trainer’s tips before letting your pet run wild.\n7. Does your dog like the other dog?\nIs the other dog one your dog is interested in and wants to play with? The heart wants what the heart wants, and one of the best reasons to choose a play buddy for your dog is that your dog loves the other dog. As long as there are no red flags, why not choose to have play dates with the dog that makes your dog the happiest and most eager to play?\nSafety reminder:\nCollars(and, to a lesser degree,harnesses) can be trouble for actively playing dogs. Teeth and buckles get caught or tags twist together, and before you know it, both dogs are freaking out — unable to separate. They can hurt themselves or the other dog in their struggle. You can reduce the risk by simply removing collars at playtime.",

The pair would romp and run and sometimes just sit next to each other and take in the view of the play area. We had another dog at home, Cleo, and while Lorenzo seemed to love her, she didn’t inspire the same ardent passion in him that Mango did. “She’s his best friend!” the people at daycare would say. Do dogs really have “best friends,” though?\n“I can tell you that over my years of training, I have seen dogs build bonds with other dogs that are greater than even [the bonds they have with] a dog they live with,” saysLarry Benoit, a longtime dog trainer in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. And they don’t just build these bonds with other dogs, he adds. “I’ve seen them do it with donkeys, cattle, sheep. Even birds.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nIt’s tempting to anthropomorphize our pups.Idefinitely did when I asked Lorenzo if Mango was really his best friend, if they shared secrets, and if they planned to get matching tattoos someday. But while animal bonds and human friendships may be different, there’s no denying that a species as highly sociable as dogs benefits from close relationships. Below, what we know about how dogs make friends, how it can boost their health, and how we, as their parents, can help enrich their social lives.\nIn case you’ve ever wondered what it’s like to live in a dog society.\nDog “Friendships” Are Different Than Ours\nScientists have been working for years to address questions about play and other social behaviors in dogs. Along the way, they have documented, on tape and in notes, a number of striking canine friendships and how they're different from a casual dog park encounter.\nIn a 2012cover storyforTimemagazine, science journalist Carl Zimmer wrote about how different species form friendships, and found that, though dogs form “friendship-type” relationships with other dogs in their home, and have “preferred canine companions,” most scientists think that these “fall well short of true friendship.”\nIn his story, Zimmer explains that scientists had noted “the lack of evidence in dogs of the constancy, reciprocity and mutual defense observed in species such as chimpanzees and dolphins.” He concludes: “Dogs are neither our best friends nor one another’s — which is not to say they’re not warm and wonderful companions.”\nBut TheyAreDrawn to Good Vibes\nEven if their closest relationships can’t really be qualified as “friendships,” it’s clear that our pups are more drawn to some dogs than to others. In that way, they’re a lot like people: Sometimes, you meet someone with whom you immediately click, and other times, you meet someone who immediately makes you want to bare your teeth.\n“I’m a firm believer that dogs operate off of energy,” Benoit says. “It is an energy from another dog or even another species that would enable them to gravitate towards that. It’s the one-on-one that they give and take with each other.”\nBenoit says he’s conducted group-training sessions where two dogs take a liking to each other, and before you know it, “they could care less about the five or six other dogs in the room.” There’s still so much communication between dogs that is invisible to the human eye. But there are signs that dogs are bonding: if they play together, snuggle together, and generally stay close to each other when they’re together.\nEverything you need to keep your pup safe and engaged (so you can focus on that Zoom meeting).\nDogs Are More Like Pack Members\nIf your family and family pets are your dog’s primary pack, friends they see regularly become extended pack members. In other words, they are not primary cast members in each other’s lives but featured players. “Just like you have extended family members, like nieces and nephews who don’t live with you in the home,” Benoit explains.  These relationships can still be close enough thatdogs will grieve the lossof their friend or come to their aid if they sense they’re in danger.\nIf dogs can have best friends, does this detract from our relationships with them?“The answer is a definite “no,” says Smuts and Ward. “They still seek us out and adore our company as much as ever. It doesn’t have to be one or the other. Dogs can have dog friends and still be close to their people. Access to dog friends makes dogs happier, and happier dogs make for better human companions.”\nBenefits of Friendship Between Dogs\nCountless studies have shown that friendshipscan help strengthena person’s mental and physical well-being. Although there aren’t many similar studies concerning dogs, Benoit says he believes close bonds can help dogs lead better, more fulfilling lives: “It might even possibly help them live longer because a dog that just lays around bored and does nothing or has no other dogs to play with is susceptible to a shorter life than a dog who does have pack members and extended pack members.”\nThe benefits can be real for any two dogs who enjoy each other’s company. “They often visit each other’s homes. This can offer a great alternative to a kennel or leaving a dog home alone all day. While together, they tire each other out and stimulate each other’s bodies and minds,” says Barbara Smuts, PhD, and Camille Ward, PhD, in their article on dog friendships. “Friends can provide much-needed stability when change threatens a dog’s equilibrium,” such as when a housemate passes away.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a shy pup to go from wallflower to social butterfly.\nSocialize, Socialize, Socialize\nThe key to setting your dog up for success, Benoit argues, is proper socialization. Ideally, this takes place during the critical development period of three to 16 weeks of age. By gently introducing your puppy to different dogs, people, and experiences during this time, you’ll reduce the likelihood that they’ll be fearful of new dogs, people, and experiences as they get older.\nCan a dog’s social needs be met through dog parks or dog daycare? “For some dogs — the confident extroverts — perhaps, but others are more shy, and, as they age, many dogs lose interest in the company of exuberant youngsters. There also exist dogs who don’t get along well with most other dogs, but who can be friends with a special someone,” says Smuts and Ward.\nSay you adopted your dog as an adult, and they’re kind of shy. You can still help them socialize and meet potential friends by trying out a variety ofdog parksand dog meet-ups and observing the environments when/wherethey seem to have fun and feel comfortable.\nBenoit says that when you do, keep an eye on the other dogs or other dog park regulars who can become territorial or dominant. If that’s the case, it may not be the best space for your dog, and you should try somewhere else.\nBenoit also notes that you should never try to force a friendship on your dog. “I allow them to respond to other dogs and reject other dogs,” he says. In fairness, you probably wouldn’t respond well to a friendship your parents tried to force upon you, either.",

  "page_content": "Your dog does something every day that pretty much convinces you they’re human. They sigh when they (allegedly) feel the weight of the world on their shoulders. Theycry happy tears(really!). Theyget sadand need a day of watching rom-coms and snuggling. Dogs are the same as humans in a lot of ways — including the fact that they also have personalities. So, yes, that means when you tell your pup how special and unique they are, you’re...right. As it turns out, science is exploring character variations in dogs, too. Here’s what the research tells us.\nDo Dogs Really Have Unique Personalities?\nThe name Pavlov probably brings to mind bells and salivating dogs. What you might not know is that early in his studies, Pavlov and his students noticed that dogs differed from one another. Some tended to be nervous and sensitive, some were active and lively, and some were quiet and steady. Pavlov and his team were describing dogs’ personalities.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThe concept of personality can be used to convey that individuals differ in how they perceive and interact with the world around them. The word also describes an individual’s usual pattern of behavior — characteristics that are relatively stable over time and across situations. Say there’s a snowman on the front lawn. Some dogs would walk by as though Frosty had always been there. Others might play-bow and dance joyfully in front of their new friend. A few may freeze, tuck, and retreat.\nIf those same dogs then confront other novel situations — balloons in a tree, a parade, clowns jumping out of a car, you name it — those who perceived Frosty as no bother would probably continue to be indifferent, while those who equated Frosty with Satan would likely be freaked. Although it does not imply that an individual will respond the same exact way every time (dogs are not robots, after all), the term “personality” denotes an individual’susualperceptions or interactions.\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nThinking about personality gets tricky very quickly because there is no universal definition. Some fields distinguish between personality and temperament, while others use the terms interchangeably. As Dr. Samuel Gosling, a personality and social psychologist at the University of Texas, Austin, explains, “Temperament is the basic, biologically inherited tendencies of an individual, and personality is the result of the interaction between temperament and the environment.”\nThat distinction is common in human psychology but is not always made in animal fields. But, as Gosling adds, “Since adult animals are a combination of biologically-inherited tendencies, as well as individual experiences, it seems to me misleading to call that temperament. In humans, we would call that personality, so why not in other animals?”\nMaking a distinction between temperament and personality could enable researchers to explore whether certain traits are more stable over time than others. For example, a recent analysis surveying a number of studies found that in puppies,aggressionand submissiveness were most consistent, while responsiveness to training, sociability, andfearfulnesswere least consistent.\nUnderstanding the relationship between early-life temperaments and later-in-life personalities could be paramount for real-world issues, such as selecting dogs for work or companionship. For working dogs, Gosling and his team advise the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on how to measure personality-trait consistency in order to improve the selection and training of working detector dogs.\nBack home, you might think you have a handle on who your puppy is, but what you’re seeing might or might not relate to their future, adult personality. (So even if your pup starts out apprehensive about the vacuum cleaner, there’s hope for improvement.)\nA new study found that a dog’s breed accounts for less than 10 percent of their behavior.\nAt the same time, many shy away from using the term when it comes to non-human animals, sometimes because they’re uneasy about the “A” word: anthropomorphism (giving human characteristics to an animal or object). To avoid linking dogs and personhood so explicitly, scientists use alternative descriptors such as “behavioral types,” “behavioral syndromes,” and “coping styles.” Regardless of the word employed, when the definitions are compared, they tend to describe the same basic phenomenon: consistent, individual differences in behavioral tendencies over time and across situations.\nMuch of the initial pushback against the term “personality” has dissipated because studies now suggest that personality in non-human animals can be measured and evaluated, just as in humans. (Relatively speaking, this field is in its infancy, and techniques and methodologies continue to evolve, so stay tuned.)\nHow Is a Dog's Personality Evaluated?\nWhile human personality is often assessed by questionnaires, dogs are less adept with that format, tending to provide insufficient responses (mostly, slobber and paw prints). But their inability to hold a pen does not exclude them from questionnaire-based personality assessments; humans can complete questionnaires on their dog's behalf. The method is reliable because independent observers — in this case, dog parents and other humans who know the dog — generally agree in their descriptions of a dog’s personality. This type of consistency is a hallmark of human personality research and lends credibility to the approach. And, even better, similar ratings provided by observers over time further substantiate the utility of particular questionnaires.\nQuestionnaires, however, are not bulletproof. Gosling notes that questionnaires “don’t rule out the possibility that ratings are based on some stereotype, say a physical stereotype, like ‘bigger animals are more aggressive.’ You could still get those biases.” Dogs’ physical appearances are emotion points for humans and make them susceptible to attributions and judgments that might have no bearing on the personality of individuals. For example, the Papillon breed standard specifies that these small dogs are to be “happy, alert, and friendly,” and their physical appearance easily promotes this perception of an overall perkiness. But on an individual basis, just like other dogs, Papillons can be shy (or downright neurotic).\nEven taking into account the risk of stereotyping, questionnaires provide meaningful information about a dog’s personality. When comparing questionnaire ratings with separate behavior observation assessments, a strong link has been found. So if a dog is judged on a questionnaire to be highly timid, independent observers will generally also describe the dog’s behavior in terms consistent withshyness.\nYou won’t live with a rambunctious goofy teenager forever.\nSince people are rarely shy about discussing their dogs, collecting data via questionnaires can be incredibly fruitful. TheCanine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire(C-BARQ), developed by Dr. James Serpell and researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, is a widely used assessment of dog behavioral characteristics (available for public use). The 101 questions gather insights into dogs by asking people to use a five-point scale to describe how their dog would likely react in a variety of different situations, such as anxiety or fear in heavy traffic or when examined by a veterinarian; excited when the doorbell rings orwhen visitors arrive; and of course, likely to chase cats if given the opportunity.\nA recent study of former breeding dogs from commercial breeding operations — commonly referred to as“puppy mills”— relied on the C-BARQ to evaluate the dispositions of these dogs once they’re out in the world. Overall, they were found to be more fearful and nervous than typical pet dogs, particularly regarding strangers and stairs, and many were sensitive about being touched. Despite having lived for years in their adoptive households, many of these dogs still displayed persistent fear and anxiety, which is exactly the type of long-term rather than short-term tendencies that investigations of personality aim to reveal.\nBut do we really need questionnaires when a dog’s actual behavior is right in front of us? Of course, it’s easy to watch a dog and write down how they react to various stimuli, but that’s not necessarily enough. While it’s plausible to observe dog behavior in myriad situations by simply waiting for different scenarios — such as flashing lights and loud sirens — to present themselves, test batteries, which are designed to investigate whether various stimuli and situations elicit particular responses, are more common. For example, the Dog Mentality Assessment (DMA) is a behavior test originating in Sweden that requires dogs to respond to, among other things, novel people, furry objects, loud noises, the potential for play, and people dressed up like ghosts (yep, ghosts).\nThe researchers boiled down dogs’ behavioral responses into five personality dimensions: sociability, playfulness, chase-proneness, aggressiveness, and curiosity/fearfulness. Comparing the results from the DMA test battery with the C-BARQ assessment showed broad agreement between the two.\nYou can think of these personality dimensions as the canine equivalent of the classic human “Big Five” personality models: extroversion (sociable and outgoing), agreeableness (trustworthy and straightforward), neuroticism (anxious, irritable, and shy), openness (curious, imaginative and excitable), and conscientiousness (efficient, thorough, and not lazy). Research groups continue to flesh out the various personality dimensions found in dogs; recently, the Anthrozoology Research Group in Australia generated a slightly different list of attributes, one that included extroversion, neuroticism, motivation, training focus, and amicability.\nHere’s why your pup may get the winter blues, too.\nAs you might imagine, it’s not easy to summarize and sort all of a dog’s behaviors into a small number of buckets, so there is much left to learn in this area. One hot topic that warrants more research is the possible relationships between different traits. For example, are individuals who are more bold also more sociable and playful with strangers? Or is it more challenging to find links between traits? While boldness and aggression correlate in some species, researchers have not found that to be true for dogs. Dogs who were bolder were not necessarily more aggressive. The possibilities for this area of research are virtually endless.\nWhat Will My Dog's Personality Be?\nAt any given moment, chances are that a Beagle’s nose will be pressed to the ground while an Afghan Hound will be striking a pose on the couch. But personality encompasses both genetically-selected attributes, as well as individual life experiences. For that reason,there is no one-to-one relationship between personality characteristics and breed; personalities can vary within a particular breed based on the experiences of individual dogs.\nIn fact, in the recent book,Dog Sense: How the New Science of Dog Behavior Can Make You a Better Friend to Your Pet, anthrozoologist John Bradshaw comments that even in Scott and Fuller’s seminal research on dog behavior and genetics, “breed turned out to be less relevant to personality than had been expected at the outset.” The bottom line is that breed characteristics are certainly relevant to who a dog is, but they are not the be-all and end-all when it comes to personality.\nThe short answer to “What will my dog’s personality be?” is “Wait and see.” Current research finds that puppy tests have low predictive value for later-in-life behavior. On the other hand, personalities examined in older dogs do display more stability over time. Krista Macpherson, a PhD candidate at the University of Western Ontario who studies cognitive abilities in domestic dogs, reminds us that at the time of testing, puppies have had minimal interaction with the outside world, apart from their conspecifics. “At eight weeks, they are not that developed cognitively, and there are a lot of experiences yet to be had,” she observes.\nResearchers at the Clever Dog Lab (part of Austria’s University of Vienna) are currently investigating whether early temperament tests are predictive of behavioral tendencies in an older dog. By testing dogs at a range of ages, they will be able to explore the predictive value of early-life temperament tests. At the end of the day, Jules Winnfield, the gangster fromPulp Fiction, gets it right: “A dog’s got personality, and personality goes a long way.”",

A“sniffari”is an outing where your dog sniffs whatever they want and leads you where they want to go.

    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/7-better-ways-describe-dog-beyond-smart"
  },
  "page_content": "Obviously, your dog is the cutest, smartest pup on the planet. But here’s the thing: There are lots of other (read: better) ways to describe your dog. In fact, trainers and behaviorists like myself prefer to use more specific words to characterize dogs — terms that are far more useful in understanding them. Because the more specific the description, the more informative it is, which makes it easier to train and build a relationship with your dog. Below, seven ways to describe your dog — beyond “smart.”\n1. Biddable\nA dog who is biddable is docile, agreeable, and willing to do what you ask. A lot of people want biddable dogs and are happy to have a dog who wants nothing more than to do what they want. Biddable dogs are easy to live with. People without extensive dog-training skills are more likely to successfully train a biddable dog than other types of dogs.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n2. Trainable\nDogs who are trainable are often highly engaged with people, curious, eager to try new behaviors, and motivated by good reinforcement — oftentreats. Trainable dogs are able to maintain a high degree of attentiveness and keep their focus. Many people who describe their dogs as smart are actually commenting on how quickly and enthusiastically their dogs learn, which relates to trainability.\nChase? Wrestle? Tug-o-war? Find out which are fair game.\n3. Soft\nA dog who is soft is sensitive in various ways. A soft dog can easily be affected by even the gentlest disapproval, no matter how inadvertently or lovingly it’s expressed. Soft dogs will find even a calm “Oh no!” when they get in the garbage or your dismay at something entirely unrelated to them equally upsetting. Other dogs might barely register your gentle exclamations and won’t change their behavior in any way in response to them. Soft dogs are the ones who suffer most when punished, whether verbally or physically. (To be clear, I don’t use punishment with dogs and strongly advocate against doing so with any dog.)\n4. Bombproof\nThis word is about as far from an official term as you can get, but many trainers and behaviorists use it to describe a dog who is completely imperturbable. Some dogs can tolerate the most amazing array of issues: rude puppies; loud noises, such as a balloon popping or a stack of pots and pans hitting a tile floor; a person picking them up awkwardly or sneaking up on them from behind; children poking them; and even another dog barking, lunging, or snapping at them. Some professionals use their own bombproof dog (if they have one) for working with dog-dog aggression cases because the risk of psychological damage to their own dog is low, even if the other dog doesn’t act appropriately.\n5. Galoopy\nPronounced guh-LOOP-ee, this is another informal term making its way into the mainstream. A galoopy dog is anexuberant, goofy, carefree pup who is very happy and energetic. They tend to leap about and collide merrily with whatever or whoever is around, delighting in anything the moment brings. Such dogs appear to be smiling most of the time, especially in social situations, and may also appear to be moving in multiple directions simultaneously.\nA new study found that a dog’s breed accounts for less than 10 percent of their behavior.\n6. Persistent\nPersistent dogs don’t give up easily, and it can be hard to distract them or divert their attention. Many persistent dogs are excellent problem-solvers because they will keep trying to figure things out until they have a solution. It’s great if your dog is persistent with something you want them to continue doing, like working for the very last bit of peanut butter in aKongwhile you finish answering your email. It’s not so good if adog is persistent about barking, or scratching at the cabinet where you keep their food, hours before their dinner time.\n7. Affiliative\nWhile “affiliative” means social in nature, the term is preferred by behavioral biologists because in biology, “social” simply refers to species that live in groups rather than on their own — say, meerkats as opposed to leopards. Affiliative dogs are especially connected and bond strongly. They often seek physical contact and like to be close to other individuals. Affectionate and loving, they sometimes make even people who aren’t all that fond of dogs feel very loved.",

  "page_content": "As a pet parent, you’ve probably heard about “dominance dog theory,” a popular way of thinking about dog training. Advocates often support their argument by citing scientific evidence — especially data from ethologists — that dogs are pack animals. As such, they argue, dogs don’t need love from us — they just need to know their place.Sigh. It’s true that dogs are highly social animals, but that doesn’t mean they only operate by hierarchical pack rules. When it comes to human-dog relationships, we have to think bigger.\nUnderstanding Dominance Dog Theory\nHere are some “rules” under dominance dog theory:\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nDon’t pet your dog unless they work for it first.\nDon’t pet your dog unless they work for it first.\nDon’t let your dog move their head so that it is higher than your own.\nDon’t let your dog move their head so that it is higher than your own.\nDon’t feed your dog until after you’ve eaten.\nDon’t feed your dog until after you’ve eaten.\nDon’t step around your dog if they’re in your path; make them get up and move, even if they’re sound asleep.\nDon’t step around your dog if they’re in your path; make them get up and move, even if they’re sound asleep.\nDon’t let your dog sleep with you or cuddle with you on the couch.\nDon’t let your dog sleep with you or cuddle with you on the couch.\nDon’t clean up after your dog while they’re watching you.\nDon’t clean up after your dog while they’re watching you.\nWhy shouldn‘t you do these things? Because each action is said to cause your dog to think they’re dominant over you. Believe me; this isn’t what’s best for your or your dog’s happiness. As many other trainers and behaviorists repeat endlessly in books, blogs, and seminars, dominance is simply a description of a relationship between two individuals who want the same thing.\nWhen it’s time to call in reinforcements.\nWhat Does Dog Dominance Mean?\nOne animal is said to be “dominant” over the other if they always have primary access to the pork chop that falls on the floor, or the favorite toy, or the cozy lap of a dozing pet parent. Basically, it’s about the resolution of situations in which there might be competition for a resource. It isnotabout coming when called, or sitting when told to sit, or accepting unfamiliar dogs into the yard.\nWe’re not even sure how the concept of dominance relates to interactions between dogs, much less to interactions between two entirely different species, such as humans and dogs. At present, thoughtful ethologists and behaviorists are re-evaluating the concepts of “dominance” and “social status” as they relate to the domestic dog. Although there are questions and quibbles about some of the finer points, experts almost universally agree that the concept of “getting dominance” over our dogs is, at best, not useful, and more often is harmful to our relationships with our pets.\nThe Myth Of The “Alpha Wolf” Lives On\nYet, the idea that we must “dominate” our dogs lives on, zombie-like, in spite of years of research and experience that demonstrates “being dominant” over our dogs does not improve obedience. In fact, we know that using positive reinforcement results in the best behavior, the fewest behavioral problems, and the richest relationships. Given that, the question we need to ask ourselves is this: Why is the concept of achieving dominance over our dogs so seductive? Why is it so hard for people to give up? Given that humans are complex animals, I suspect there are many answers.\nSurely, one reason that so many people are enamored of the concept of dominance dog training is that social status is highly relevant to our species. No matter how egalitarian we are, the fact is that in restaurants, some people get better tables than others.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nHowever, we don’t seem to make the mistake within our own species that we make with our dogs, confounding social status or control with teaching or conveying information. Dogs are supposed to come when called, refrain from jumping up on company andwalk at perfect heeljust because we tell them to. Each of those actions requires learning; they are not natural to dogs and have to be taught.\nDog Training Isn’t That Simple\nMaybe another reason we are so susceptible to the fallacy of “getting dominance” over our dogs is that it makesdog trainingseem simple. One-stop shopping — just get your dog to accept you as “alpha,” and voilà! Your dog will stop jumping up on visitors and will quietly walk through the neighborhood at your side, ignoring all the interesting stuff — ahem,squirrels— they pass on the sidewalk.\nThe questions to ask and credentials to look out for to find the right trainer foryourdog, according to a pro.\nIt’s appealing to think that one overriding concept will take care of a host of behavioral issues. And hey, how hard could it be to talk your dog into believing that you are the alpha? You’re the one who can open the door, you’re the one who brings home thedog foodand you’re the one with the opposable thumbs. But training is much more complicated than that, and time has to be given to associating cues with each individual behavior.\nThe idea that all we need is respect (cue Aretha here) and our dog will behave perfectly is understandably seductive. Too bad it’s incorrect. Far worse, it can lead, at best, to a dog who performs because they are intimidated, and at worst, to adog who is abused. The fact is, dogs will respect us only if we are consistent, clear and fair. They will love and trust us only if we are loving and patient and are able to communicate to them in ways that they understand. That does not mean we need to “spoil” them and allow them to behave like rude and demanding house guests. However, we need to teach them how to behave in the society of another species, rather than expecting them to do what you say just because they want to please us.",

  "page_content": "The first thing you think to do when you meet a dog is to reach out your hand and give them a little pat on the head. If, however, you’ve done this, and a dog has looked at you like you justgreatly offendedthem, there might be a reason. Ask any dog trainer or behaviorist; we see it every day in the office, in classes and on neighborhood streets: people cheerfully patting their dogs, while the dogs look miserable.\nThis is not to say most dogs don’t love to be petted. Most of them do. But then...they don’t. Honest. Dogs love petting and they don’t love petting, and both of those statements are equally true. Ironically, the explanation for that seeming contradiction lies in the behavior of those who are actuallydoingthe petting.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nConsent isn’t just for humans. Here’s how to respond when the answer isn’t so simple.\nPut yourself in your dog’s snow booties for a minute, and it will all make sense. Like most humans, you probably love a good back rub. Just thinking about one can make most of us smile. But you don’t want one every minute of every day, do you? What if you’re in an important Zoom meeting? It would look pretty weird to Linda from accounting if a pair of hands were massaging your back while you went over next month’s budget. It’s all about timing.\nWhen Your Dog Doesn’t Want To Be Touched\nDogs are just like us: Their enjoyment of touchdependson when it’s offered, how it’s done, and where on the body it’s directed.\nContext is the variable that guardians most often ignore. Do you want a massage right now? Probably not, if you’re doing anything that requires concentration or engagement.\nDogs are no different: They most enjoy being stroked during quiet times, when the pack is settled in, cozied up in the living room or bedroom, the outside world shut away for awhile. They enjoy being stroked least when they’re in high-arousal play mode. Watch a dog who is called away from an exuberant play session and is “rewarded” with a pat on the head — most will turn their heads and move away. Most dogs are not fans of patted while greeting other dogs, eating their dinner, or doing something that requires concentration.\nAnd, just like people, dogs vary tremendously when it comes to who they want to touch them. Some are veritable streetwalkers, happy to get cuddly with anything with hands, while others are uncomfortable having strangers touch them at all, at least on the first date. We generally expect dogs to tolerate being touched by anyone, but that doesn’t mean they like it. They’re just usually not in a position to do much about it.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nIn general, most dogs enjoy being touched on:\nThe sides of their head\nThe sides of their head\nUnder their ears\nUnder their ears\nUnder their chin\nUnder their chin\nOn their chest\nOn their chest\nAt the base of their tail\nAt the base of their tail\nAlthough some dogs will turn inside out for any touch at all, most don’t like their paws handled, aren’t fond of anyone messing around with their hind legs or genitals, and downright hate pats on the top of their head. Of course, every dog — like every person — is different. Some people are particular about where they want to be touched; others are happy to make contact with another warm body any way they can.\nIndividual preferences are just as important for dogs as they are in people. In general, most of us enjoy gentle but firm strokes and rubs. But patting, especially rapidly and repeatedly on top of a dog’s head, tends to put them off. This should not come as a big shock to humans — how much would you like it if a stranger walked up and patted you on the top of your head? In spite of that, people do it to dogs all the time.\nInternationally renowned dog trainer Victoria Stilwell's tips for training pushy puppies.\nPetting Isn’t Always Rewarding to Pups\nWhen and how you pat your dog may seem like a trivial issue; we likely won’t see it on CNN any time soon. But it’s actually an important one, given the amount of suffering that people and dogs experience when the relationship between them goes sour. By patting their dog’s head as a reward for a good recall, dog parents everywhere think they are using positive reinforcement, but what they are really teaching the dog — with stunning effectiveness — isnotto come when called.\nPetting Plays a Role in Your Relationship\nTouch isvitally importantto the physical and psychological health of both species, and can even be used therapeutically.  But don’t greet your spouse or partners with happy slaps upside the head, do you? If you do, it likely doesn’t go over well at Thanksgiving.\nSo, when it comes to your dog, listen to what they want, when they want it. In the end, they might just reward you with more cuddles.",

  "page_content": "In gym class growing up, were you the kid who looked at the sit-and-reach box for the Presidential Physical Fitness test and thought, “I’m so flexible, I can push that little slide-y thing right off,” or were you the kid whose muscles were barely springy enough to touch the stupid box in the first place? We all have our (literal) limits, and it’s no different for cats and dogs.\nHave you ever thought about the athletic difference between dogs and cats? We already know that nutritional needs and personalities differ greatly between the two species, but what about their athletic prowess? We know they are both impressive runners, but how long can they go? How fast? As it turns out, it’s all about flexibility. There are some interesting anatomic differences between the two, and it starts with a little-known tendon in the neck called the nuchal ligament.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nHow Cats Are So Flexible\nCats, as we know, don’t hunt in packs, nor do they run their prey to exhaustion. Cats are solitary hunters and rely on stealth, explosive power and flexibility. From a sitting crouch, a cat can jump up to nine times their height, and in a split second, they can make sudden changes in direction and twist their spines mid-fall to land on all fours, according toCornell Center for Materials Research. It’s true: Cats almost always do land on their feet. Why can they do this?\nEspecially while shelters are overcrowded, consider adopting a cat.\nA cat’s spine is much more flexible than that of a dog. Their vertebral bones have increased elasticity in the disc between bones when compared to a dog, which is why cats don’t have the back problems that dogs tend to have. A cat’s vertebrae is also less tightly connected than a dog’s, making the spine far more flexible, and a cat’s pelvis and shoulders are more loosely attached to its backbone than dogs.\nA Big Physical Difference\nThe nuchal ligament attaches the head to the spine and is an adaptation designed to stabilize the head in animals that run fast and far. The nuchal ligament that dogs have is like the one that horses have. It supports the head without using muscles; it saves energy and makes the animal more efficient.\nWe also know dogs have historically relied upon a scent trail to hunt prey over long distances, while felines use hearing and eyesight to locate and hunt prey up close. “Dogs must follow their noses.”\nBoost your dog smarts with these cool facts.\nAs early dogs evolved longer legs, noses and necks, they needed the nuchal ligament to save energy while keeping their “nose to the ground” posture, run and follow scent trails over miles and miles. In Tedford Wang’s bookDogs: Their Fossil History and Evolutionary History,he shares that while dogs lost dexterity of their front limbs and evolved relatively weaker neck muscles needed to take down prey alone, they compensated by evolvinggroup huntingtechniques.\nDogs, humans, and horses have nuchal ligaments and are unique long-distance runners. You know who doesn’t have a nuchal ligament? Cats.\nAre Dogs Or Cats Faster?\nA cat can stretch their body and run with a stride that is three times their body length. A cat’s flexible spine, powerful muscles, and retractable/extendable claws that provide traction like runner’s spikes all contribute to top speeds of 30 miles per hour. There’s a reason the cheetah is the fastest animal in the world. However, a cat can only sustain this kind of anaerobic activity for very short periods of time, which makes a cat a fantastic sprinter but a terrible distance runner.\nSome dogs, such as Greyhounds, have top speeds of 45 miles per hour, but they only have the ability to maintain that speed for short distances. Most dogs, though, are capable of a range closer to 15 to 20 miles per hour, depending on their size and breed. But, because dogs are marathon runners, most are capable of maintaining a long-distance jog that cats cannot (and honestly, being cats,choose not to).\nDon’t take it personally — even if that’s hard to do.\nThe next time you see your dog or cat running, watch how they are different: Whether your companion animals are sprinting to pounce on a cat toy, jogging 10 miles with you, or prefer the strenuous athletic activity of couch surfing, all adult dogs and cats can benefit fromdaily exercise, a healthy weight, and a high-quality joint supplement.",

  },
  "page_content": "You’re at the dog park with your dog. You’ve got 15 minutes before a Zoom meeting, and you still have to make it back to the house. Then, you see them. Another dog and their owner have entered the dog run. Your dog sees them, too. They immediately get into position: the play-bow. You’re going to be late for that meeting.\nWhen dogs want to play, they let others know with play signals, like a play-bow, which they use to initiate play with other dogs — and to keep it going. These signals can mean different things, but the message always aims to keep play safe by telling other dogs that their intentions are playful. A play signal tells another dog, “I want to play.” If you want to build a stronger bond with your pup, consider communicating in ways that naturally make sense to them, such as a play-bow.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nScience of Play Signals\nBehaviorist Patricia McConnell, author ofPlay Together, Stay Together, has observed that when it comes to dogs and people, “play isn’t what makes our relationship with each other better, play is what creates the relationship in the first place.” A 2020 Bristol University survey found that most of the 4,000 respondents simply didn’t spend enough time playing with their dogs. The UK-based study also found a clear link between “limited playtime and animal behavior problems, such as being nervous when left alone, disobedience and snapping at other animals.”\nAvoid boredom when cooped up inside all winter.\nOthers have taken note of the role of play in our dogs’ lives as well. Marc Bekoff, one of the leading scientists of animal play, has said, “We train too much and play too little...Whenever you are playing together, you and your dog learn the most important rules of social interaction: mutual trust, accepting the limitations of the other individual, and dealing fairly with each other.”\nPlay is also the perfect opportunity for shared joy between pet and pet parent. As Mechtild Käufer, author ofCanine Play Behavior, writes, during play, you and your dog experience “moments in which two species — human and dog — really become one.”\nTranslating Dog Play-Bows\nA dog play-bow is a play signal that dogs use to initiate play with other dogs and signal to others that their intentions are playful. Play-bows communicate that even if the behavior to follow isroughor learned from other instincts — such as fighting or predation — and involves biting, chasing, shaking, or slamming into one another, it is playful in nature. There is no intent to cause harm. Using play signals to communicate makes it less likely that a dog’s actions will be misinterpreted, which can cause play to escalate intoaggression.\nSo, how does all this research and insight play out (no pun intended) in real life? Though the play-bow is a universal invitation to play among dogs, people can do it, too. A pet parent can imitate this action by getting down on all fours, putting both elbows on the ground, and leaving your butt in the air. Dogs usually perform play-bows in a springy, fast motion with a bounciness to it. If you want your play-bow to be as well-received as possible, try to mimic that springiness versus calmly moving into the posture like you are doing flowyoga.\nEven if your dog is injured and can't exercise, you can still keep them entertained. Here's how.\nA modified play-bow for people is possible, too, and it’s a little easier because you can remain standing. All you have to do is lean over from the hips, bend both legs, and spread your arms out at a 45-degree angle. To appear most playful to the dog receiving this signal, go into the pose quickly, perhaps even doing a little jump to go into the pose. Then, do something playful, like run away from your dog to start achase game.\nBonds Grow During Play\nPerforming a play-bow makes dogs happy because there is no confusion — they already know what it means. Here are some other ways that play signals can increase the bond with your dog.\nPlay develops trust and increases the degree and amount of attention your dog will pay to you. This is especially true if you let your dog occasionally win, even whenplaying tug. They call it “play” because it’s not goal-oriented. Try not to focus on winning ribbons or breaking records — in that case, it’s more like work, and the positive aspects disappear.\nPost-training play may extend a dog’s memory of previously learned behaviors by up to a year.\nIt’s well known that dogs will play longer with humans than with other dogs; they’re also less competitive and will present and surrender toys to humans more frequently. Even dogs inmulti-dog householdsare more (rather than less) interested in playing with humans.\nPlay signals also develop communication. To get your dog’sattention, hold a toy out in front of you, slap both hands on the ground, play-bow or make a quick forward movement. Play signals given by humans are more likely to elicit a response when accompanied by playvocalizations.\nDogs who frequently play rough-and-tumble games with their humans have fewer problems withseparation anxietyand are more self-confident. Not only that, but they score higher in “obedient attentiveness” after play sessions than before the sessions, according to researchers Nicola Rooney and John Bradshaw, which suggests that training after play can be highly effective.\nLet the games begin!",

    "title": "Should You Send Your Pup to Dog Daycare?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-lifestyle/dog-daycare"
  },
  "page_content": "There’s one universal stumper of a question that all pet parents face as they gear up for fewer summer vacations and more time at the office: “What do we do with the dog?”There’s never an easy answer — especially if your dog can’t easilytag along to workwith you — and it’s equallyanxiety inducingto think of leaving them with a stranger. This might be, however, an anxiety that can be quelled by professionals who spend all day loving on dogs just like yours.\nAcross the U.S., dog-daycare businesses — franchises and single-owner operations alike — are flourishing. They offer your dog what you sometimes cannot: playmates, companionship, and supervision when other commitments take you away from home. Most keep hours similar to those of daycare centers for children: drop your dog off before work, pick them up afterward.Dodog daycaresprovide a necessary service for both pet parents and their dogs? Are all daycares created equal? Is dog daycare an option you should consider? The answer is a resounding “it depends.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nDog Daycare Benefits\nMarc Bekoff, PhD, a University of Colorado ethologist who has studied dogs and their wild relatives for more than four decades, gives the concept of dog daycare a thumbs-up: “I love the idea. I think they provide a great function. At the same time, daycare should not replace people spending a good deal of time with their dogs.” E’Lise Christensen, DVM, a board-certified veterinary behaviorist in New York City, agrees: “For healthy, active, social dogs, daycare can be a great outlet for getting exercise and social enrichment.”\nNobody loves your dog like you love your dog. But wouldn’t it be great if your dog sitter was a close second?\nIn fact, this belief is exactly what originally spurred the development of the dog daycare industry. “In the early 1990s, training professionals found there was a need for dogs to get out of the house, socialize and engage inmental stimulationand physical exercise,” explains Melinda Miller, hospital director at Smith Ridge Veterinary Center in South Salem, N.Y.Social play and mental stimulation are the main reasons many people choose to enroll their dogs in daycare. Pet parents might want to send their dogs to a place to burn off energy, be social and run around without worrying about them being bored and alone. The complex process of domestication did not shape dogs for a solitary living (raise your hand if one is napping at your feet as you read this). On the other hand, dogs did not evolve to engage in all-day play sessions either.\nDo Dogs Like Going to Daycare?\nDog daycare websites feature buzz words like “play,” “fun,” and “canine friends,” words that, for pet parents, readily elicit images of their dog exuberantly sparring with a new best friend. But what do social experiences at dog daycares look like?\nIn the daycare setting, dyadic play (play between two dogs) is probably the most prevalent type. Arecent studyinvestigating social play in adult, group-housed dogs at a boarding kennel found that of 343 social-play bouts, all but one were dyadic in nature.\n“This is not surprising,” notes Alexandra Horowitz, PhD, a professor of psychology at Barnard College, who has studied dog play behavior extensively. “Dyadic play is an easier dynamic for most dogs than triadic or larger-group play. In a bigger group of players, it would be hard to have play signals in all those different directions, and a dog could certainly miss something. Because of the complexity of play, this high-paced, rambunctious activity needs a lot of coordination.”\nA few minutes — or even a few steps — are all you need to add joy to your dog’s day.\nThe idea of giving dogs space to play might seem straightforward enough, but there’s more to it than simply providing square feet. Numerous factors can influence the presence or absence of happy frolicking. While a dog’sphysical sizewarrants consideration when forming daycare playgroups,play styleis paramount.\nBecky Trisko, PhD, behaviorist and owner of Unleashed in Evanston, Ill., knows this well. “A good daycare surveys play styles and groups dogs accordingly. At the same time, [it] also allows flexibility between groups throughout the day to manage personalities and excitement levels.”\nBalancing Dog Play Styles\nWhen it comes to play, turning up the dial is not always better. As Miller explains, “Hyper dogsallowed to get into a frenzy and maintain that level of excitement all day can be worse in the home than they were before they went to daycare. Staff members who help dogs learn about relaxed play and recognize when dogs need a time out or a change of pace and rest are helping both dog and pet parent.” Trisko agrees. “Pet parents often assume that an exhausted dog is a happy dog. But an exhausted dog could also be an irritated dog.”\nIn a well-run daycare, these issues are addressed by handlers who ensure that dogs engage in the congenial play their people envision. While no formal research has been done to validate these numbers, the consensus is that an ideal handler-to-dog ratio is 1:10, or 1:15 at the outside (Christensen recommends a ratio of 1:5).\nBe better than basic. These three pet sitting rules will ensure you’re the type of sitter that keeps clients raving.\nIf groups grow in size, so too should the level of human attention. But even with multiple human hands on deck, large dog groups can be challenging to manage. Kate Senisi, a former daycare employee, knows this firsthand. “Daycares that create multiple, smaller groups within a space, as opposed to one large group, allow for more direct supervision of the dogs. But that also means that the daycare has to provide additional staff to cover the new groups,” she says.\nDone right, supervision gives dogs the variety they need within a complex environment. Though many daycares tend to highlight “all-day play,” a quick review of online daycare videos reveals dogs engaged in any number of activities. Some dogs play, some watch; others investigate something on the floor, jump on a handler, sit on a handler’s lap or lie on the floor. In other words, individual dogs have a range of interests that shift moment by moment, and good supervision can facilitate this variety.\nAccording to Horowitz, it’s important that dogs have options and control. “Not to say that the dog is dictating the day, but that the dog has options to be social, to be with a person or by themselves. That would be the highest-quality day: a lot of things to do and being able to make choices about when and with whom to do it.”\nHandlers perform a critical role in promoting fun and safety. Much like playground monitors, they pick up on individual behavioral cues — for example, noticing when a dog becomesanxiousor has simply been playing for three hours straight and could use a change of pace. Fun can quickly disappear when a dog finds themself in an environment that conflicts with their emotional state.\nThe often-overlooked aspect of dog daycare is, of course, learning. “An important factor to consider,” says Laura Monaco Torelli, director of training at Animal Behavior Training Concepts in Chicago, “is that dogs are always learning, even in the daycare environment.”\nJust as a toddler might return from preschool with their first painting of a flower and a bit of an attitude, so too might a dog return from daycare all tuckered out, and a bit jumpier and mouthierthan when they went in.\nAre All Doggy Daycares the Same?\nAt the end of the day, dog daycares are unregulated businesses. While daycare owners, managers and employees probably become involved in this particular enterprise because they love dogs and are interested in promoting canine welfare, it is an industry with no agreed-upon set of “best practices.” Some might have learned the business from authorities in the dog training and care world; for others, a random instructional website might suffice.\nJust as a love of children does not necessarily make someone a competent first-grade teacher, a love of dogs doesn’t automatically equip a person to manage the behaviors and personalities of a group of them.\n“Is a daycare just looking for warm bodies who like dogs and can stay there for eight hours a day?” asks Miller.\nChristensen adds: “Is the staff trained [in] the basics of dog behavior as based on science, not popular wisdom?”\nSet your pup up for success.\nStaffers’ ability to recognize stress and discomfort is just as important as their understanding of the complex set of movements that make up play. Play andaggressive displaysshare many elements, and even to a watchful, astute eye, meanings can change quickly.\nSome daycares highlight their facilities’ bells and whistles: climate control, dog cams, unique flooring, or even a particular type of background music. Unfortunately, many daycare websites are silent on the less flashy ethological and organizational considerations that are most relevant to those concerned about their dogs’ welfare. For example, daycares rarely describe daily play and rest schedules, handling techniques, procedures for introducing new dogs to the group, criteria that determine how dogs are grouped, handler-to-dog ratios, access to outdoor space, and staff first-aid training.\nThere are many ways to handle the daily influx of bouncing dogs, and at their best, daycares do this by viewing every dog as an individual. Some daycares rely on message boards to keep track of the different canine personalities gracing their establishments. Descriptors might read: “Don’t let anyone jump on Tiger’s back. Keep Bella from being overstimulated. Keep Buddy fromeating rocksor poop.”\nBut how do daycares uncover these nuances?\nA behavior assessment is the first step toward getting to know each dog’s unique needs. Even if a dog has been comfortable in comparable settings, there’s no foolproof way to predict how they will feel in a new environment. Each daycare provides a unique mix of sights, smells, sounds, movements and management styles, and any dog could be less- than-thrilled with their surroundings. Even dogs described by their pet parents as “social butterflies” or “happy players” do not necessarily thrive in every setting.\nA new study found that a dog’s breed accounts for less than 10 percent of their behavior.\nAssessments can also identify dogs who are not likely to be thrilled about daycare from the get-go. For some, discomfort with other dogs could spark aggression; others might be unable to de-stress in a group setting. With this information, daycares can evaluate whether they have the staff know-how and facility design to admit such dogs.\nThe behavior assessment is just the beginning of the story. John Squires, owner and manager of Wag Club in Brooklyn, N.Y., stresses that the daycare facility has an ongoing role in habituating each dog to its setting and rewarding good behavior. He has found that, unfortunately, not all daycares prioritize such methods. Some accept dogs who are not a good fit for a daycare environment without taking steps to help them acclimate, which could lead to a dog spending most of their time in a kennel rather than interacting with others.\nIs Doggy Daycare for Your Dog?\nThe answer lies mainly with theindividual dog. Some daycares are better than others at maximizing fun and safety and decreasing fear and stress. At the same time, dog daycare is not the only game in town. Your dog might prefer along walk, atraining class, a trip to thedog park, an open window where they can take in the passing sights and sounds, or a small playgroup. Consider what’s important to and appropriate for your dog. Also, consider how you might be able to build time for these extras into your schedule.\nDoes your dog freak out when you head for the door? Here’s some advice.\nWhen thinking about our dogs’ quality of life, most of us inevitably ask the question, “What should my dog be doing all day while I’m gone?” If you think the answer for your dog involves daycare, then the next question is, “Which one?” A little due diligence on your part will result in a solution that’s right for your pup.\nTips for Finding the Best Dog Day Care\nIf you think your dog is being “interviewed” for daycare, think again. While their behavior is assessed and their vaccination record is examined, your job is to be the real interviewer. When checking out daycare operations, get answers to the following questions.\nTake a tour. Is it clean? Does it have multiple spaces for groups of dogs with different play styles? Do dogs have access to an outside area for bathroom breaks? Does the facility have a designated area for rest? If the daycare uses kennels, check them out and ask if and how stress is minimized during kenneling.\nAll-day play is not a selling point. Dog daycares that incorporate bathroom breaks (ideally, outdoors), playtime, and quiet time into their schedules are what you’re looking for. Rest is important, and it is handled differently by each daycare. Find out how a daycare provides a restful space for its canine visitors.\nThe handler-to-dog ratio should be 1:10 (preferable), 1:15 tops. After all, 1:10 equals two human eyes and legs monitoring 10 noses, 20 eyes and 40 legs. On top of that, handlers often need to deal with other things in the environment — refereeing a play session that’s gotten a little over the top or cleaning up an accidental “deposit” — so having more than one person on duty is a plus.\nDaycare owners or managers might have Certification Council of Professional Dog Trainers (CPDT) credentials or be animal-behavior-conference junkies, but top-level staff are not customarily involved in daily dog supervision. Make sure the hands-on staff members are trained in canine communication and dog handling. Ask handlers about their training experience (or lack thereof).\nGradual introductions set dogs up for success. Avoid a daycare that proclaims, “We throw them all in together for a fun playtime!”\nThere’s a lot more to it than sniffing each other’s butts.\nAccepting all dogs is not necessarily a good thing; remember, not all dogs are cut out for daycare. Whether a dog is too aggressive or too shy, some dogs will simply do better with awalkor home care.\nDoes the daycare provide toys? If so, which ones, and how does it prevent or monitor resource-guarding? While your dog might not exhibit this particular behavior, daycares should have procedures to address this potential issue and avoid needless confrontations between dogs.\nIdeally, the daycare has a relationship with a veterinarian and staff members who are trained in CPR and first aid. In even the best-monitored situations, accidents can happen, and a quick response can be a literal lifesaver.\nAll of these questions — and thorough research — will likely give you the answer that’s right for you. And if daycare is the right choice, your pup is going to be thankful for treats and all that extra attention.",

  "page_content": "Deciding to adopt your pet was probably what you’d call “a gut decision” — heavily influenced by cuteness. When it comes to our physical gut, though, there are all sorts of vitamins and supplements claiming to set things right and make you feel better.\nAlthough our pets’nosestell them more about the world than their guts might, they need some TLC in that area, too. If you’ve got a dog or cat who acts anxious or lashes out, you’ve probably tried everything from environmental changes to behavior modification to medication. But one thing you may not have considered is a deep dive into your pet’sgut microbiome.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nNot sure how gut health connects to one’s emotional response? It has to do with the gut-brain axis, which is how the digestive tract communicates back and forth with the central nervous system. If you’ve ever felt butterflies in your stomach when you’re worried, you’ve experienced thegut-brainaxis in action.\nResearchers studying the connection between gut health and mental disorders in humans have found evidence suggesting that regulating gut bacteria could help alleviate anxiety symptoms. And it turns out the same could be true for our furry friends.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nThe Gut’s Role in Mental Health\nSerotonin and dopamine are examples of “feel good” chemicals used by the brain to affect mood and decision-making. Bacteria in the gut produces the bulk of these chemicals. Other bacteria in the gut may produce chemicals that promote anxiety or mood disorders. So, it makes sense that regulating gut bacteria could affect mood or behavior. Studies have found differences in the microbiomes ofanxious miceandaggressive dogsthat could prove helpful for developing treatments and therapies.\nSteps Pet Parents Can Take\nThe thought that a healthy gut could alleviate your pet’s symptoms of anxiety or aggression may have you gleefully reaching for a container ofprobiotic-packed yogurt. But before you do, it’s best to chat with your veterinarian. Ahealthy gut is vitalfor many reasons, including breaking down food, absorbing nutrients, and maintaining a healthy immune system.\nAccording to veterinarian Dr. Jessica Heckman, “an unhealthy gut often makes itself known through soft stools or even diarrhea. These are the most common veterinary indications that a dog might benefit from probiotics.” There are alsotests availablethat can analyze the bacteria in your pet’s gut.\nShudder.It happens to all of us.\nThe food you give your pet can impact their gut health. Certain processed foods can harm the microbiome. Your veterinarian can help you determine the best diet for your pup’s needs.\nThere are some probiotic products for dogs that specifically claim to promote calm behavior and alleviate anxiety. Other probiotic supplements geared toward general digestive health are available for dogs or cats, but further research is needed to determine how well they work for reducing anxiety or aggression. Still, they may be a good option to consider if your pet is experiencing issues or as a preventive measure.\n“There’s a lot we don’t know about probiotics,” Dr. Hekman says. “Some pet owners do include them proactively; others don’t. But since they are very safe, there is no harm in doing so. Just be sure to always let your veterinarian know about any supplements you are giving your pet.”\nTime for a (literal) gut check from four experts.\nTreating anxiety or aggression in pets can be difficult and time-consuming. And it often requires a combination of therapies to address the root cause and change behaviors. Managing gut health may be one of the areas you and your pet’s healthcare team can explore. Dr. Hekman agrees.\n“With a serious behavioral issue, I recommend working with a veterinary behaviorist (rather than a non-veterinary behavior consultant) to discuss treatment,”  she says. It’s very worthwhile to discuss probiotics and the possibility of a microbiome issue with a behaviorist.”\nNo matter what you decide, it’s always best to go with your...gut.",

This sounds simple, but it can be a struggle for many pet parents.\nHumans express love and affection with kisses, but kisses have no particular meaning to dogs. It is not a natural part of their repertoire.Dogs lick each other and will lick humans, too, and though we often call those “doggy kisses,” they’re different than human kisses. Putting your face right next to a dog’s face can be perceived by the dog as threatening behavior. Some dogs find it scary, while others simply find it annoying. It’s common for dogs who are being kissed to try to get away, to hold their ears back, or to exhibit signs of discomfort such as tongue-flicking, yawning, lowering the tail or displaying facial and body tension. Some dogs wrinkle their noses or even scamper off once released — another sign that they don’t love being kissed no matter how much they love you.\nChase? Wrestle? Tug-o-war? Find out which are fair game.\nDogs who’ve been consistently reinforced for shaking or giving a high-five may have good feelings about having you touch or hold their paws, but that usually only applies to brief contact while they’re sitting. Nothing good can come of grabbing a dog’s paw and holding on to it for a while. It may make them feel unstable, and that’s no fun, or they may associate it with nail trims (also no fun) or having their muddy paws wiped down (not awful, but not a favorite either). Holding a dog’s back paw is often particularly poorly received.\nThe majority of dogs hate the smell of citrus: lemons, tangerines, and grapefruit. That’s why those scents are used in products meant to deter dogs from chewing on things we would prefer they leave alone. Because the smell repels dogs, it’s kind to avoid products with that scent, including lotion, shampoo, air fresheners, or candles. A small percentage of dogs aren’t averse to these smells. Find out if your dog is in this group by peeling a juicy orange, so your hands are covered in a sticky mess, then offer your hands to your dog. If they turn or back away, they (like most dogs) don’t care for the smell of citrus. If they lick your fingers, different story.\nIt's the one food most dogs can't stand. Here's why — plus, how to use their dislike of citrus to your advantage.\nThe joy pet parents take in dressing up their dogs is often in direct conflict with the distaste dogs have for the experience. Yes, dogs look adorable in just about every outfit under the sun, but very few dogs enjoy the process of being put into clothes and costumes. Lots of dogs tense up, displaying facial expressions and body language that clearly indicate their discomfort. Wearing clothes, especially cumbersome and constricting costumes, is a misery for many dogs.\nThrough careful conditioning, dogs can be taught to accept costumes or other clothes. If you must, choose the least restrictive and most lightweight options, but dogs would really prefer you miss them with the costume. Many pet parents can’t help but love the look of dogs dressed to the nines, but mostly, it’s better not to treat dogs like dolls.\nApologies to your Halloween plans.\nWhen to DIY your dog’s Halloween costume or dye their fur — and when to leave it to the pros.",

  "page_content": "You’re lying on the couch under your heaviest blanket. Your energy is low. You feel a little...off. Your pup snuggles up to you like they know something is wrong. Then, the following day, you wake up with the flu.\nIf it ever seems that your dog has the uncanny ability totell when you’re sick, it’s not all in your (stuffed-up) head. From reading body language to actually sniffing out disease, dogs have several ways they can pick up on illnesses. We did a little digging, including checking in with Dr. Glen Golden — a research scientist at Colorado State University’s Department of Biomedical Science — to find out just how far a dog’s detection skills go.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nLet’s start with a dog’s most impressive tool: their nose. A dog’ssense of smellis between 10,000 and 100,000 times better than a person’s. That’s a lot. But what does a keen sense of smell have to do with telling when someone is sick?\nExperts share the science-backed ways our pets offer us emotional support.\n“Since Hippocrates, it has long been speculated that diseases might be diagnosed based on odor,” says Dr. Golden. “Over the last decade, studies have shown that the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in urine, feces, breath, or other bodily emanations have been successfully used to detect disease or infection. This has led researchers to conclude that VOCs found in waste are a window into the body.”\nDogs Are Skilled Sniffers\nDogs can learn to detectvarious diseases, including diabetes and breast cancer, by sniffing urine, sweat, and breath. And some researchers are currently training dogs to detect COVID-19. In fact, arecent studyfound that trained dogs are better at detecting COVID than rapid antigen tests. A dog can be a reliable way to sniff out (literally) certain illnesses. But sometimes, dogs pick up on conditions or medical events for reasons that are less clear.”\nDr. Golden explains: “We know dogs can respond to an oncomingepilepsyevent or a PTSD fugue state. But what, exactly, they are responding to isn’t definitively known. There is some evidence to suggest that, in the case of epilepsy, dogs are responding to a certain odor. However, it hasn’t been proven that odor is the only thing driving the response. With PTSD, there’s strong anecdotal evidence that dogs are responding to a variety of stimuli, including human micro-expressions and body language.”\nScientists confirm the myriad physical and psychological benefits of pet parenthood.\nThis means dogs’ ability to detect illness goes beyond their sense of smell. Since the average dog hasn’t been trained to alert people to the presence of diseases, the reason your dog seems to know when you’re sick probably has little to do with odor — and a lot to do with their relationship to you.\nBut They Shouldn’t Replace Medical Providers\nYour dog knows you — your body language, your behaviors, and your routines. They’re also very good at reading moods and picking up on changes to the norm. Take facial expressions, for example. Dogs canrecognizewhen you’re mad, relaxed, happy, or down. Andresearchhas also shown that they can pick up on (and respond to) emotional cues by listening to changes in a person’s voice. So, if something is a little off with you, chances are your dog will know it.\nAt this point, you may be wondering, if dogs are so great at identifying when someone isn't well, will they ever play an everyday role in human healthcare? According to Dr. Golden, we shouldn’t hold our breath for the day dogs show up in exam rooms as part of, say, a routine dermatology screening.\nIt’s science (and adorable).\n“Dogs have been shown to use their noses to reliably detect melanoma, but that doesn’t mean our canine friends are likely to be used in place of lab tests,” Golden says. Instead, researchers are working to better understand how a dog’s (or other mammal’s) nose can be so much more sensitive than current medical testing.”\nOK.\nSo, dogs won’t be used in the average doctor’s office. But what if you could train your own dog to pick up on certain conditions and use them as a warning system for oncoming illnesses? With patience and proper training techniques, this might be possible. But just because a pet parent can potentially train their dog to alert them to certain stimuli doesn’t mean they should. Dr. Golden warns that “training a dog to alert you to an oncoming migraine, for example, could result in complacency over a dangerous situation, or cause you to ignore other symptoms that would be best detected by a medical doctor.”\nIn other words, people with medical degrees are still important; your primary care physician shouldnotbe your dog. But that doesn’t mean we can’t appreciate the extra attention our furry friends give us when we’re under the weather. They still make the best — and cuddliest — nurses around.",

  },
  "page_content": "Not everyone is a hugger. After nearly three years of a pandemic, many humans are still incredibly OK with the concept of social distancing (and will be for years to come). Your dog doesn’t have to use COVID precautions as an excuse; they also just might notwanta hug.\nAnimal behaviorists, including myself, have regularly expressed caution when it comes to hugging dogs because, well, most dogs don’t like it. This area hasn’t been formally studied, but Stanley Coren, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia, reviewed the data and sharedhis takein an informative post.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nHere’s how you know if you’ve got a hugger — or a pup who prefers a bit of social distance.\nIt’s all about signs of stress.\nCoren viewed 250 random photos on the internet of people hugging dogs. For each image, he determined whether the dog fit one of three categories: 1) the dog appeared stressed or anxious, 2) the dog appeared relaxed and at ease, and 3) the dog appeared neutral or ambiguous.Signs of stress can be tongue-flicking,ears down, face averted, eyes showing “half-moons” of white, tightly closed mouth, rigid facial muscles, and furrowed brows. Dogs who are relaxed and happy tend to have open mouths, relaxed facial muscles, and no signs of stress. Coren only included photos in which the dog’s face was visible and where no other obvious stressor was present, for example, being picked up while being hugged.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nCoren found that of the 250 dogs, 204 dogs (81.6 percent) showed one or more signs of stress, discomfort, or anxiety, 27 (10.8 percent) of the dogs showed either neutral or ambiguous reactions to being hugged, and 19 (7.6 percent) seemed comfortable with being hugged. From this data, Coren concluded that it makes sense to recommend that humans refrain from hugging dogs and save their hugs for other humans.\nThese results aren’t surprising. Based on my behavior and training experience, I’m inclined to agree that the majority of dogs are not as crazy about hugs as people are. The pictures reviewed by Coren might even underestimate dogs’ dislike for hugging because the pictures were posted by people who presumably want to show theirlove for their dogs. Coren points out that they are not likely to choose photos that show their dog’s most blatant signs of distress, at least not if they recognize those signs.\nHis results have been met with mixed reception.\nCoren’s suggestion that it is not a good idea to hug dogs has many pet professionals nodding their heads in agreement, but some have also objected to it. Most of the objections are from people saying that their dogs love being hugged. Over the years, I have had countless clients — in private consultations and in classes — who swear that their dogs do like being hugged. However, whenever they embraced their dog to demonstrate, I identified signs of stress. It’s very common for people, especially children, to be bit while hugging a dog, unaware of the stress signals.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nWhen hugged, most dogs show visible signs of anxiety and discomfort. Some tolerate it, but I would at best call their reactions neutral. Rarely will I encounter a dog that doesn’t mind (or has just learned to stop reacting). Either way, I do not see dogs who are convincingly happy about it. My personal experience is generally in line with what Coren found in his research, though he did see more dogs who were comfortable with hugging than I have.\nVery few dogs like hugs, but there are exceptions.\nCoren’s finding that a minority of dogs were comfortable with hugs will be reassuring to many pet parents who are confident that their dogs love being hugged. I would encourage anyone who feels that their dogs fit into this category to make an effort to be sure. Observe your dog carefully during a hug to check for signs ofanxiety, stress, or discomfort.\nFeeling like your dog is the exception is comparable to the well-known fact that most people think that they are above-average drivers. Similarly, many parents believe that they are in that rare minority of people who do not regularly embarrass their teenagers. Obviously, there are exceptions to any rule, but most people (and dogs) can’t be the exception. This phenomenon is called the “better-than-average” effect.\nNot all fearful dogs have been mistreated.\nThat said, there are exceptions. It depends on the individual dog, who is doing the hugging, the situation, and how the dog is being hugged. If you hug a behaviorally healthy, non-aggressive dog and then offer them a piece of chicken and do that repeatedly (by which I mean hundreds of times), you are likely to teach them to be happy about hugs.\nHow you hug your dog makes a difference.\nYou probably feel a little bummed that your pup (most likely) doesn’t share your love for hugs. Let’s be clear, though: This doesn’t mean your dog doesn’t love snuggling and cuddling. A hug is a full embrace with both arms around a dog’s body or neck and is definitely not the same as a cuddle. If you share a strong bond with your dog, they may be more willing to tolerate a hug occasionally — just try not to overdo it. When in doubt, don’t hug the dog. Here are a few pointers to help you determine if it’s OK to hug a dog.\nDogs who like to snuggle may be happy to lean against someone, but remember it is not the same experience as a hug where a human wraps their arms around them.\nA gentler hug that is not as long, tight, or high up on the neck may be easier for dogs to accept.\nKids are more likely to squeeze too strongly and hang on a dog’s neck, so be sure to carefully observe your dog for signs of distress.\nTall dogs who stand on their back legs and put their front paws on a person’s shoulders are often quite happy to give hugs (again, this is different from receiving hugs).\nDon’t try to hug your dog when they’re busy with some other activity, such as eating, or if they don’t appear to be in a good mood.\nWhile this should be obvious, don’t hug just any random dog. Hugging unfamiliar dogs is a risky proposition that could lead todog bites.\nIn short, some dogs are fine if you bring on the love, but it truly depends on the pup. Just like it’s important to get to know a human and ask for consent (it’s 2022, people!), your dog needs the same courtesy and has boundaries. Be cool.",

  },
  "page_content": "“She must have been abused,” is a comment I hear with alarming regularity. When a dog cowers and shakes or barks and growls at a person wearing a hat, it’s natural to think that the strong reaction is proof of previous harsh treatment by someone wearing a hat. It’s easy to conclude that a dog who’s scared of children was teased by the neighborhood bully. Similarly, it’s logical to assume that a dog would only react aversely to a broom after having had terrifying experiences with one.\nWithout a doubt, fartoo many dogs suffer abuse, but not all dogs who appear to have been abused have necessarily been treated badly. Some are fearful because they were inadequately socialized, or have a genetic tendency to be fearful, or both. As often as not, a history of abuse is actually not a factor.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhy Some Dogs Are Afraid of Men\nThe most common scenario that leads people to conclude that a dog has been abused is the dog who’s fine with women but scared of men. In these cases, while it’s possible that a man abused the dog, the fact that a dog is afraid of men doesn’t prove the theory. Typically, dogs who havefearful tendenciesare more scared of men than of women. I’ve met hundreds of dogs who were only scared of men, and exactly two who feared women more. The fact is, dogs who are fearful have a natural propensity to be more afraid of men. Nobody knows for sure why this is, but it’s likely that men’s larger size, broader shoulders, deeper voices and facial hair make them more intimidating.\nAnother reason that dogs might be more afraid of men was suggested by a study reported inCurrent Biology:When motion was detected only on point light displays*, observers perceived an interesting difference between male and female movement. Figures considered masculine in gait seemed to be approaching, while both feminine and gender-neutral gaits were seen as heading away. Fearful dogs are typically most frightened when something scary moves toward them — this may explain why they find men more alarming than women.\nPro tips for boosting the confidence of a scaredy-cat dog.\nHow Scent Plays into Fear\nScent may also be a factor: “Olfactory exposure to males, including men, causes stress and related analgesia in rodents,” according to a report inNature Methods.The study showed that mice and rats react differently to male and female experimenters because of differences in the way that they smell. That means that all studies of these rodents’ behavior may have been influenced by the gender of the people conducting the study. The test animals became highly stressed and exhibited decreased pain responses in the presence of human males; even T-shirts worn by men (but not those worn by women) caused this reaction.\nThe rodents were similarly stressed by odors from males of a range of species, including dogs, cats, guinea pigs and even other rodents. Males release certain pheromones in larger concentrations than females — and these fear-inducing chemicals are shared among mammals — which means that dogs could also be affected by them. Scent differences could very likely affect dogs and cause them to be more frightened around some people.\nMisunderstandings About Fearful Dogs\nThe assumption that fear of men indicates a history of abuse by a man is not the only one that may be erroneous. Many people are sure thatdogs who react negativelyto people with hats or backpacks means there has been past abuse by a person sporting those same accessories. While again, this is possible, it’s more likely that the dog is simply unfamiliar with the objects themselves and the way that they change people’s appearance. Many react fearfully to a changed silhouette, becoming frightened, for example, by the sight of someone they know and love wearing a hat. Once the person removes the hat, the dog switches to happy greeting behavior.\nAnother commonly misunderstood area relates to the fear of children. Many dogs are skittish around children because of their erratic behavior, especially if they were not well socialized to them at an early age. After all, from a dog’s perspective, kids behave in peculiar and unexpected ways. They change direction suddenly, roll on the ground, move at variable speeds, make weird noises and are generally high-energy hurricanes. Dogs who are naturally fearful may find excitable, loud humans in motion to be unpredictable, which is frightening. (On the flip side, there are fearful dogs who do fine with kids, but are terrified of adults. Usually, such dogs have had positive experiences with children and are used to their erratic behavior.)\nUsing these tips, your skittish dog will warm up to you.\nHow to Tell if a Fearful Dog Has Been Abused\nIf a dog’s fearfulness toward specific types of people or certain everyday items doesn’t necessarily mean that the dog has been abused, how can you tell if your dog suffered from abuse in the past? The honest answer is that — unless you have the dog’s full backstory —  you can never know for certain. However, some clues may help you make an educated guess. Abuse is less likely as an explanation for a dog’s fearfulness if the dog’s reactions fit the pattern associated with dogs who are naturally fearful.\nThe most common pattern is for such dogs to be cautious around strangers, especially men, and to be worse around tall, deep-voiced men with beards, or anyone carrying things — garden tools, brooms or mops, a clipboard — or wearing sunglasses, a backpack, or a hat. Dogs with a generally fearful approach to the world often react most vigorously when unfamiliar people approach, look directly at them, stand up from a sitting position or reach down to pet them.\nIf the dog has sustained multiple injuries, such as broken bones or teeth, or has scars on its face and body, abuse is more likely. Of course, those injuries could be a result of accidents, and some forms of abuse leave no scars. Still, a dog with unexplained evidence of physical trauma is more likely to have been a victim of abuse than a dog without it.\nIf a dog is fearful of highly specific attributes, it is more likely to be based on trauma, which could have come in the form of abuse. So, if a dog is afraid of freckled, redheaded children with glasses in the age range of 10 to 12 years, but fine with all other kids, it’s more likely that a negative experience with a child of that description caused the fear. On the other hand, if a dog is only okay with children who are older than about 16, my bet would be that the dog lacks experience with a wide range of children and is only comfortable with children who are more adult-like in size and behavior. Similarly, if the dog is okay with men unless they are wearing loafers with a buckle, I would be inclined to suspect abuse. Specificity of fears is more likely to indicate abuse, because dogs who are generally fearful are usually set off by a wider range of triggers.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nOther Exceptions to Keep In Mind\nEven in the case of a specific fear, we have to be careful about assuming that abuse was the cause. For example, I had a client whose dog was fearful of and aggressive toward only one person. Sounds like that person might have beaten the dog, right? Not in this case. The man the dog was afraid of was the neighbor who had saved the dog’s life during a house fire; the wonderful man went into the house and carried the dog out before the firefighters arrived. Until then, the dog liked this man, but was terrified of him after the fire, presumably because he associated the man with the horrible experience.\nWhile anyone who loves dogs wants to know if a particular dog has been abused, the same process is used to help a dog overcome fears of any origin. Classical conditioning, desensitization and patience will serve people and dogs equally well. It’s critical not to force a frightened dog into situations that provoke fear, but instead, to protect the dog from scary circumstances. Be gentle and kind and refrain from using punishment. Feel free to comfort any dog who is scared without worrying about the common (but misplaced) warning that this will reinforce the fear. Accept that many fearful dogs never become gregarious, go-with-the-flow types, and love them for who they are rather than who you think they should be.\nSome people seem relieved when I tell them that their dog may not have been abused, while others seem disappointed to give up the “feel good” story of adopting a dog who was mistreated. I empathize with both groups: I can understand the relief, and I can also understand how gratifying it feels to give a loving home to a dog who only knew cruelty before. And while I certainly can’t say definitively which dogs with unknown histories have been abused and which haven’t, I agree with other progressive trainers and behaviorists that abused dogs are not as common as one might think.\n* Point-light displays are made by filming people, animals or objects with reflective markers or point lights attached to the major joints, and then processing the video so that only the point lights are visible.",

  },
  "page_content": "The way your dog wags their tail says a lot about how they’re feeling. That’s because there is a lot of information contained in the movement — tail wags can mean so many things. The speed, amplitude, and looseness of the tail are all informative when assessing a tail wag, as is the height of the tail. The complexity of the tail wag is immense, and while many people unfamiliar with dog behavior think that a tail wag means a dog is friendly and happy, dog savvy people all know that this is an inaccurate and oversimplified interpretation.\nHowever, there is one particulartype of tail wagthat means what most people think a tail wag means — that the dog is happy or friendly (or both). That type of wag is called a “circle wag,” “propeller wag,” or even a “helicopter tail.” All terms mean that the tail is rotating at the base and that the tip is moving in a broad circle. I love to see circle wags because they tend to indicate such friendly, happy dogs.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat Does a “Circle Wag” Mean?\nMost often, a dog will wag their tail in a circle if they are particularly overjoyed to see someone special, especially someone they haven’t seen recently. Many videos of reunions between military people returning from deployment and the dogs that stayed behind feature circle wags. Some dogs have this level of enthusiasm — and the corresponding circle wag — every time they greet members of their family, no matter the length of the absence.\nGenerally, the more the wag encompasses the whole body, the friendlier the dog’s intentions. The full body tail wag that extends from the shoulders through the belly to the hips and the tail is the classic friendly tail wag. Even though a circle wag is typically interpreted (and accurately so) as a sign of friendliness and positive emotions, I’ve often wondered if even that isn’t an oversimplification.\nIf your pup's exuberant tail wagging has led to injury, they could have this condition.\nIs ThatAlwaysthe Case?\nYears ago, I had a dog named Bugsy, who loved to play with most other dogs and generally had good social skills when off leash with them. However, I had to work very hard to manage him around toys or food because his natural inclination was to bepossessive of anythinghe considered valuable, and to act aggressively towards a dog or a person around his so-called treasures. Additionally, he would bark, growl, and lunge whenever he saw a dog while he was on a leash. To add to his list of issues, he showed signs of fearfulness in a lot of different situations.\nBugsy would move his tail in a circle wag when charging at other dogs who came onto our property. He would bark and stiffen — not signs of friendliness by any stretch of the imagination — but when he reached the dog, he would initiate play after a tense greeting. It is one of the few times I have seen a dog exhibit a circle wag when not in anobviouslyfriendly or happy mode, but he really did like playing with dogs, so maybe he was anticipating that? My guess is that he was in an ambivalent state — open to the possibility of a friendly encounter, but nervous about the other dog at the same time.\nSome dogs wag their tails in circles regularly, perhaps in response to any positive experience. Other dogs only do it at specific times, such as whengreeting their best dog buddy, when their guardian comes home after being away all day, or when they realize that it is time for a walk.\nThis body language is not as simple as you probably think.",

  },
  "page_content": "Taking an extended road trip with your pup can be filled with lifelong memories and tons of social media content, but it’s a different animal than zipping out of town for a short weekend at a pet-friendly cabin. I should know: I took my Golden Retriever on a seven-month, multi-country, four-wheeled adventure a few years back. Let’s just say I learned some things!\nFirst, get real about whether they should come.\nThis is perhaps the most important decision you’ll make. While it can be loads of fun to share a long trip, it can also be overwhelming for you and your dog. Does your dog get car sick? Spending months on the road is probably not their idea of a good time. Maybe a few long-term rentals are a better option, giving you and your dog a home base with far less time in the car. Do they have aggression challenges with other people or animals? While it’s not impossible to manage behavior on the road, it becomes more difficult. Are they prone to anxiety where such a dramatic change in their routine is likely to cause extreme stress? You will never regret thinking through these things in advance.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nOK, they’re coming! Now, plan your set-up.\nWhile converted vans are the trendiest option for life on the road, there are a lot of ways to see the country and stay comfortable and safe with your dog. I opted for a truck camper and a large pickup truck with a backseat. When we were on the road, Keira had a fancy setup in the backseat so she could chill comfortably and safely. Once we were settled somewhere for the night, we spent our time in the camper, which came equipped with a small kitchen, toilet, bed, and dining table. I opted for a camper without an indoor shower so I’d have more storage for my dog’s things. Sixty square feet is a tight fit, but living minimally and spending most of our time outdoors made it workable.\nAll the essentials you need to hit the road with your co-pilot, from dog seatbelts to crash-tested carriers.\nResearch your route.\nIf your motivation for a road trip is to visit cities and their museums, shows, or other indoor activities, you’ll need to plan where your dog will stay when you do things like that. Maybe you have a friend or family member who can pet sit for a bit, but each time you leave your dog somewhere new, it’s an added stress. Some extroverted dogs are built for this — they can’t wait to meet new people and wouldn’t even notice you were gone for a few hours — but most dogs will feel at least mildly anxious over being with new people and most short-term rentals frown on leaving your dog alone. If youhave a breed of dog that is traditionally discriminated against, you’ll have an additional barrier as many short-term rentals and campgrounds still prohibit certain dogs.\nAn outdoor-centered trip is typically easier on everyone. In seven months, Keira and I visited over 30 national parks and forests in the U.S. and Canada and broke up the trip by visiting family and friends along the way. If you focus your trip around state and national parks, be sure to check regulations. Some parks, like the Badlands in South Dakota, don’t allow dogs on many of the trails, while others, like Death Valley, are famously too hot for dogs to enjoy.\nIn both parks, I made sure to arrive early to get a site with electricity (and therefore, air conditioning) and then made friends with our RV neighbors who offered to check in on Keira while I was hiking. Travelers are often missing their own pets and will jump at the opportunity to spend time with your dog. If the campsites were full or I couldn’t find anyone to keep an eye on her, I was prepared to keep driving until I found a safer place for us.\nWhere to go and what to do—from Alabama to Wyoming.\nPrep your dog.\nTalk with your veterinarian to ensure your dog is up to date on all appropriate vaccinations and plan to print out your dog’s records, including their rabies certificate, which will be required if you need to use a boarding facility or to enter another country. Depending on where you plan to travel, there may be a need to protect them from diseases that are rare in your hometown but more prevalent in the places you’re visiting.\nIf you need to cross the border into Canada or Mexico, be sure to check international rules, which may include a health certificate issued within a week or two of your arrival – a tricky requirement if you’re many miles away from your regular veterinarian. As for all the various pet gear you’ll need: Before the big trip, take a few test runs with your dog, perhaps driving to a nearby campground to practice setting up and to see if you forgot to pack any important supplies.\nFinally, have a backup plan.\nYou’ve planned your setup, your tentative route, and prepared your dog, but you won’t really know how your dog will take things till you’re on the road. Plan ahead by asking a family member or friend if they’d be willing to care for your pup in the event things aren’t going well and save some extra funds to help offset potential petsitting costs. Rethinking your route and allowing for longer stays in fewer places may also be a solution. When I first set out, I planned to spend a year on the road but by late fall, it was becoming increasingly uncomfortable to sleep in the truck camper, so I headed home, where Keira and I spent the last three months of our sabbatical napping, eating, and hiking while I prepared to re-enter the workforce.\nLiving on the road can be a life-changing experience. By putting together a solid game plan, you can ensure your days are filled with more tail wags and fewer barks.",

If you find yourself thinking what was initially cute is quickly becoming excessive, especially if weight gain is involved, this may not be run-of-the-millsleepy pup syndrome. Instead, it could be a serious condition known as hypothyroidism.\nWhat is Hypothyroidism in Dogs?\nFluctuations in hormones caused by inflammation or shrinkage of the thyroid gland cause hypothyroidism in dogs. Primary hypothyroidism is the most common hormonal disorder in dogs. The average onset of hypothyroidism in dogs is at seven years old. It is often found in large breed dogs — Doberman Pinschers, Golden Retrievers, Irish Setters, Great Danes and Boxers — and some smaller types, including Cocker Spaniels, Dachshunds, Poodles and Miniature Schnauzers.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThe classic signs of hyperthyroidism in dogs include weight gain, lethargy, cold intolerance, skin and coat changes (yeasty-smelling fur; dark, lacy patches in the groin; excess shedding), vague and subtle symptoms that had snuck in slowly. Basically, a dog’s metabolism is working at a crawl.\nHypothyroid dogs tend to have elevated fasting cholesterol and triglycerides, elevated liver values, and mild anemia. Less often, they exhibit neurological weakness, poor appetite, corneal deposits, slow heart rate, heart arrhythmia, or infertility.\nWhile overproduction of thyroid hormones is often closely associated with cancer, it is rare in dogs. Rather, more than 95 percent of hypothyroid canine cases are caused by unknown gland atrophy or immune destruction of the thyroid. When damaged, the gland cannot respond as well to the TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) secreted from the pituitary gland to make T4 (levothyroxine) and T3 (triidothyronine), currency used by the body for the metabolism of energy.\nHow Do You Diagnose and Treat Hypothyroidism?\nOnce diagnosed, hypothyroid dogs tend to respond well to a long-term, twice-daily dosage protocol of oral levothyroxine. Typically, within four to six weeks, they have more energy, they lose weight and their coats begin to shine. After T4 levels normalize, some dogs can be transitioned to a once-a-day medication schedule.\nSometimes, however, a dog’s thyroid disorder is atypical — their blood work doesn’t match the signs or vice versa. A dog may be suffering from other illnesses that lower T4, and certain medications can decrease thyroid levels as well. Adding to the confusion, for some dogs — such as Sight Hounds, Basenjis, or athletic dogs — thyroid levels are normally low. So how do we know if a dog is truly hypothyroid?\nTo sort things out, veterinarians turn to what is currently the most thorough thyroid panel, offered by theMichigan State University Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health(DCPAH). Your vet may call this the “Michigan panel” though, even with it, the results are often less than crystal clear.\nThe Michigan panel evaluates TgAA (antithyroidglobulin antibodies), autoantibodies to the thyroid. A TgAA that is greater than 35 percent of the positive control value is positive for the presence of lymphocytic thyroiditis, but might not indicate full-blown hypothyroidism. According to DCPAH, “Positive values indicate thyroid gland pathology, and also tell us about the validity of the thyroid hormone results.” A caveat — TgAA can be elevated even when the dog is not yet truly hypothyroid. Because the gland must lose at least 60 percent of its function before clinical signs can be observed — which can take years, or may never happen — retesting a dog every six to 12 months is recommended.\nTo further define the results, DCPAH recommends testing fT4ED (free T4 by equilibrium dialysis) when “T4AA [a subset of TgAA] have been documented, non-thyroidal illness is known to be present, or the dog has received interfering substances such as steroids or phenobarbital.”\nSome medications lower T4 levels like phenobarbital, trimethoprim-sulfonamide, zonisamide, clomipramine and any glucocorticoid (drugs that stop inflammation, such as oral or topicals for ears, eyes and skin). So, if your dog is being given one of these medications, one way to clarify blood results is to work with your vet to safely wean him off the medication. After halting the medication for the prescribed period, blood work can be rechecked. If it’s not possible to stop a medication, a six-to-eight-week levothyroxine trial is sometimes employed.\nIn the end, after all the grey areas and questions, hypothyroidism comes down to this: treat the dog, not the blood work. Your dog’s vet can help you sort through the diagnostics and set up an appropriate monitoring schedule. Until then, don’t sleep on the warning signs.\nThe Michigan Thyroid Panel measures many aspects of thyroid function. Here’s a tip sheet for decoding the results of your dog's hypothyroid test.\nTT4:Total T4 measures both protein-bound and free T4 levels. Various tissues convert free T4 to T3 to be used by the body. T4 is commonly decreased in hypothyroid dogs, but concurrent illness and many drugs can also falsely lower it. However, if it is normal, it is very unlikely that the dog is hypothyroid, and no further testing is necessary.\nfT4:Free T4 measures T4 not bound by protein (the form that’s converted to T3). It is often decreased in hypothyroid dogs. Concurrent illness and drugs can lower it.\nfT4ED:Free T4 by equilibrium dialysis (rather than by direct radioimmunoassay, or RIA), separates the free T4 from protein-bound T4.The dialysate, which is the part of a mixture that passes through the membrane in dialysis (containing the free T4), is then assessed by RIA. The fT4ED is less affected by seizure medications, steroids and euthyroid illness, but it cannot be used to clarify ambiguities when a dog is on sulfa drugs. It is not affected by the presence of TgAA.\nTotal T3, reverse T3 and free T3:Free T3 is the active form of thyroid, converted from free T4 to be used by the body. Because they fluctuate independently of hypothyroid status, T3 results are less reliable indicators of hypothyroidism.\nTSH:Thyroid-stimulating hormone is secreted by the pituitary to stimulate T4 when T4 is low from true thyroid disease, certain medications, systemic illness and levothyroxine withdrawal; 85 percent of hypothyroid dogs with low TT4 will have elevated TSH; those who do not make it harder to confirm the diagnosis.\nTgAA:Antithyroidglobulin antibodies, which, when present at greater than 35 percent, suggest immune-mediated thyroiditis. These antibodies can affect TT4 and free T4 results, complicating diagnosis. Hypothyroidism may not be currently present, and it may or may not develop in the future.",

  "page_content": "It’s a beautiful summer day. You and your dog are walking near a patch of grass when they stop dead, then sniff and keep sniffing. Gently, you tug on the leash, but — muzzle buried in the turf — they brace themselves and continue theirnosework.\nScent is extremely important to dogs, much more so than to humans. All dogs have smart noses. In fact, MRI studies show that when a dog recognizes the smell of a familiar human, the caudate nucleus in her brain lights up, signaling a happy event. For the average dog, a small pile of foliage contains a world of information. Though the canine brain is about one-tenth the size of a human brain, its smell center is 40 times larger. We have roughly five to six million scent receptors, a fraction of the 125 to 300 million available to our canine companions.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nFirstly, This Is How Dog Noses Work\nTheir moist noses are cute, but there’s function behind that soft form. The mucus on a dog’s nose helps capture scent particles. When a dog’s nose is dry, they may lick it to improve reception. Dogs can also wiggle their nostrils independently, thereby detecting the direction of odors.\nDespite the fact that the olfactory system is an ancient neurological pathway, we still do not completely understand how it works, either in ourselves or in our dogs. However, enough studies have shown it is critical to the survival of species across the animal kingdom — especially dogs.\nHow Scents Influence Human Behavior\nThough we may not understand it, most of us are aware that scent can influence behavior. In the realm of human holistic treatments, the use of essential oils and herbal fragrances has become increasingly trendy, and yoga teachers will sometimes use aromatic oils during classes.\nExposure to certain herbal or spice scents has been shown to have positive effects on humans. For example, Mark Moss and Lorraine Oliver, working at the Brain Performance and Nutrition Research Centre at Northumbria University in the UK, designed an experiment to investigate the pharmacology of 1,8-cineole, one of the main components of rosemary.\nBrb, running out to buy air plants and succulents.\nAfter exposing 20 human subjects to varying levels of 1,8-cineole, the investigators tested their cognitive performance. Speed and accuracy test results showed that the concentration of 1,8-cineole in the blood was related to an individual’s cognitive performance: higher concentrations resulted in increased speed and accuracy. If scent can have positive effects on olfactory challenged humans, it might be expected to have an even more pronounced effect on dogs.\nHow Scents Influence Dog Behavior\nWhile research on canines is limited, astudydone at the University of Belfast explored the influence of four types of olfactory stimulation (lavender,chamomile, rosemary and peppermint) on the behavior of 55 dogs housed in a rescue shelter. The control condition used no odors other than those arising naturally from the dogs’ environment (e.g., odors from disinfectants and other animals). Using diffusions of essential oils and allowing two days between stimulants, the dogs were exposed to the scents four hours a day for five days.\nAccording to the study, dogs exposed to lavender and chamomile spent more time resting and less time moving than with other olfactory stimuli used in the experiment. These odorants were also found to reduce barking and vocalization in caged animals. On the other hand, fragrances such as rosemary and peppermint were found to encourage significantly more standing, moving, and vocalizing.\nHow Scent Enrichment Helps Shelter Dogs\nShelters are safe but sterile environments, and, recognizing that as an issue, some have looked for ways to enrich those environments for their animals. With that in mind, an increasing number are introducing scents. For example, the Humane Society of Miami used a scent enrichment program, which incorporated essential oils such as lavender and vanilla.\nMcKamey Animal Center, located in Chattanooga, TN, is among the few that have worked with scent enrichment for several years, according to Morag Greaney, the center’s former adoption and foster supervisor. According to Greaney, the scents — which include lavender, vanilla, and rosemary — are changed every day. The essential oil was mixed with water, then sprayed on the ground outside the dog kennels using nonaerosol methods. While there wasn’t an immediate reaction, staff observed that the animals tended to be calmer and more settled the following day. Greaney believes that it is not just a particular scent that makes a difference (although she does find thatlavender has a calming effect), but the variety that helps stimulate the dogs’ brains.\nThe center, which handles upwards of 200 animals, hosts a number of different breeds — Huskies, Labradors, German Shepherds, and Pit Bull-type dogs — among them. While the center hasn’t conducted any formal studies to determine if different breeds are affected differently by the scents, its behavior-assessment team uses lavender to help relax new animals prior to evaluation.\nHere’s why you shouldn’t rule out senior dogs, special-needs pups, bully breeds, or tripods.\nThe results of these small studies may be promising to help reduce the stress of shelter animals, but more research is needed on the safety of using essential oils more broadly with pets.\nShould You Use Essential Oils at Home?\nScent enrichment, in tandem with other stress relief techniques, may work at home with guidance from your veterinarian. “I would absolutely recommend that dog owners use scents with their animals,” says Greaney. However, she cautioned that people should first do some preliminary research and check with their veterinarian to avoid any possible detrimental effects—that’s because manyessential oils are toxic to pets. What may be safe for dogs can be fatal for cats and vice versa, while others are poisonous to both species.\nAccording toASPCAAnimal Poison Control Center (APCC), “Using an oil diffuser for a short time period in a secured area— one that your dog or cat cannot access—is not likely to be an issue.” The ASPCA also has a helpful list oftoxic and non-toxic plantsandpro tipson using essential oils, which you can refer to alongside your veterinarian to determine if any essential oils could benefit your dog.\nDisclaimer alert: This article is here to share information, but more research needs to be done. So, don’t take this as medical advice. Talk things over with your vet when making decisions, and use your best judgment.",

  "page_content": "Your dog is not mysterious about how they feel. When you get home, they greet you at the door with kisses. When you lace up your shoes, they try to lure you back with a request for belly rubs because they’re sad you’re leaving. But here’s one thing you can’t so easily tell from your dog: how they’ll behave based on their breed.\nPeopleoften cite breedwhen trying to account for the ways dogs behave. But according to Christine Hibbard, owner ofCompanion Animal Solutionsin Seattle, when associating a dog with the “look” or “behavior” of a particular breed, it’s important to remember that “the way dogs look and their actual genetics can be very different.” That, at least, is what studies are showing. As Dr. Victoria Voith, a veterinary behaviorist at Western University of Health Sciences explains, “Mixed breed dogs are a collage of features of their ancestors. So much so that they often don’t look like any of their immediate parents or grandparents. In fact, they may look more like other breeds.”\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nNo Two Dogs Alike\nDNA tests often reveal that dogs are not simply a cross between two purebred parents. Instead, tests often come back with percentages of varying breeds — many of which you could have never guessed by appearance. Since a dog’s looks and their genetic code can be on very different pages — sometimes in different books altogether — attributing a dog’s behavior to their “look” can sometimes be a faulty assumption.\nThis even applies to purebred dogs to a degree despite their concentrated breeding pools.  The AKC and other breed-certifying organizations certainly ascribe global attributes to breeds, but they are simply guidelines. As Denise Herman, lead trainer and founder of Empire of the Dog in NYC, says, “When you get a puppy of a particular breed, people think it’s a blank slate, but it’s really an unknown slate. Breed gives an indication of where that unknown slate may go, but not all Border Collies herd, not all Huskies pull sleds and some Chows like everyone equally. A puppy of a particular breed is an unknown slate with the possibility of those characteristics.”\nWhile genetics get a dog started, developmental factors such as environment, learning and individual life experiences make each dog who they are. No two dogs on the planet will have the exact same life experiences, which means no two dogs, even of the same breed, will have the exact same personality or responses to similar situations. However, the means of expressing those reactions can very much be related to physical attributes.\nMixed Signals\nAccording to Dr. Stephen Zawistowski, science advisor to the ASPCA, “There are some things that are anatomically not possible for a dog to do. How can you tell if a Basset Hound has their ears up and forward? A Rottweiler can make a great lip pucker, but how on earth can a Bulldog pucker?” To be sure, the lack of overt behavioral signals does not suggest a dog is not feeling a particular emotion, or even that they might not adopt different strategies to convey them. But the implication is clear: The perception that Rottweilers are aggressive and Basset Hounds are laid-back could be a function of their physical features — and thus, the behaviors they can perform — rather than their mental processes.\nWith this in mind, could a dog’s physical appearance affect how they communicate? Or even, for that matter, how they’re treated by other members of their species? Dr. Jim Ha, research associate professor and staff member of Companion Animal Solutions in Seattle breaks it down. “The way dogs look — their morphology — can definitely change the quality of their visual signal,” he explains. “Dogs who are more infantile in appearance — paedomorphic dogs like French Bulldogs, Pugs and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels — are nice examples of how we are handicapping the dog’s ability to signal properly. But we also find that dogs who are not paedomorphic in appearance can have trouble signaling and communicating with one another as well. Signaling difficulty is not only associated with paedomorphic dogs.”\nImpact of Docked Tails\nHa suggests that many aggression issues stem from the misuse of signals and miscommunication between dogs. A prime example is dog tails come in a spectrum of shapes and sizes. When asked to assess dog behavior, humans tend to pay an inordinate amount ofattention to the tail. But is the same true for dog-to-dog communication?\nWhen researchers with the journalBehavioral and Brain Functionsexplored how dogs respond to other dogs’ tails, they pulled out the big guns: a model robot resembling a Labrador Retriever. Apart from its tail, the “dog” was motionless. The researchers found that when the bot had a long wagging tail, it was approached more than when it had a long still tail — which as you probably assumed, suggests that the tail conveys emotional state, and that wagging is more inviting than not wagging.\nWhen it came to short tails, the story changed. There was no difference between how the robot dog with a short/still and a short/wagging tail was approached. It appears that the longer tails were most effective at conveying emotional information, and since short tails are hard to read, they might not be read at all.\nFor Herman, the implications are obvious. “When you dock tails, it takes away part of their communication signal — essentially the dog version of botox. Ear cropping falls in the same category. Dobermans with cropped ears ostensibly look alert to other dogs. They can’t be read [accurately] because they can’t change.” It’s difficult to derive cues and information from cropped ears. If anything, their constantly alert position could mislead other dogs.\nE’Lise Christensen, a board-certified veterinary behaviorist in New York City, agrees, “I think cosmetic alteration could affect communication with other dogs. It certainly [has an impact on] assessments by owners, because they forget to look at the stump of the tail for movement and tension. Ears that are too cropped mean owners have to look for muscular movement at the skull level rather than the pinna, the outer part of the ear, where we customarily look. Flat faces make it more difficult to read small muscular movements.”\nHerman suggests that taking note of a dog’s morphology can give pet parents a better appreciation for their dog. “It’s hard for other dogs to see that a Chow is really stiff, simply because they are [engulfed] in a ball of hair. It can be helpful for dog parents to recognize that what dogs have or do not have at their disposal could add confusion to dog-dog communication. This appreciation could help people empathize with their dog, instead of blaming their dog or feeling angry for the dog’s behavior.”\nHibbard reminds us that the issue at hand can be twofold, “If you can’t see the ears, that’s one problem. But if you can see the ears but the dog uses them wrong, that’s another problem.”\nIt’s All About Us\nNo dog story is complete without the human element. Many pet professionals believe there should be guidelines or legislation set for these cosmetic alterations. TheAmerican Veterinary Medical Associationand theAmerican Animal Hospital Associationoppose ear cropping and tail-docking for cosmetic purposes. Each states that the procedure causes dogs pain and distress and runs risks of complications, hemorrhage and infection. Across the pond, manyEuropean nations banned these practices in 1987. In the UK, tail docking is considered to be mutilation where it was banned in 2007 with an exemption for some working dogs.\nWhile there are many who oppose cropping and docking, others downplay the concern. Members of the American Kennel Club and breeders line up to defend docking, which they call an acceptable practice “integral to defining and preserving breed character, enhancing good health, and preventing injuries.” While opposing a New York State bill banning tail docking, the AKC claimed, “an intact tail at full-length would result in injured and bloodied tails when the dogs perform the functions for which they were bred.”\nCurrently, Maryland and Pennsylvania are the only states in the U.S. that have somerestrictions on the tail docking of dogs. But these laws are more about basic humane practices than anything else. Maryland’s law stipulates that the procedure must be performed by a licensed veterinarian with anesthesia. On the other hand, Pennsylvania law prohibits the average person from docking their dog’s tail after five days of age. Veterinarians are required to wait until 12-weeks and use anesthesia — unless it is “medically necessary” to do so earlier.\nAside from the health consequences, what do we do to a dog’s ability to speak to us when we cut off this important communication tool? Could morphology play a role in the way dogs and humans interact? Dogs excel at being in sync with us, whether on the agility course or when they’re trying to figure out if we’re going into the bathroom versus the far more enticing kitchen. But not unlike the chemistry in a long-term relationship, sometimes dogs are out of sync.\nTraining, life experience, genetics and psychological disorders are the common suspects for “out-of-sync” behavior, but how a dog looks — or rather, sees — is often overlooked. In 2003, professor Paul McGreevy, a researcher at the University of Sydney, and his colleagues discovered that, contrary to popular belief,all canine eyes are not the same. Short-nosed dogs have what is called an area centralis, which allows them to focus more clearly on the world in front of them, like humans, while long-nosed dogs have a visual streak, which enables better peripheral vision. There’s a physiological reason why a long-nosed dog would take off after something way in the periphery while you and a short-nosed dog continue to sit on a park bench wondering what the long-nosed dog saw.\nIt stands to reason that these differences would not only affect how dogs see the world around them, but also how they attend to us humans, and that’s exactly what we find. Dogs are quite adept at following our pointing gestures, but brachycephalic (flat-faced) breeds, with their more forward-facing eyes, follow these gestures better than dolichocephalic (long-nosed) breeds. In turn, this sense of being seen and responded to accordingly (or not) may affect how we perceive and relate to dogs.\nUndoubtedly, dogs are a composite of their genes and individual life experiences. But the physical features that they come with, or that we give them via docking and breeding, can contribute to how they interact with others and are perceived by dogs and humans alike. When thinking about why your dog behaves the way they do, it’s one of the few instances that where it can be helpful to be superficial and look at what’s right in front of you.",

  "page_content": "You probably see your dog’s tail wag as a display of excitement, but did you know the movement can actually reveal a range of canine emotions? That’s why dog trainers and behaviorists (like myself) are constantly watching to see if a tail swings higher to the right or left — the asymmetrical motion indicates whether a dog is using the left or right hemisphere of their brain, which is a window into their emotions. But what about a dog’s dominant paw preference?\nYep, the idea behind this type of lateralization (preferring one side of the body over the other) extends far beyond matters of scissors and can-openers (people) and learning to shake (dogs). There are actually strong links between paw preference, the strength of that preference, and a dog’s behavior and emotional life. Let’s look at how adog’s tail wagand dominant paw preference clue us into their personality and emotions.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nConnecting Paw Preference and Your Dog's Emotions\nAstudyfound that the direction of a dog’s tail wag depended on the stimuli. Dogs wagged higher to the right when greeting their humans; when they met unfamiliar people, the same right-side bias was seen — but at a lower angle. In response to cats, there was little wagging, but it was still higher to the right. The only stimulus that elicited a left-sided wag was an unfamiliar, confident dog. But why?\nAsymmetrical tail wags reflect how the two sides of a dog’s brain process information and control their body. The right hemisphere reigns over the left side of the body, and the left hemisphere, the right side. So, for example, when dogs wag their tails to the right, they’re more intensely engaging muscles on the right side of their body, which means the left hemisphere is activated.\nThe left hemisphere is responsible for positive experiences and emotions including happiness, affection, and excitement, as well as anything familiar. The right hemisphere is in charge of processing sadness, fear, or other negative emotions and new things.\nThis link between emotions and sides of the brain originally came to light in studies of humans. Onestudyasked participants questions that elicited either positive or negative emotions, and they looked to their right (engaging the left brain hemisphere) in response to positive questions and to their left (engaging the right hemisphere) in response to negative questions. Similar lateralization — or a function’s localization to one side of the body — has since been found in fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, primates and other mammals.\nSo, it makes sense that individuals — canine or human — who favor the left paw or hand use the right hemisphere of their brain more often, while right-pawed and right-handed individuals have a more active left-brain hemisphere. Studies have shown differences between right-pawed and left-pawed dogs. They have also revealed that dogs who are ambilateral — who don’t have a paw preference — are different in predictable ways from dogs who strongly prefer one paw over the other.\nIs Your Dog a Righty or a Lefty?\nIn humans, we identify hand preference based on which hand a person uses to eat and write, or by seeing who keeps their arms tucked in tight when eating at a small round table. (It’s the lefties, because they’re used to colliding with the righties next to them.) In dogs, most determinations are based on the “Kong test,” in which dogs are observed extracting food from aKongtoy. Every time the dog uses a paw to stabilize the Kong, the observer records which paw is used. If the dog uses both paws simultaneously, that is also recorded, and all data is combined to determine paw preference and strength. There are approximately equal numbers of left-pawed, right-pawed, and ambilateral dogs, which is far different from humans, the majority of whom are righties.\nOur dogs’ paw preferences provide insight beyond Kong play, though. Onestudyfound that being right-pawed was associated with lower arousal and calmer responses to new experiences and strangers. Anotherstudyfound that dogs who were left-pawed exhibited more stranger-directed aggression than dogs who were either right-pawed or ambilateral. Many potential guide dogs fail their training — usually for behavioral reasons — and pastresearchhas documented higher success rates of right-pawed than left-pawed dogs in training programs.\nWhat Your Dog's Dominant Paw Preference May Mean\nPaw preference alone has an affect on dogs’ emotions and behavior, but the preference’s strength also plays a part. For example, onestudydemonstrated that dogs without a paw preference were more reactive to loud noises than dogs with a paw preference. Research has also shown that dogs with stronger paw preferences were bolder and less cautious than dogs with weaker paw preferences. They were also more confident, less prone toarousalandanxiety, quicker to relax or become playful in new environments, and exhibited calmer responses to new experiences and strangers.\nIt turns out that we humans are similar to our best friends in this regard: People with weak hand preferences are more likely to suffer high anxiety levels and are more susceptible to bothPTSDand psychosis than those with a strong handedness.\nAnd when it comes to guide dogs, just as being right-pawed predicted their training success, dogs with a strong lateralization (either left or right) and low rate of using both paws in the Kong test fared better. This may be because, according toresearch, strongly lateralized and right-pawed dogs are less likely to experience high reactivity and distress responses — two requirements of a good guide dog.\nInstudiesof sensory processes and lateralization, dogs were simultaneously presented with identical stimuli on both their left and right sides while eating from a bowl. The direction they turned their heads indicated which side of the brain was involved in processing and responding to the stimulus, revealing the dogs’ emotional reaction to it.\nIn response to the social cues of canine isolation, disturbance calls, and playvocalizations, dogs consistently turned to the right (involving the emotionally positive left-brain hemisphere), but they tended to turn left (showing activation of the emotionally negative right-brain hemisphere) when they heard thunder.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nDogs also turned left in response to images of cats andsnakes, but not to images of dogs. With repeated presentations, there was a change toward right-turning behavior, indicating that the left side of the brain and its associated positive emotions were involved. This suggests that novelty may be a factor in fear and other intense negative emotions that are processed by the right side of the brain.\nThese patterns aren’t limited to the head and paws, either. Other studies have revealed dogs’ nostrils role in processing — after all, the left and right nostrils are connected to their respective hemispheres. In onestudy, dogs started to sniff new, but non-aversive stimuli (food,lemon, dog secretions) with their right nostril and then shifted with repetition to using their left nostril, showing a change from negative to positive emotions. When presented with adrenaline and sweat from their vets (yes, really!), they demonstrated a consistent bias toward the right nostril, suggesting that their emotions started and remained negative in response to these odors.\nWhy Your Dog's Paw Preference Matters\nOur understanding of lateralization has potential to improve dogs’ quality of life, ourrelationshipswith them, and even our success in training them. We may be able to reduce stress by approaching dogs from their right side in exams, during greetings, or in any stressful situations. We can quickly see how dogs react emotionally to a variety of stimuli by paying attention to which way they turn, and we can observe the asymmetry in their tail wags to gauge their emotional state.\nIt’s possible that we can even minimize the development of noise phobias by placing dogs whose lateralization suggests vulnerability in quieter homes. We can minimize the substantial investment of time and money spent on training guide dogs by training only those who have the greatest chance of completing the program.\nIt’s all part of getting to know our dogs better, which breeds even more love for them (if that’s possible!). A dear dog friend of mine is strongly right-pawed; it was once pitiful to watch him attempt a left high-five, or use his left paw to hold his Kong when he briefly had a bandage on his right. I used to find his struggle somewhat comical. Now I understand that this trait is part of the package that makes him the unflappable, happy, playful, exploratory, unfazed kind of dog I love so much. I’m honored and overjoyed that when he greets me, his tail wags are as right-sided as the rest of him.",

  "page_content": "Dogs tend to live in the moment, accepting each treat, snuggle, or toss of the tennis ball as the sole reason for their existence with a charming single-mindedness. Yet their understanding of time can be complex. Many dogs are able to anticipate predictable events accurately, which is why they leap on the couch to look out the window when the kids are just about to come home from school or adults are nearly home from work. Even more dogs appear to know, from their own stomach’s rumblings, that the dinner hour fast approaches (or, in many cases, that dinner is supposed to be in precisely 58 minutes!). And according tothe New York Timesbest-selling author and dog cognition researcher, Alexandra Horowitz, “Dogs smell time.”\nWhat Does it Mean to Smell Time?\nUnlike humans, who experience the world visually, dogs detect changes to their environment, including who has been there and for how long, through their impeccable sense of smell. This allows them to make predictions about the future based on patterns they’ve sniffed out (no pun intended). Kind of like a game of memory, but for your schnoz. Or as Horowitz puts it in her book,Being a Dog: Following the Dog Into a World of Smell, pups’ powerful noses allow them to perceive the passage of time.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThat’s not to say our dogs are mystical or otherworldly; it’s just that dogs can understand much about the past because of their extreme sensitivity to smell. Odors change over time, sometimes predictably. When you leave the house to go to work each day, the smell of you in the house decreases with each hour of your absence, and your dog can detect the difference. Perhaps your dog has learned through repetition that when the smell of you has weakened to a specific degree, you come home. In other words, the strength of your odor predicts the time of your return. So, if you thought no one noticed that new fragrance you’ve been trying out, think again.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nHow Do Dogs Smell Time?\nThis degree of scent discrimination is not hard for most dogs. Many dogs can, for example, tell which way to follow a scent trail by heading from where it is weakest (less recent) to where it is strongest (most recent) even when the difference is minuscule. When dogs smell weak odors, they are perceiving events of the past. Because dogs can detect both new and old odors, they are perceiving events and substances across intervals of time.\nEach day, even in the same place, smells help dogs understand the passage of time. As air heats up over the course of the day, air currents change and move around in space, taking the molecules responsible for odors with them. Dogs, with their sensitive noses and large olfactory lobes, are able to sense the movement and presence of chemicals people barely detect if at all. Though we humans may detect daily patterns in light or even sound, our ability to smell clues about the passage of time is barely perceptible. Yet, dogs detect odors that reveal past happenings in complex ways we are only beginning to understand.\nIf we needed further evidence that our dogs are intelligent, complex beings, Horowitz’s cognition studies can provide just that. Dogs have “hundreds of millions more” scent receptor cells than we do, which is “probably partially responsible for their increased acuity,” she concludes.",

  "page_content": "Last week, a client described his dog by saying, “He’s wonderful! The kids can doanythingto him!” When I hear such comments — which, as an animal behaviorist and dog trainer, I often do — my first thought isI need to know what the kids are doing to that poor dog. Usually, “anything” entails climbing on the dog, pulling their ears or poking them in the eyes, dragging them by the tail, tossing them off the couch, chewing on their toys...the list goes on.\nThese are things you could reasonably expect to bother even the most patient dog. The average human facing similar situations would likely lose their temper and, quite possibly, lash out. (I’ve sometimes wondered why dogs don’t do so more often.) In my experience, anger is quite rare among dogs — and since aggressive dogs are my business, that’s saying something.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nDogs and Anger\nThe idea that a dog is capable of becoming angry troubles many people, which makes grappling with the concept difficult. There’s a tendency to ascribe only positive emotions to our dogs. We’re quite comfortable with the idea that dogs feel happiness or love, but we have a harder time getting our minds around the idea that dogs might also feel hate or anger.\nThere is evidence that this may be especially true of people who have spent a lot of time with dogs. A 2013 study that classified dogs’ facial expressions from photographs found that people who were inexperienced with dogs were better at identifying canine anger than those who were experienced. The authors suggest that perhaps experienced people were more likely to give dogs the benefit of the doubt and perceive them to be friendly rather than aggressive.\nWhile it does not surprise me that many people have a hard time believing that dogs can get angry, studies on dogs’ (and other animals’) emotions suggest that they have a fuller emotional life than we once thought. If they can experience fear, love, joy, sadness, and grief — why not anger?\nDo Angry Dogs Bite?\nWhy should we worry about whether dogs do or do not experience anger? Part of the answer is that to know dogs, we have to understand the full range of their emotions. Another issue is that when pushed beyond the limits of their control, dogs may express their anger in a very problematic way: with abite.\nThough aggression is common in my line of work, I am often amazed at how relatively rarely dogs bite. Janis Bradley, in the Animals and Society Institute’s policy paper,Dog Bites: Problems and Solutions, noted that — according to CDC statistics, which are gleaned from hospital ERs — the average is 11 bites per 10,000 people. More than one-third of U.S. households include at least one dog, which means that, at a minimum, roughly 113 million people are in daily contact with dogs. Of all those interactions, only a very small percentage result in a bite. More exactly, Bradley wrote, dog bites account for 0.1 percent of all emergency room visits, and 99% of those are rated as “level 1 injuries,” or the least severe of six categories.\nDon’t get me wrong: Dog bites are still too common, and I’m certainly in favor of all efforts to decrease their frequency. I’m also well aware that far too many people have been scared, injured, or traumatized by an experience with canine aggression. Yet, when you consider how often dogs have an opportunity to bite but don’t, it’s pretty remarkable.\nDo Dogs Get Angry?\nThere is compelling biological evidence to support the idea that dogs do indeed experience anger. Jaak Panksepp, who wrote the amazing bookAffective Neuroscience: The Foundations of Human and Animal Emotions, considered anger to be one of the core mammalian emotions. Also, anger is quite primitive, which makes it hard to argue that only humans feel it.\nBiologically speaking, we have many things in common with our dogs, including the anatomy of our brains (particularly the amygdala, which plays important roles in both fear and anger) and the chemistry of our neurological systems (dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin, for example). Additionally, we share many facial expressions that relate to emotion, as Charles Darwin wrote about extensively in his 1872 book,The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals.\nMild forms of anger are called irritation or frustration, and the most extreme forms are referred to as rage, but they are all versions of the same emotion. Anger prepares the body — including the brain — for action, especially fighting, and has long been necessary for survival in many species. And because anger affects us physically, it is difficult to calm down once we become angry — it requires considerable emotional control to override the desire to act upon it. (That explains why it can be hard to resist kicking something when we are really, intensely angry.)\nAsk a Vet\nPet health question that’snotan emergency? Our vet team will answer over email within 48 hours. So, go ahead, ask us about weird poop, bad breath, and everything in between.\nI have observed dogs whose behavior is easier to understand in the context of being angry. For example, I’ve seen a few dogs display what looked to me like temper tantrums. An angry dog losing their temper and having a tantrum sounds ridiculously anthropomorphic until you see a dog in such a state. I recall an American Water Spaniel named Jonas doing just that — frothing at the mouth, jerking at the leash, and stamping his feet because he couldn’t reach a toy that had gone under a dense bush, then redirecting a bite to an innocent bystander. For Jonas, these behaviors were routine, not actions that only occasionally surfaced when he was having a bad day.\nAnother client came to me with her Pomeranian / Shih Tzu mix, who was wearing an Elizabethan collar and was mad about it. Her emotional response and behavior reflected her feelings. She glared, was disagreeable about responding to cues, and donkey kicked at the doors and furniture.\nStill, in the 20 years I’ve worked with aggressive dogs, I’ve only seen dogs who seemed to be truly angry a few dozen times. That means that, even among dogs with serious behavioral issues, it presents itself a couple of times a year. (On the other hand, I see the mild version of this emotion in the form of irritation or annoyance quite frequently — at least weekly.)\nThe Difference Between Anger and Aggression\nWhile some people think dogs can’t get angry, others have the impression that all dogs who act aggressively are angry. Although they can occur simultaneously, anger and aggression are not synonymous. Anger is an emotion; aggression is an action. They may go together, but they are not the same thing. Certainly, aggression can be a result of anger, but it’s rare. I thank my lucky stars that I seldom encounter dogs who are aggressive in anger, because those dogs are very hard to help. Similar to humans with bad tempers, they may learn to better control their behavior, but few are able to keep it under wraps permanently and completely.\nWhen a dog behaves aggressively, there’s always a lot of speculation about the reasons. It’s my experience that some factors are assumed to be common, even when — like anger — they are quite rare.Fearis by far the most common cause; roughly 80% of the aggressive dogs I see exhibit fear-based aggression. It may not be the only factor, but it is typically the main issue. This is actually good news because if we can help them overcome their fears, these dogs can significantly improve their behavior. Generally, fear as the cause of aggression is a positive indicator that behavior modification is likely to be successful.\nAggression most commonly develops gradually in young oradolescent dogs, and it’s typical to see the warning signs of impending trouble over weeks, months, or even years. Among the signals: a tense dog will freeze, their mouth will close, and their jaw will tighten; if something in the situation does not change, an aggressive response, including a bite, may follow. This is not as obvious as snapping, barking, growling, lunging, or showing teeth, but it’s a warning nevertheless — and it’s easy to spot if you know to look for it and understand what it means. Other, more subtle warning signs include behaviors like putting a paw or body between a toy and anyone approaching; a lack of normal friendliness; a wrinkled brow; and signs of fear or stress, including tongue flicks, yawning, whimpering, sweaty paws, or tail-tucking.\nAggression exhibited by a fully mature dog with no warning is oftenprovoked by pain. I remember two cases in which dogs really did bite out of the blue. One was a dog with a serious injury to his tooth, and the other involved a dog who suddenly began to attack the household’s other dog, who he had happily lived and played with for years; it turned out that he had an undiagnosed back injury. In both cases, the dogs acted aggressively to prevent themselves from being touched in ways that would cause them to experience more pain.\nAnother uncommon scenario is the dog who “misses” when they try to bite. Yes, people can sometimes move fast enough as a dog is lunging at them. The thing is, though, dogs’ reaction times are many times faster than humans’. When dogs choose to bite, bite they do. I’m sure there are examples of dogs who do actually flat-out miss, but it is far less common than many people think. So, chances are that if it looks like a dog tried to bite you and missed, it wasn’t because you were fast enough to avoid their teeth. It was probably just a warning. If they wanted to bite you, they would.",

  "page_content": "When it comes to playing with dogs, many strong opinions exist — especially around what youshouldn’tdo. While I agree with some of these prohibitions, there are three common dog play “don’ts” that are in fact myths. Below, let’s bust them one by one. Just remember to read to the end for the real “don’ts.”\nDog PlayDos\nBusting the top 3 myths...\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThe Truth: It’s actually great to incorporate play into dog training sessions. The best dog training occurs when the dog views an activity as a game rather than a lesson. Using chase games to teach recalls, playing follow to build a base for heeling, using tug to practice “take it” and “drop it,” and practicing stays with “find it” games or hide-and-seek are all great ways to blend training and play. Additionally, play is reinforcing, so playing with your dog may be better than the best treat.\nThe Truth: Dogs and people remain playful into adulthood, which may partially explain why we’ve been best friends for thousands of years. Many older dogs stop playing only because they no longer have buddies to play with. Keep playing with your dog well into old age. It’s part of what makes them dogs and us human.\nThe Truth: Tug is a great game for most dogs, and they can learn a lot from playing it. Many trainers share this view and actually teach tug in puppy classes. The earlier dogs learn the lessons that tug has to offer — such as impulse control, mouth control and cooperation as well as skills like “take it” and “drop it” — the safer and more fun the game becomes.\nFor a long time, experts advised against playing tug with dogs for fear that it would create or increase aggressiveness in dogs. Later, tug was considered fine for most dogs as long as they were not allowed to “win” by keeping the toy at the end. The concern was that there would be bad consequences if a dog felt they had just triumphed over the person.\nAscientific studyby Nicola Rooney and John Bradshaw addressed this issue. They found that “winning” the toy in a game of tug had no impact on the relationship between the human and dog. Based on their research, though, you should still be thoughtful about letting certain dogs keep the toy after a tug game. The most playful dogs in the study exhibited significantly higher amounts of playful attention-seeking behavior when they were allowed to “win.” Therefore, it may be better not to allow those dogs who become relentlessly pushy about seeking more play time to “win” at tug.\nOf course, for a few dogs, tug is a bad idea.Dogs who are prone to aggression induced by high arousal are not good candidates for it. The same warning applies to dogs with poor bite inhibition or poor self-control as well as those who tend to creep up the toy with their mouths during tug. Additionally, it may exacerbateresource-guarding behavior in dogswho already exhibit it.\nFor most dogs though, tug has many benefits. It is interactive and requires cooperation between humans and dogs. It can give dogs exercise and help them stretch their bodies prior to other activities such as running or agility training. Tug can effectively rev up an agility dog for maximum success on the course. It helps many dogs learn better mouth control in general.\nSpice Girlsreference aside, just because your dog is graying around the eyes doesn’t mean those eyes don’t light up at playtime.\nDog PlayDon’ts\nI stand by the ban on rough-and-tumble wrestle play between dogs and humans and the teasing that often accompanies it. Though wrestle play between dogs and humans can be fun, the high emotional arousal that results often leads to a lack of inhibition, and that’s when trouble can happen — even to nice dogs and nice people.\nThe reason: The play style used in wrestling is also used in serious fights and predation. Rough play is typically okay for play between dogs but can create real danger with people. When you (or your nephew or the little girl who lives next door) are down on the ground with your face next to an excited predator with dangerous weapons in their mouth,serious bitescan happen, even if the dog has never bitten before. All too often, I’ve seen shocked and devastated families crying in my office, and I don’t want that to happen to you.\nI’m also opposed to people chasing dogs, preferring to let dogs chase people instead. If you chase your dog, you risk teaching your dog that moving toward them means the game is afoot, making them more likely to run away even when you approach them for another reason. This can ruin your dog’s recall.\nChasing your dog can also lead to injury if your dog charges away from you into the street or another unsafe area. There’s no denying that letting a person chase a dog can be a great reinforcement for the dog, but I only approve this game for dogs who are so well-trained that the person can stop the game at any time and successfully call the dog to come.\nWith so many “do’s and don’ts” on how to play with dogs, the most important may be this: Don’tspend so much time worrying about playing with your dog that you don’t actually play with them!",

  "page_content": "As animal behavior researchers, we have been studying dog play for more than 10 years. Together with our colleagues, we have analyzed hundreds of hours of data to test hypotheses about play. We present our results at animal behavior conferences and publish in scientific journals. One thing we’ve found: Dog play that some might consider “inappropriate” or “not safe” is actually just play fighting.\nWhat is dog play fighting?\nIn the field of animal behavior, researchers often refer to social play as “dog play fighting” because it includes many of the behaviors seen during real fights and might look rougher than it really is. For example, during play, one dog might chase and tackle another, or use a neck bite to force a partner to the ground. Dogs will also hip check or slam, mount, rear up, bite, stand over, sit on, bark, snarl, growl, bare their teeth, and do chin-overs (i.e., place the underside of their chin over the neck of their partner).\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nHowever, despite the overlap in behaviors, some clear differences exist between dog play fighting and real fighting. When dogs are playing, theyinhibit the force of their bitesand sometimes voluntarily give their partner a competitive advantage (self-handicap) by, for example, rolling on their backs or letting themselves be caught during a chase — behaviors that would never happen during real fighting.\nIn addition to inhibited bites and self handicapping, dogs clearly demarcate play by employing signals, such as play bows (i.e., putting the front half of the body on the ground while keeping the rear half up in the air) and exaggerated, bouncy movements.\nAnthropologist Gregory Bateson called play signals meta-communication, meaning communication about communication. Humans employ meta-communication a lot. For example, when teasing a friend, we may smile or use a certain tone of voice to indicate that we’re just kidding. Similarly, dogs play bow to invite play and to convey playful intentions during play.\nMarc Bekoff, while at the University of Colorado, did a studyshowing that dogs are most likely to play bow just before or immediately after performing an especially assertive behavior, such as a bite accompanied by a head shake. This pattern suggests that playing dogs recognize moments when their behavior can be misinterpreted as serious aggression and compensate by reminding their partner, “I’m still playing.”\nBy using meta-communication, social beings can step through a looking glass into a world that operates by different rules. Meta-communication allows humans and dogs to pretend — that is, to perform actions that appear to be one thing but actually mean something completely different. To people unfamiliar with the notion that some nonhuman animals have this ability, play that includes archetypal aggressive behaviors, like snarling and growling, can be quite confusing. Close attention to the context, however, can help us differentiate between play aggression and real aggression.\nEven though play fighting is very different from real fighting, people often feel the need to intervene. Sometimes it is obvious at the beginning of a bout that two dogs are playing, but once the dogs start growling or their arousal intensifies, observers may no longer be sure that the dogs are still playing. After all, humans instinctively avoid a dog who is snarling orbaring his teeth, and it is natural to think that our dogs should do the same. When people interrupt really rowdy play, they assume that they are “playing it safe,” that is, doing no harm. But what if this assumption is mistaken?\nOur research shows that for many dogs, play fighting is the primary method used to negotiate new relationships and develop lasting friendships. Although play is fun, it also offers serious opportunities to communicate with another dog. In this sense, play is a kind of language. Thus, when we regularly break up what we consider “inappropriate” play, are we doing our dogs a service, or confusing them by constantly butting into their private conversations? Most importantly, how can we tell the difference?\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nHow to Tell if a Dog is Playing or Fighting\nFirst, we need to determine whether both dogs are enjoying themselves and want to continue playing. Look at their postures and facial expressions. The dog’s movements may be light, bouncy, and exaggerated, and they may have relaxed, open mouths. Watch for play signals, which can often be quite subtle — a quick dip or bounce rather than a full-blown play bow.\nIf you’re not certain that a dog really wants to be playing, try briefly holding that dog back. If they press their body into yours and avoid looking at the other dog, they’re showing relief at the interruption and you should help them avoid the other dog. If they pull against your grip in an attempt to interact with the other dog, release them. If they run toward the other dog or sends a play signal in their direction, then they’re saying that they want to keep playing.\nAn interaction like the one just described is straightforward and easy to read. However, what about instances that may not be so clear-cut? We encourage you to discard any preconceived notions about what dog play should and should not look like — at least for the time being. For example, are traditional “no-no’s” like neck biting, rearing up, body-slamming, and repeated pinning by one dog ever okay when two dogs are playing?Yes.What is “safe” dog play?Appropriate dog play fighting all depends on the individual dogs and the kind of relationship they have with one another.\nUnorthodox Dog Play: When Some Dogs Like It Rough\nConsider an example of a close canine friendship founded on unorthodox play. When Sage, a one-year-old German Shepherd, first met Sam, a four-month-old Labradoodle, he was very rough with Sam. He would pin Sam with a neck bite every few seconds. No sooner would Sam stand up than Sage would neck bite him and flip him on his back again.\nAt first, we thought that Sage might be too rough for Sam, so we would intervene by holding one or both of them back. However, each time, Sam would try his hardest to get to Sage, despite the inevitable pinning. As Sam grew larger, eventually matching Sage in weight, Sage added body slams and mounting to their play. With the exception of frequent rear-ups (in which they adopted identical roles, facing one another and boxing with their front paws), Sage usually maintained the more assertive role (neck biting, pinning, slamming and so forth). Yet, because Sam was always an enthusiastic partner, we let them continue to play together.\nTo this day, their play remains asymmetrical; Sage repeatedly brings down Sam with neck bites and continues to bite Sam’s neck once he is down. Sam wriggles on the ground and flails at Sage with his legs while Sage, growling loudly, keeps biting Sam’s neck. More than once, bystanders have thought the dogs were fighting for real, but Sage’s neck bites never harm Sam, and Sam never stops smiling, even when he’s down. Sometimes, when Sage is done playing but Sam is not, he’ll approach Sage and offer his neck, as though saying, “Here’s my neck; go ahead and pin me.” This move always succeeds; it’s an offer Sage cannot resist.\nDon’t blame the dog — instead, figure out how to help them succeed.\nWith Sage and Sam, allowing play to continue was the right decision. Their early play interactions burgeoned into a lifelong friendship. Even today, the two middle-aged boys will sometimes play together for five hours at a stretch, stopping only occasionally for brief rests. When they are finally done, they often lie together, completely relaxed, with their bodies touching. Their faces are loose and smiling, and they seem almost drunk in an endorphin-induced haze.\nThis relationship shows that play does not necessarily have to be fair or balanced in order for two dogs to want to play with one another. Years ago, scientists proposed a 50/50 rule: for two individuals to engage in play, they must take turns being in the more assertive role. Scientists thought that if one dog was too rough or forceful (e.g., pinning their partner much more often than they were being pinned), the other dog would not want to play. Until our research, this proposition was never empirically tested.\nOver a 10-year period, we studied pairwise play between adult dogs, between adult dogs andadolescents, and betweenpuppy littermates. Our findings showed that the 50/50 rule simply did not apply. Dogs do not need to take turns being assertive in order for play to take place. However, this doesn’t mean that dogs never role-reverse during play, because they often do (e.g., Sage is in the top-dog position most of the time, but sometimes Sam gets to be top dog too). It just means that role reversals usually aren’t equally balanced.\nGrowling During Dog Play\nSafi, a female German Shepherd, and Osa, a male Golden Retriever mix, were best friends for many years. When they played, they snarled a lot, lips curled and teeth exposed. The snarls looked fierce, but they often preceded silly behaviors, like flopping on the ground. Also, when something in the environment suddenly interrupted their play, the dogs’ faces would instantly shift into neutral, alert expressions while they focused on whatever had stolen their attention.\nThen, as though on cue, Safi and Osa would put their scary faces back on, almost as if they were Halloween masks, and turn toward one another. Their expressions were so exaggerated and obviously fake that they always made us laugh. Some dogs can even be trained to show a snarl on command in a context that is otherwise perfectly friendly. These observations show that dogs can exhibit nasty faces voluntarily, just as we do when we are only pretending to be mean.\nGrowling, likesnarling, is a seemingly aggressive behavior that means something different during play than it does in other contexts. We have often videotaped play between another female Shepherd, Zelda, and a male mixed-breed, Bentley. When watching these videos, we noticed that, following brief pauses in play, Zelda often stared at Bentley and growled fiercely. Whenever she did this, Bentley leaped toward her and the chase was on. Bentley moved toward rather than away from Zelda because he knew her growl was not real.\nThis phenomenon was also noted by other researchers, who recorded growls from dogs in three different contexts, including play. Play growls have different acoustical properties than growls given as threats, and when researchers played the growls back, dogs distinguished between play growls and growls given in agonistic (i.e., conflicting) contexts. If dogs can distinguish between types of growls in the absence of contextual cues (such as another playing dog), surely they know when a play partner’s growl is just pretend.\nDecoding the many sounds your pup makes.\nPlaying (Surprisingly) Peacefully\nSurprisingly, in some of the relationships we studied, dogs initiated play and preferred to play with others who were consistently assertive with them. For example, in a litter of mixed breed puppies, one female, Pink, initiated play with a female littermate, Blue, more than twice as often as she initiated play with any of her other littermates (including another sister), even though Blue adopted the assertive role during play 100 percent of the time.\nSimilarly, in our study of adult dogs, when the female German Shepherd, Safi, was playing, she was virtually always in the top-dog role. Despite this imbalance, other dogs sought Safi’s company and often invited her to play.\nSometimes people interrupt these interactions because they fear that rough play will escalate into an all-out dogfight. However, in hundreds of hours of observations of play fighting between two dogs with established relationships, we have never witnessed a single escalation to real fighting.\nOne of the authors hosted six to eight neighborhood dogs in her backyard every day for nine years, including two female German Shepherds, a male Husky, a male Husky mix, and three mixed-breeds. Their play included all of the traditional “no-no’s” mentioned previously, but no dog ever received so much as a scratch. Other scientists report similar findings. The Hungarian ethologist Vilmos Csányi writes, “In some Hungarian animal rescue organizations, more than a hundred dogs … coexist peacefully.”\nDog Play Fighting: A Natural Instinct\nSome people think that rough play is practice for real fighting (or even killing). If this were the case, the dogs mentioned in this article did a great deal of practicing for fights that never occurred. Scientists originally hypothesized that animals play fight in order to enhance their combat skills, but recent research doesn’t support this theory.\nAlthough we still do not completely understand why animals engage in social play, research suggests that animals play to help form social bonds, enhance cognitive development, exercise, and/or practice coping skills for life’s unexpected situations. All of these benefits, if real, are important to our dogs.\nLately, there has been a lot of attention paid to the question: What is “safe” dog play? Although we recommend carefully monitoring play between dogs who are significantly different in size or age, or who do not know each other well, our studies have shown that dogs are very good at figuring out which dogs they want to play with and how to play well with their friends. Presumably, dogs are better than humans at speaking and understanding dog language. Perhaps it is time to humble ourselves and listen to them.\nImportant Things to Know About Dog Play Fighting\n1.When we talk about play fighting, we mean play between two dogs rather than play between many dogs. Although multi-dog play can be fine, sometimes it involves ganging up, and then it’s time to intervene. Also: We are referring to play fighting that doesn’t involve toys, which can become the object of guarding and aggression.\n2.We recommend caution with young, inexperienced puppies. If traumatized by other dogs early on (for example, in a poorly run puppy class), a puppy may grow into a dog who isfearful, defensive, or evenaggressive with other dogs.\n3.Rough dog play fighting typically works best between two dogs who are friends. Dogs who play together a lot often develop play rituals, such as Safi and Osa’s mutual snarling, that may not be appropriate between dogs who don’t know each other well. Finally, work with your dog until they reliably come when you call them for a brief play pause.",

  "page_content": "Being overjoyed about going for a walk is almost universal among dogs. If you reach for their leash, lace up your shoes or do anything that suggests even the remote possibility that you are going for a walk, your dog is probably thrilled. But did you know that dogs love walks for different reasons? Though many dogs like everything about a walk, there are at least three categories of dogs, based on what they most love about their outings.\nThe Runner\nSome dogs are runners. What they want out of the walk is exercise, so they want to be moving, preferably as fast as possible. These are the dogs who need their daily (or twice daily or all day) activity. They oftenpull on the leashat first, but once they get into a rhythm, burn off some energy, and released some endorphins, they settle down a bit. They still want to run or trot, but they are more flexible about whatever pace you choose.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nThe Sniffer\nIt’s rare to find a dog who has no interest insniffingon their walks, but for many of them, it is their top priority from start to finish. They have their nose to the ground much of the walk, suddenly getting incredibly interested in stretches of grass that look to us, olfactory-challenged humans like every other stretch of grass. These dogs seek mental stimulation on walks, and their minds are stimulated by the smells that are here! And there! And everywhere!\nThe Greeter\nThere are some dogs whose main purpose on walks is to meet-and-greet. These are the social butterfly, table-hopper types who simply want to sayhello to other dogs, to people, or even to the occasional cat. These greeters love to connect with others and may even be disappointed if there aren’t a ton of people or other animals around. Related to the social dogs are the dogs whose purpose is marking their territory and patrolling the area. These dogs, like other social dogs, are highly interested in who is (and has been)out and about.\nMany dogs are a combination of these traits. They love to run, sniff,andsay hello. But as a their parent, you probably know your dog well enough to understand which activity is most important to them.",

  "page_content": "Every morning, my dog Daisy trotts towards me, half asleep but all a-wiggle. As soon as I bend down to show her some love, she spins around and looks back at me as if to say,You know what to do.\nLike most dogs, Daisy loves a good butt rub. She loves it as much as a belly rub — maybe more. What is it about that area that makes dogs demand “scratchies”? “The reason most dogs like their rears scratched is because that is a very hard area for them to reach themselves,” says Dr. Bonnie Beaver, professor of veterinary medicine at Texas A&M University. “Think about the hardest place you have to reach in the middle of your back...and how nice it would be if someone would scratch it for you.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n“No touch-y!”\nIt’s also an area with a lot of nerve endings, which explains the pleasure many dogs take in having their butt scratched. But Dr. Beaver recommends keeping an eye out for signs that your dog’s butt scratch request is about more than hitting the spot. Excessive scratching, a bad odor, or bald spots can signal allergies or skin issues.\nShe also cautions against offering unsolicited butt scratches, as not all dogs are into them. The thoughtful gesture will be lost on some pups, such as ones fearful of touch or others with arthritis in their backs or hind legs. If a dog growls, snaps, or simply moves away, take the hint but don’t take it personally. Says Dr. Beaver, “A few dogs are just not into being touched in many places and don’t appreciate the help.”",

  "page_content": "Raise your hand if you talk to your dog. We all do it — but do our dogs understand us? Turns out, they just might. Research shows that dogs really do understand us in ways that no other species can. A study published inProceedings of the Royal Society Bfound that young puppies respond best to a certain type of human speech called “dog-directed speech.”\nWhat is Dog-Directed Speech?\nThere is already quite a lot of research showing that the way we communicate with dogs is different from the way we communicate with other humans. Whenwe talk to dogs, we use dog-directed speech, meaning we change the structure of our sentences, shortening and simplifying them. We also tend to speak with ahigher pitch in our voices. (We might also speak this way when we’re not sure we’re understood, or when talking to young children.)\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nTheProceedings of the Royal Society Bstudy found that we use an even higher pitch when talking to puppies, and that it actually helps them pay closer attention. It also shows that talking to puppies in those short, segmented sentences makes them react and attend more to their parents than regular speech.\nTesting Dog-Directed Speech\nIn the study, researchers used  “playback” experiments in which they made recordings of humans repeating the phrase, “Hi! Hello cutie! Who’s a good boy? Come here! Good boy! Yes! Come here sweetie pie! What a good boy!” Each time, the speaker was asked to look at photos of either puppies, adult dogs, old dogs, or at no photos. Analyzing the recordings showed that volunteers spoke to each photo differently, depending on the dog’s age.\nThe researchers then played the recordings back to both puppies and adult dogs and recorded their behavior in response. They found that the puppies responded to the dog-directed speech made by the participants while they looked at dog photos, whereas older dogs did not. However, it’s worth pointing out thatother studieshave recorded dogs’ reactions to human voices in live interactions — includingwork I have done— and they suggest that dog-directed speech can be useful for communicating with canines of any age.\nGet your fix of Kinship\nWe promise not to send you garbage that turns your inbox into a litter box.

Totest thiswith your dog, you can place two identical cups covering small pieces of food in front of them, making sure they can’t see the food. Then, point to one of the cups while establishing eye contact with your dog. They will follow your gesture to the cup and explore it, expecting to find something underneath.\nThat happens because dogs understand gestures as an attempt to communicate. It’s fascinating because not even chimpanzees (humans’ closest living relatives) seem to understand that we communicate this way,nor do dogs’closest relatives, wolves— even if they’re domesticated. This has led to the idea that dogs’ skills and behaviors in this area are actuallyadaptations to the human environment. That means living in close contact with humans for over 30,000 years has led dogs to evolve communication skills that are effectively equal to those of human children.\nBut there are significant differences in how dogs understand our communication and how children do. The theory is that dogs, unlike children, view human pointing as amild commandtelling them where to go, rather than a way of transferring information. When you point for a child, on the other hand, they think you are informing them of something.\nAlthough this research is fascinating, none of it comes as a great surprise, given that dogs have been used for thousands of years to help with herding and hunting, during which they covered great distances guided by gestural instructions. The latest research, however, affirms that they can understand us humans on a deeper level, recognizing a special sensitivity in our voices. So the next time you talk to your dog, know that they really are hearing you.\nThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license. Read theoriginal article.",

  "page_content": "A great question I get from clients regularly is: “His hackles went up. What does that mean?” When the hair on a dog’s back goes up (technically calledpiloerection), it’s usually a sign that the dog is aroused, fearful, startled, stimulated, or excited in some way.\nSo, What Is a Piloerection?\nPiloerection in dogs is an involuntary reaction, just like the goose bumps we humans get, so it’s important to understand that dogs can’t control it. While aggressive dogs do exhibit piloerection sometimes, it’s notalwaysa sign of aggression. It’s important to observe a dog’s other body language, including posture and ear position, in addition to the surrounding environmental context, to determine what is causing their hackles to raise.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat Causes a Piloerection?\nData is limited on the piloerection phenomenon, but as an ethologist trained to observe animals and their behavior, I have noticed some things about it. Based on my experience with many dogs over the years, it seems that different patterns of piloerection are associated with different dog behaviors, probably because they are associated with different internal emotional states. It’s important to observe the dog’s body language and the situation around them, as well.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nWhat Does a Piloerection Signal?\nOne example I have seen in the past is some dogs exhibit a thin line (at most a few inches wide) of hair all along their back to the base of the tail. I associate this pattern of piloerection with a high level of confidence, and in my experience, these dogs are more likely to go on offense and behave in an aggressive way than other dogs.\nAnother common pattern of raised hackles in dogs is a broad patch of fur (up to eight or so inches wide) across the shoulders, which does not run more than one-quarter or one-third of the way down the back. I associate this pattern of piloerection with low confidence, and I often find that these dogs are somewhat fearful.\nThe most confusing pattern is when a patch of hair is raised at the shoulders and another is raised at the base of the tail but the hair in between the two isnotraised. This pattern of piloerection often occurs in dogs who are in an ambivalent emotional state and feeling conflicted. Many of the dogs who show this pattern are somewhat unpredictable in their behavior and are inclined to be more reactive than other dogs. Of course, there are many exceptions, but these generalizations apply to the majority of dogs that I see.",

  "page_content": "Whenever I’m walking my Pittie,Banshee, two events are nearly guaranteed: No matter the time of day, someone will inevitably see us and quickly cross the street to avoid close contact with this perceived dangerous animal. Alternatively, a passerby will go out of their way to get closer. Do they have something to prove? Maybe. Time after time, strangers will approach and compliment her beauty, her gait, her muscular build. If you can think of it, they can praise it. They’re not wrong — she’s a dime.\nBut after each initial encounter, the conversation will inescapably evolve to a reflection on the awful situations many “Pit Bulls” find themselves in due to their unfortunate reputation. Both experiences —misunderstanding and passion — share one common misconception about the breed, or lack thereof. Officially, the Pit Bull doesn’t exist.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nOkay, So WTH is a Pit Bull?\nNo, you did not just learn you’re in an alternate universe where Pit Bulls aren’t real, nor are you experiencing the Mandela Effect. Rather, this shared misconception is the result of many generations of random breeding and bad PR.The Animal Humane Society(AHS) explains that the term Pit Bull doesn’t refer to a single breed; but rather, a group of breeds. Identifying any dog by appearance can be a bit dicey, but these particular pups are known for their muscular builds, blocky heads, and often shorter snouts (yes, all traits that can also describe multiple other breeds). Unfortunately, this flexible pool of identifiers has not been kind to the dogs’ public image. AHS notes that grouping so many dogs together under one label can skew statistics and contribute to harmful stereotypes.\nWhile genetic traits play a role to a certain point (Border Collies are great at herding, Beagles are quick to pick up a trail), dogs — like people — are all different; and a dog’s personal history, living situation, training, and general treatment influences their behavior. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) explained as much in their officialstatementon Pit Bulls:\n“Physical abilities and behavior are both important facets of any breed. A well-bred dog should have both the physical attributes necessary to perform its job and the behavioral tendencies needed to learn it. However, while a dog’s genetics may predispose it to perform certain behaviors, tremendous behavioral variation exists among individuals of the same breed or breed type. The reality is that dogs of many breeds can be selectively bred or trained to develop aggressive traits. Therefore, responsible ownership of any dog requires a commitment to proper socialization, humane training, and conscientious supervision.”\nThe Breeds That Make Up a Pit Bull\nGiven the misinformation, misclassification, and general confusion associated with Pit Bull-type dogs, some of the specific breed attributes and features have become muddied over time. Clouding the field further, not even every Pit Bull-type pup is unanimously recognized as such. That being said, there are a few traits and common characteristics shared by the individual breeds that paint a decent picture.\nAmerican Pit Bull Terriersare known for their innate ability to form strong bonds with their families. They tend to have muscular builds; short coats; and can be black, white, brown, tan, or grey. Generally weighing between 30 and 65 pounds, these dogs are naturally loyal and affectionate. That said, some of them tend to have high prey drives. Banshee, for instance, will plow through any piece of furniture to get to her favorite ball. Strangely, American Pit Bull Terriers are recognized as a breed by theUnited Kennel Club(UKC) yet not by the American Kennel Club (AKC).\nSimilarly, American Staffordshire Terriers, or “Staffies,” are intensely loyal and playful, while being a bit more mellow.Petey inwas an American Staffordshire Terrier registered with the UKC as “Pal the Wonder Dog.” Despite often appearing indistinguishable from Pit Bull Terriers,Staffordshire Terriersare slighter larger, averaging around 40 to 70 pounds. They tend to be highly intelligent and confident, making them ideal candidates fortraining. Contrary to Pit Bull Terriers, Staffordshire Terriers are recognized as a breed by theAKCbut not the UKC — a pointless club rivalry not seen since Barcelona vs Chelsea.\n* Kinship recognizes both American Pit Bull Terriers and American Staffordshire Terriers for subscribers who sign up.\nOn the other end of the size spectrum, Staffordshire Bull Terriers produce smaller pitties, 24 to 38 pounds, who are gentle and patient. Though some can be prone toseparation anxiety, in general these dogs are sweet-natured, well-behaved, and family-oriented, which explains their legacy as “nanny dogs” for kids in the 1900s. Of course, they’re also loyal and affectionate. Their coats are short and smooth, while their heads are distinctly larger, making them look kind of like bobbleheads. Two pairs of Staffy brothers in Australia — The Blue BoysDarren & PhillipandRagnar & Loki— are pretty popular on Instagram and great representatives for the lovable breed.\nThe American Bulldog has a wide window on the scale front. At anywhere between 60 and 120 pounds, these pups have deeper chests and shorter muzzles. A descendant of the English Bulldog, these Pit Bull types are especially cuddly and known for loving to sit in laps despite their much larger-than-lap dog size. Similar to most pitties, American Bulldogs are pretty susceptible to allergies. And if you haven’t caught onto the trend yet, American Bulldogs are immensely loyal and affectionate.\nAs the newest breed on this list, the American Bully was recognized by theUKCin 2013, but as of yet has not been recognized by the AKC. These dogs are super stocky and compact, running around 65 to 85 pounds. Sadly, they tend to be riddled withhealth issues— from hip dysplasia to congenital heart failure to arthritis — stemming from generations of poor breeding (not unlikeEnglish Bulldogs).\nPit Bull History\nBronwen Dickey, author ofPit Bull: The Battle over an American Icon,traced the term’s first use to the 1800s. The label itself is a shortened version of the original term “pit bulldog,” which was used throughout the 19th century, Dickey toldToday. It referred to smaller, stocky, smooth-coated dogs that at the time were sadly used heavily in dog fighting. Pit Bulls are descendants of the original English Bulldog, a dog that was quite literally bred to bait bulls. As baiting animals became outlawed by way of the Cruelty to Animals Act in 1835, some turned to forcing their dogs to fight against each other. Despite this, many other Pit Bulls lived relatively low-key lives as farm dogs and family pets without incident. It’s a heartbreakingly polarizing pattern that has seemingly lingered for 200 years.\nConversely, around the turn of the 20th Century, Pit Bulls also quickly became known for their more genuine traits of playfulness, warmth, and caregiving — though it was far less publicized. Pit Bull-type dogs, particularlyStaffordshire Bull Terriers, were nicknamed “The Nanny Dog” due to their excellence with children and proclivity to protect them. For generations in America and the U.K. Pit Bulls were viewed as the safest dog to leave with a child and the most reliable for all ages. Take one scroll throughPit Bulls of Instagramand you’ll see how these loving creatures haven’t changed much over the past 100 years — merely the perception of them.\nMisrepresentation in the Media\nOf course, as with so many other issues of long-term misunderstanding through misrepresentation, the media played a major role. Despite a heartful introduction to mainstream film and television withPetey induring the 1920s, Pit Bull portrayals in the media have often fed harmful stereotypes of their behavior. Frequently appearing as inherently vicious, the way these dogs were shown on-screen throughout the following decades would leave Petey remembered more for his circled eye than his breed.\nNow, there has been a recent swift towards more positive cinematic portrayals of Pitties, highlighted byKeanu Reeves’ unnamed pupin theJohn Wicksequels — throughout which his dog is depicted as a loyal pacifist uninterested by the film’s increasingly violent world. It underscores a major theme of the movie: Pit Bulls, not inherently dangerous. Keanu Reeves, extremely dangerous, especially when armed with apencil.\nBut the media’s largest contribution to Pit Bull misinformation came courtesy of everyone’s favorite supervillain — cable news. In 2007, when NFL quarterback Michael Vick was arrested for running a dog fighting ring, it ignited a storm of coverage and subsequent investigations into not only the player himself, but also the nature of these dogs. Many seized the opportunity to perpetuate bogus myths associated with the breed, such as them possessing “locking” jaws. *\nForty-seven dogswere rescued from Vick’s operation more than a decade ago, and while they’ve all since passed, a group of them became ambassadors for the breed. Dubbed the “Vicktory Dogs” and featured in the documentaryChampions, their legacies could not be farther from their beginnings. They went on to be beloved pets, agility stars, andtherapy dogs.

To wit: In 2007, two dog attacks that occurred days apart received wildly different coverage. A senior man attacked by his Labrador Retriever and hospitalized in critical condition was covered in one local paper, while a woman bitten by her Pit Bull mix was covered by over 236 national and international news networks.\nThe media is biased against Pit Bulls when it comes to reporting dog attacks.

According toSave-a-Bull Rescue, of the roughly 1.2 million dogs euthanized annually, about 40% of them are Pit Bull mixes; plus about 75% of municipal shelters euthanize dogs that justlooklike them immediately upon intake, meaning they aren’t even given a chance. While you can find these breeds in every animal shelter in the US (so there is no excuse for buying one from a breeder) there are also many rescue organizations who have soft spots for them and are dedicated to finding them loving homes.

The sigh that means, “Stop posting pics of me on Instagram and take me for a walk!” The grumble that means, “It’s only 4:30p.m. but I’m ready for dinner, human!”\nVocalizations provide us with a window into dogs’ everyday experiences. Social species are known to be much noisier than animals who lead solitary lives. So given that dogs (and their wild progenitor, the wolf), are super social, it’s no surprise that they produce a wide range of vocalizations: theybark, whine,whimper, howl, huff, growl, yelp, and yip (among other nuanced sounds). From the earliest moments of their lives, dogs produce tonal yelps and whines, and atonal barks and grunts appear in the first few weeks of life in conjunction with the onset of social behavior.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThere’s a big difference between the bark of an adult dog and that of an adult wolf, however. Dogs seem to play every instrument in the orchestra, hitting the highs of Mariah Carey in the ’90s and the lows of a commercial narrated by Morgan Freeman. Plus, there seems to be no context in which a dogwon’tbark: They bark when alone and with other dogs. Some bark before, during, and even after a ball is thrown. A car goes by or the doorbell rings and barking ensues. In contrast, wolves bark less frequently and in fewer contexts, primarily for warning or defense.\nWhat Do Barks Mean?\nSo what do all of thoseyelps and gruntsand yips really mean? Animal behavior researchers have only recently begun to answer this question. “Vocal behavior in other species has received a lot of detailed attention,” says Monique Udell, PhD, and the Director of the Human-Animal Interaction Laboratory at the University of Oregon. “In birds, we’ve looked down to the note sequence and explored tiny variations. Vocalizations are such a prominent feature of dogs, and there is a lot to learn.” To date, dog vocalizations have not received comparable scrutiny.\nThat being said, research that has been conducted on the subject is incredibly insightful. Take growls, which, it has been shown, dogs use to accurately judge another dog’s size. How in the world do we know that? Tamás Faragó, PhD, and his colleagues at theFamily Dog Projectat Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest presented dogs with two images of the same dog: one was true to size and another was 30% larger or smaller. Dogs then listened to a pre-recorded growl, and most dogs looked at the image of the full-size dog rather than the altered image.\nWhen your dog growls, they’re expressing their emotions. A study found that you’ll likely be able to understand what they’re feeling.\nGrowlsappear to be meaningful in other ways as well. In another study, Dr. Faragó and his colleagues used some clever trickery to explore how dogs respond to growls recorded in different situations. In an apparently empty room, a dog was allowed to approach a bone. Unbeknownst to the dog, there was a speaker hidden behind the bone, and as the dog approached, the sound of a “play growl,” a “stranger-approaching” growl, or a “food-guarding” growl was transmitted through it. Dogs were likely to take the bone when hearing the “stranger-approaching” or “play” growl, but thefood-guarding“my bone” growl deterred them. Even though the food-guarding and stranger-approaching growls sound quite similar (at least, to our ears), they prompted different behavior.\nMany studies investigating vocalizations are based on pre-recorded samples, but it is important to remember that vocalizations and visual signals usually go hand-in-hand. In the stranger approaching context, dogs growled with closed mouths, whereas in food defense situations, they showed their teeth and pulled back their lips.\nWhile we tend to take notice when we hear a growl, we often dismiss barking as meaningless noise, as though it is simply an item on a dog’s daily checklist: Take a walk, have breakfast, bark. Before the turn of the century, that was the prevailing view among researchers and theorists. At most, barking was thought to result from social facilitation —  one dog barking prompts other dogs to bark — or maybe attention seeking, or even rivalry or defense.\nOnly recently have researchers begun to investigate whether barks produced in different contexts vary in their acoustic parameters (such as tone and pitch). Scientists theorized that if — like growls — barks displayed consistent differences, they might have a more specific communicative function, perhaps even be associated with a dog’s internal motivational or emotional state. For example, some barks might conveyaggressionwhile others might convey friendliness.\nSay What? A look at the types of words that dogs understand.\nIn one early study Dr. Sophia Yin, DVM, MS, recorded a variety of breeds barking in response to different situations: a stranger ringing the doorbell (“disturbance barks”), separated from an owner (“isolation barks”) and play. Dr. Yin found that the barks did indeed have different acoustic properties. Disturbance barks were harsher and lower in pitch with little amplitude modulation, while isolation and play barks were pitched higher and had greater tonal and higher frequency and a wider range of amplitude modulation. More recent studies confirm that dog barks follow particular patterns. For example, a dog barking at a stranger sounds very different from a dog barking before going on a walk.\nBut do these vocalizations carry meaning? They do for dogs. When dogs in one study listened to barks recorded in a new context or from a new dog, they gave more attention to the unfamiliar bark. This suggests that dogs can detect that some barks are different from others, though scientists are still exploring ways to determine how exactly they perceive and process that information.\nHumans, too, can decipher barks. Whether or not they’re experienced with dogs, people are quite good at classifying barks into their appropriate contexts and attributing them to perceived emotional states. After listening to randomly played recordings, people describe isolation barks as full of despair, while barks from a play session are said to be happy. (So you’re probably spot-on that your neighbor’s Dalmatian who yaps all day is lonely.) Our ability to do this starts early; by age 10, children are able to assign different-sounding barks to the correct context. Today, we can distinguish the acoustic properties of certain barks so accurately that we’re able to program computers to categorize them.\nRecognizing The Audible Patterns\nApparently, when it comes to chatting, dogs and humans have more in common than grumbling when it’s dinnertime. Through their shared mammalian histories, canine and human vocalizations follow similar acoustic patterns. High-pitched and more tonal noises convey friendliness, affiliation, and “come here,” whereas low-pitched and less tonal sounds convey aggression and “go away.” These rules and tendencies, which are found across mammalian and avian species, govern our own communication and emotional expression.\nA recent publication by Kathryn Lord, PhD, offers an additional take on why dogs bark. She and colleague Ray Coppinger, PhD, investigated the contexts in which other species use bark like sounds: “When other species emit their version of a bark, they are usually in some sort of conflicting situation. For example, an animal is at a nest or den and observes some sort of threat. Customarily, the animal would run, but because of their situation, they can’t, so they bark,” she explains. “We think [that] when dogs bark, they are making these sounds in association with an alert or an internal motivational state of conflict.”\nIn a sense, Dr. Lord and Dr. Coppinger argue that “conflicted” should be dogs’ middle name. They suggest that dogs bark in so many different situations because they often find themselves conflicted: they are in the house and want to go out, they are out and want to come in. And it may be that, through the process of domestication itself, dogs have become more prone to put themselves in these sorts of situations. In comparison with wolves, dogs have a substantially decreased flight distance; something can easily get too close before the dog feels conflicted about how to respond.\nDr. Udell suggests that barking doesn’t have to be whittled down to one simple explanation. “If you look at communication and vocalizations in a wide range of species, it usually isn’t about one thing,” he asserts. “Chickadees have ‘alert’ calls, but they also have songs, and the songs themselves can mean different things in different contexts. I think the same could hold true for dogs.”\nYoucanlive in a quiet house again.\nOther Reasons for Non-Stop Barking\nThese general insights are just part of the story. Genes and environment affect all things dog, including vocalizations. In their seminal study of dog behavior and genetics, John Paul Scott and John Fuller note that when Basenjis, a typically “barkless” dog, do actually bark, they generally produce only one or two low “woofs.” On the other hand, “the maximum number of barks recorded for a Cocker Spaniel in a 10-minute period was 907, or more than 90 a minute.” Why theGuinness Book of World Recordswas not contacted is beyond us.\nBut genes aren’t everything. As Susan Friedman, PhD, a pioneer in the application of applied behavior analysis to captive and companion animals and a psychology professor at Utah State University, explains, “While Shih Tzus as a group tend to display less barking than Miniature Poodles, that doesn’t mean barking in Miniature Poodles is impervious to change,” she says. “And I’ve certainly known individual Miniature Poodles who are quiet and individual Shih Tzus who are barky, both based on their current situations. The individual always bests any generalization.”\nDr. Yin’s study about dog barks supports this theory. Even within breeds, she found variations in who barked and when. Rudy and Siggy, 11-year-old German Shorthaired Pointers, both barked in the disturbance context, but when alone, Rudy did not bark and Siggy had lots to say.\nAnd then there are the effects of a pup’s social environment on their behavior: For example, feral dogs are much less noisy than their counterparts who play with toys, sleep in beds and go to obedience class. Dr. Friedman explains. “For dogs, barking is a functional behavior, meaning it is maintained, increased or decreased due to consequences. Once this is [understood], it opens the door to changing the duration, intensity and frequency of the behavior by changing the consequences.” In other words, dogs can learn to be quieter.\nHowever, perfect quiet is probably unrealistic. Pet parents can’t always control the stimuli that prompt barking, especially if they’re not home 24/7. Moreover, barking that has been solidified and maintained over time through intermittent reinforcement has a lot of staying power. “It seems that owners unintentionally reinforce the barks produced when a dog is around food or toys, and these become thebegging barksof that dog,” says Faragó.  Laura Monaco Torelli, CPDT-KA CTP, director of training at Animal Behavior Training Concepts in Chicago, agrees. “If a dog learns that the noise in the hallway goes away when he barks, barking becomes an effective behavior. Barking is followed by the consequence of the noise in the hallway stopping.”\nStrategies For Change\nSo what can dog moms and dads do about barking? Before you get carried away, consider whether or not action is even required. Dr. Friedman advises taking a step back. “When we ask, ‘Is barking a behavior problem?’ the [next] question is, ‘For whom?’ Barking certainly is a problem when people say it is, and for dogs, it is a problem when they are spending so much time doing it that it eclipses other healthful activities.”\nPet parents should focus not oneliminating barkingaltogether, but on reducing it to levels they find appropriate and livable. When she meets with clients to discuss their dogs’ barking issues, Monaco Torelli asks questions such as, “How many barks is okay? What’s excessive to you?” This, she says, gives the trainer a good starting point from which to develop a plan to teach the client how to reshape a dog’s barking behavior. Trainers and pet parents discuss acceptable barking, and then implement techniques to achieve desired levels in each context.\nDr. Friedman shares the way she manages her own dog’s barking: “We live in the country, and when we let the dogs out, they bark at the deer for a number of seconds. Then we say, ‘That’s enough, thank you,’ and they are quiet and we praise them.” She adds, “It’s a [mistake] to think that barking is the problem. The real problem is that dogs don’t stop barking when we ask.”\nSo-called “quick fixes” can make barking worse, particularly if the underlying reason for the behavior isn’t addressed. “Putting an anti-bark collar on a fearful dog is unlikely to decrease barking if the consequence [shock or spray] increases the dog’s fear. If the fear increases, barking could as well,” explains Maryland-based Mary Huntsberry, MA, ACAAB. It helps to start early and be observant. Teaching dogs theboundariesof acceptable vocalizations from an early age will pay off for everyone; when pups are young, barking might be cute, but as they age, the cute factor tends to wear off. If the behavior is already in place, there are ways to alter it, Huntsberry observes. “It helps to do a functional analysis. During an extensive interview, I identify what happens immediately before (antecedent) and after (consequence) the unwanted behavior so I can identify the trigger and what maintains it.”\nMonaco Torelli focuses her attention on the dog-human relationship. “When owners are frustrated by their dog’s behavior, we show them some immediate training goals and success points so they see that their dog can do what they want them to be doing, instead of what they don’t want them to do,” she says. This helps them rebuild their bond with their dog. The takeaway message is that barking is a nuanced and flexible behavior, and relationships can grow by paying attention to what your dog’s vocalizations mean. Maybe all that whining for a walk means your pup knows youbothneed to step away from social media for a second and get outside.",

  "page_content": "How much do you really know about dogs? From fastest dog to poop alignment, the fact is dogs have some incredible abilities. But did you know that they can evensmell the passage of time? Yep, it’s true. Here are 15 incredible dog facts that you probably don’t know.\n1. They have an incredibly fast sniff rate.\nA dog breathes in and out around 15 times per minute when sitting calmly, compared to a typical human who breathes out 12 to 20 breaths per minute. A dog's breathing frequency goes up to 31 times per minute while walking. But when a dog is actively sniffing, the inhalation/exhalation rate goes up to 140 to 200 times per minute.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n2. Dogs communicate with more than vocals.\nDogs do communicate with each other when they vocalize, bark or growl. But a more common means of communication between dogs is body language — an upright or tucked tail, forward ears, or tense bodycan speak volumes.\nThis body language is not as simple as you probably think.\n3. Petting sessions relax shelter dogs.\nResearchers have confirmed that a quiet,15-minute petting sessioncan relax a shelter dog and result in positive behavioral and physiological changes.\n4. Humping is more common among males.\nStudies from dog parks recorded thathumping, or more politely, mounting was 16 times more frequent in male-male pairs as compared to female pairs.\nNo less than 7 animal behaviorists weigh in on what’s behindall of this bumping and grinding.\n5. How a dog greets varies by sex.\nFemale dogs are more likely to greet other dogs by smelling the snout/muzzle first, while males go for the anogenital region. (You might be able to sex the dogs who greet your dog based on this behavior alone.)\n6. Paw preference may correlate to personality.\nAnother cool fact about dogs relates to their paw preference. Dogs who show paw preference and those who are reported to be right-pawed are associated with lower arousal and calmer responses to novel stimuli and strangers.\nYour dog’s wag and paw preference say a lot about their personality.\n7. Female dogs are better smellers.\nIs it true female dogs are better at smelling than males? The experts who wroteK9 Scent Trainingobserved that to be the case, and Alexander Horowitz added thatwomen are often keener “smellers” than men.\n8. Dogs are individuals.\nNot all Retrievers like to play fetch or Pointers point at things. In fact, the seminal research,Genetics and the Social Behavior of the Dog, states that there is oftengreater variability between dogswithin the same breed than between breeds in temperament and talent .\nA new study found that a dog’s breed accounts for less than 10 percent of their behavior.\n9. Dogs are way better smellers than us.\nDogs have 125 to 300 million olfactory cells (compared to our 5 million), and 33% of their brain is dedicated to interpreting odors. Frank Rosell, scientist and author ofSecrets of the Snout, estimates that a dog’s nose is between 100,000 and 100 million times more sensitive than a human’s.\n10. Gazing is good for both of us.\nA dog gazing into our eyes, and us looking into theirs, showed a markedincrease in oxytocin(the “love” hormone) levels in both humans and dogs. This is similar to mother-infant relationships.\nThe connection between people and dogs is the stuff of legend.\n11. Dogs come in vastly different sizes.\nThe tallest dog on record is aGreat Dane who stood 44 inchestall, and the shortest dog was a Chihuahua, measuring just 3.8 inches in height.\n12. Dogs can smell the passage of time.\nAccording to researcher and author Alexandra Horowitz, “Dogs smell time.” Because of their extremely sensitive noses, dogs can smell the way odors change over time. They smell time as a complex layer of both new (stronger) and old (weaker) smells.\nThere’s no time like the present, according to your pet.\n13. Dogs aren’t as fast as cats (sort of).\nThe cheetah, the world’s fastest land animal and a large cat of the subfamily Felinae, can race up to 75 mph for short bursts. The Greyhound is thefastest canid, with a peak speed of about45 mph.\n14. Dogs can sense the earth’s magnetic field.\nWhen your dog is carefully choosing the perfect place to do his business, it is because they prefer to go poop in alignment with the Earth’s magnetic field.\nYour dog’s sense of direction changes with the Earth’s magnetic fields, influencing their orientation when pooping and acting as an internal compass.\n15. The Origin of The Dog Days of Summer\nConsidered to be the hot, lethargic days of late July and early August. Ancient Greek and Roman astrology observedthis periodto coincide with the appearance of the star system Sirius — the Dog Star.",

Dogs can obtain an amazing amount of information about other dogs just from smelling each other or even each other’s urine (e.g., Male or female? Intact or spayed/neutered? In heat? Young or old? Familiar or a stranger?). Given what we know they are able to perceive with their nose — they can even“smell time”—, it’s a bit hard to imagine that they can’t detect at least some of the many hormonal changes that accompany pregnancy in a human living in their house.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nAsk a Vet\nPet health question that’snotan emergency? Our vet team will answer over email within 48 hours. So, go ahead, ask us about weird poop, bad breath, and everything in between.\nOnce a pregnancy is far along, women change their movements too, partly because of the natural loosening of the joints, and partly because carrying another person in your abdomen is cumbersome, to say the least. Dogs are very sensitive to movement and posture of the most subtle form in other individuals. That pregnant kangaroo stance and that waddling gait are far from subtle, and cannot be hidden, especially from pups.\nPregnancy is also often accompanied by behavioral changes, and these can extend beyond the woman expecting to other members of the household. With more doctor appointments for example, the pup’s schedule may change with less time for walks and runs. Furniture may be rearranged in anticipation of the baby’s arrival (never on a pup’s list of relaxing things happening around the house!). Most dogs are going to pick up on at least some of the changes associated with pregnancy, and these can certainly have an influence on their behavior. And that’s before the baby even arrives!

Other behaviors, though, can be embarrassing and borderline rude — like when your dog tries to smell a stranger’s crotch while you’re out on a walk. Awkward!\nYour instinct might be to suppress this kind of behavior, but it’s important to understand that crotch sniffing is perfectly appropriate indog speak. Dogs are still dogs, even though you consider them part of your family. Understandingwhythey perform certain behaviors (like crotch smelling) will make it easier to know what’s normal and what’s not. Keep reading to learn what to do about a crotch-sniffing dog.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nBorn to Sniff\nAs a canine behaviorist and trainer, one of the questions I am asked frequently is “How can I stop my dog from sniffing everyone’s crotch?” As with all behavior modification, the key is to understand the root cause of the issue.\nA dog’s most dominant sense is their sense of smell, and sniffing is one of their most natural behaviors. With a scent sensitivity many thousands of times greater than our own, dogs have a specialized structure within their nasal cavity called the olfactory recess. This maze of airways allows dogs to sniff odors that are undetectable to us. Dogs have 125 to 300 million olfactory cells (compared to our mere 5 million), and 33% of their brain is dedicated to interpreting odors.\nResearch by scientists at Pennsylvania State University showed that dogs have the incredible ability to take a different odor into each nostril and analyze it. They are a species of superior sniffers. Dogs make sense of the world through scents, much in the same way that people rely heavily on vision.\nWhy Do Dogs Smell Your Crotch?\nFirst, it helps to understandthe reason that dogs sniff each other’s bums: Dogs have pouches located on either side of the sphincter calledanal glandsor anal sacs. They are lined with oils and sweat glands, and they release an odor that is unique to each dog. When dogs take in the scent produced by these glands, they are able to gather a lot of information about the other dog including sex, age, health, mood, and wellbeing.\nIf we transfer that to humans, our sweat glands and the scent they produce is often most concentrated around our genital areas and armpits. As most dogs cannot easily reach up to our armpits, the crotch is the go-to area to get the information they need on a new person.\nTo a dog, crotch sniffing is not bad manners. Dogs have no idea that placing their noses into the crouch of a human is not socially acceptable. We need to teach them that when it comes to people, we would prefer an alternative method to get to know each other.\nHow to Put a Stop to Crotch Sniffing\nIt can be relatively easy to squash this behavior with consistency and heavily rewarding your dog when they choose not to smell someone’s crotch. While you can’t train out the innate behavior, itcanbe redirected. The key to training away unwanted crotch sniffing is to offer an alternative region for your dog to gather the information they want and gently block the current go-to area. Each time your dog attempts to crotch sniff, follows these simple steps:\nGive a clear instruction to stop and if necessary, include a previously learned command such as “wait.” For example: “No Rover, wait” or “No, Rover, look at me.”\nGive a clear instruction to stop and if necessary, include a previously learned command such as “wait.” For example: “No Rover, wait” or “No, Rover, look at me.”\nOffer a hand slowly and palm up for inspection, while turning the crotch away or blocking it with something. This area of the hand also carries a lot of sweat glands and can be sufficient to gather the information they need to satisfy them.\nOffer a hand slowly and palm up for inspection, while turning the crotch away or blocking it with something.

Timing, as always, is key. Give them enough time to sniff and then immediately offer the treat.\nIf you have a more insistent dog, start with placing your dog on a leash. If they are trying to get to the crotch and will not accept the hand being offered, stand still, keeping them back. Do not yank them back. The only pressure being applied on the leash should come from your dog. Allow them to calm down a little. Maybe walk them around and retry, showing them a hand when returning to the visitor.\nIf they get to a crotch before you can prevent them, the owner of the crotch should gently push them away while turning. Once you have control of your dog, repeat by offering the hand and rewarding your dog’s decision to sniff that instead. The idea is to show your dog how you want them to behave. When your dog sniffs hands instead of crotches, always give them a signal that this is the right thing to do (say “good dog” or ”yes”). Most dogs understand within a few months that hand sniffing is more socially acceptable than crotch sniffing and that it will result in special praise from you or a tasty treat. After some time consistently training this, hand sniffing becomes conditioned over crotch-sniffing.\nIt’s best to start this training at home, using family and visitors to practice on. Setting a dog up for success in a controlled environment where you are unlikely to feel pressure or embarrassment goes a long way to change their behavior long-term.",

  "page_content": "Who among us has not been stepped on by a dog who seemed completely unaware that their paws were on our feet? Who has a giant pup who lays on you like they’re a lap dog? (Raises hand.) It makes us wonder what kind of general body-awareness dogs actually have.\nEvidence Dogs Do Know Their Size\nAstudy published in 2019looked into this very question and found evidence that dogs do indeed have an awareness of their own body. Essentially, the scientists asked if dogs understand their body as an object of a particular size. If so, they should react differently to whether they fit through wall openings of different sizes.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nAs the researchers predicted, dogs’ responses to openings that were too small for them to pass through were different than their responses to openings that were large enough. Much of the study involved comparing the time it took dogs to approach the different-sized openings.\nHere are the details: The dogs were tested on three sizes: smaller than their body; intermediate, or approximately the same as their body; and larger than their body. Dogs were slower to move toward an opening that was too small than they were toward one that was larger. After being tested with the smaller and larger openings, dogs were faced with an intermediate-sized space: one they could fit through, but without much room to spare. Not surprisingly, the time it took them to move toward this space was between the times for openings that were too small or much larger.\nI agree with the researchers’ prediction — that being aware of their own size would cause hesitation at the small openings and, to a lesser extent, at medium openings — but this isn’t the only explanation for the dogs’ behavior in this experiment. Even without familiarity with this particular set-up, dogs’ experiences may have taught them what they can and can’t fit through. The results of the experiment may simply reflect some generalization by dogs from a lifetime of experience.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nEvidence Dogs Don’t Know Their Size\nEven though the results of the research are consistent with such an awareness, they do not disprove other possible explanations. Dogs have a lot of experience moving around in the world and going through or between things. Perhaps what this experiment shows is that they are capable of determining what they won’t fit through, which might simply mean they can see that objects and gaps are different sizes.\nThere is certainly evidence that dogs can be taught to have better body awareness based on experiences. In fact, there are many classes that offer to do just that, especially for dogs who compete in agility. By practicing a variety of skills — walking backward, weaving through a person’s legs, crawling forward and backward, putting front or back paws on a platform and walking backward up a stair or two — dogs improve their ability to coordinate their own movements in a variety of situations.\nMany trainers have dogs practice walking over a ladder lying flat on the ground. Dogs who have practiced doing this are less likely to step on the rungs (especially with their back paws) than dogs who are new to the task. As trainers, we commonly say that dogs need to learn where their back paws are, and many believe that dogs who have done so are less likely to stand on the delicate feet of their humans.",

Your pup may not be able to talk but they havea lotto say — and it gets communicated in more ways than you might think (there’s so much more to it than barks and tail wags). Chin, who has been drawing dogs for over 20 years, has illustrated dozens of canine-body-language charts for a number of organizations including shelters, law-enforcement training programs, the World Health Organization, theDog Decoder mobile appand even the Swiss Fire Brigade. She also was co-creator of the Warner Brothers’ hit animated seriesMucha Lucha.Chin has captured her drawings in her recent book,Doggie Language, which decodes canine body language so you can understand the subtle clues your dog is giving you. Here, she tells us what inspires her, plus why it’s so important for pet parents to speak “dog” in the first place.\nSpeaking as an artist who lives with a dog and someone who has worked for professional dog behavior consultants, I feel it’s important so that people and dogs can have better relationships. With dog body-language knowledge, people can avoid getting bitten and are less likely to unintentionally hurt dogs due to misinterpretations of what they’re seeing.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nOver the years, I’ve illustrated several “dog bite prevention” infographics. A key message is that dogs don’t bite out of the blue. But when their (silent) requests for space are ignored or misinterpreted, they are more likely to escalate to aggressive behaviors like growling or biting. So, learning dog body language is also important for the safety of humans. Not all tail wags are friendly and neither is all eye-contact.\nIf we know how to listen to dogs, we can help them when they’re stressed. We can change what we’re doing or arrange things so they feel safe. We can know if they are enjoying an experience, or hating it, or are confused by it. Basically, I think that learning dog body language is essential to dogs’ health and welfare.\nI’ve been aprofessional artistsince the 90s and have a background in hand-drawn animation, so I have a good amount of experience drawing characters in different poses with different expressions to show changes in movement. I have also drawn many dog body language charts for dog trainers and welfare organizations, which has exposed me to lots of visual reference material.\nPlus, I have my own dog — Boogie, a Boston Terrier — as a model. I think the biggest challenge is learning to see nuances and details so I can represent these accurately within a style that is simple (and not photorealistic). I seek out photos and get feedback from professionals to make sure I’m getting it right.\nThe first step is seeing. There was a time when I was oblivious to many of the small behaviors listed in this book. I saw the big behaviors, but not the tiny ones. When I saw my first “lip lick” for instance, and learned that this is a sign of discomfort or concern, I could no longer not see lip licks. The second step is looking at the whole body in context. What changed in the environment? How did the dog’s posture, eyes, ears, tail and mouth change in reaction to that change?\nIt also takes knowing dogs as individuals — age, breed, health, unique experiences. For example, Boogie, who’s now 16, is deaf, blind, may have a brain tumor, and no longer moves like he used to. He often looks stiff and moves slower, and his rounded back-end makes him look like he’s scared or about to do a number two, but I know this is actually due to his age and neurological issues.\nHere are the people who have had the biggest impact on my education and work, but there have been so many! I feel like I’m still always learning.\nTurid Rugaas. I was first introduced to Turid Rugaas’s calming signals by our trainer, Sarah Owings. This was back around 2009.

My reference material was basically what I had on my bookshelf — photos in Brenda Aloff’sCanine Body Languageand Barbara Handelman’sCanine Behavior— and the internet. I also watched many videos on YouTube, and friends sent me photos of their dogs doing different things in different situations.\nOne challenge for me was drawing dogs with floppy ears and different kinds of tails. As Boogie doesn’t have floppy ears or much of a tail, I requested photos from dog trainers in a private Facebook group, and people were very generous in sharing photos of their own dogs with floppy ears and different body types. That was very helpful. I hope this book opens up awareness about dog body language and helps people see what they may not have noticed before. I also hope it makes talking and learning about this subject interesting and fun!",

  "page_content": "These days, most dogs enjoy a pretty chill life — lying on the couch and then a walk around the neighborhood — but that understimulation can result in the boredom that is the enemy of the happy, well-behaved dog.\nAnd while some pups may get enough physical activity, many don't have many opportunities to exercise their minds. That's where enrichment for dogs come in. Making dogs work to get treats (or even all of their food) by solving thepuzzlesoffered by enrichment toys is a natural fusion.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhat is Enrichment for Dogs?\nEnrichment provides massive benefits to animals under human care, whether those animals are in zoos, aquaria, shelters or sleeping on our couch. What is far less well known is exactly what “enrichment” means beyond feeding animals in a way that presents challenges to acquiring food or giving them puzzle toys or regular toys to amuse them.\nEnrichment for dogs has often been defined narrowly: enrichment is a variety ofplay,toysandexerciseto make dogs’ lives richer and more interesting. But enrichment is also so much more than that.\nProviding enrichment to dogs (or to anyanimal under your care) requires recognizing the importance of natural behaviors to animals’ well-being and placing value on creating opportunities for those natural behaviors to be performed.\nIn the bookCanine Enrichment for the Real World, authors Allie Bender and Emily Strong note that enrichment can be defined as “meeting all of an animal’s needs as closely as possible to how they would be met in the wild, in order to empower them to engage in species-typical behaviors in healthy and appropriate ways.”\nThe emphasis on eliciting natural behaviors adds to the concept — and to your dogs’ quality of life — substantially. Dogs have an extensive range of natural behaviors, and many of the items on the list are familiar to us:physical exerciseof sufficient quantity and intensity; mental stimulation, such as problem-solving and exploring;digging; barking;chewing; social interactions with both people and other dogs; and sufficientsleep.\nEnrichment Ideas for Dogs\nEach dog has their own interests. it’s up to the individual person and their dog to determine whether or not any of these activities are especially satisfying for their dog.\nKongs are a wonderful way to provide problem solving opportunities, mental exercise, and the ability for dogs to use their mouths in the physical way that so many dogs need.\nTwo words: Endless entertainment.\nThe nose work training process encourages dogs to refine their innate hunting and scenting skills providing constructive physical exercise and intense mental enrichment.\nThe latest training activity develops your dog’s natural scenting abilities through fun and games.\nFetch is fun and interactive, it enhances the relationship between you and your pup and provides plenty of enrichment through skill building and physical exercise.\nFor some dogs, it’s not as simple as just throwing a ball.\nTreat dispensing toys provide plent of mental enrichment. Playing and chewing releases feel-good chemicals in the brain, which keeps dogs happy, busy, and using up energy.\nLet the games begin.\nTreat-puzzle games are a fun and easy way to stimulate the dog’s senses — think of them like a enrichment “tool” for the dog to use its natural instincts.\nThese puzzle toys are made to help you bond with your pup.\nTugis a great enrichment game for most dogs. Dogs learn lessons such as impulse control, mouth control and cooperation as well as skills like “take it” and “drop it.”\nBasics of the tug game and how to troubleshoot common problems.\nAgilityworks for pretty much every dog, no matter the breed, size or age. It’s an enriching sport that provides both physical and mental exercise and skill building.\n5 reasons to get your dog in the agility game, from burning energy to building confidence.\nHerding and treibball provide dogs with enrichment through problem-solving the process of tending to a flock.\nIf your dog needs a job, trainers recommend Treibball.\nTraining your dog with tricks can boost their confidence, enhance their abilities, and give them a good amount of mental and physical stimulation.\nTrick training increases their focus and gives your relationship a boost.\nDogs are equipped with an amazing sniffer. Allowing your dog toexplore different scentscan enhance their well-being and provide them with the opportunity to engage in their natural instincts.\nA “sniffari” gives your dog a chance to be the boss.\nBy switching between the excitement of playing and the discipline of responding to a cue, training games can provide dogs with an enriching experience.\nCue theSchoolhouse Rock!because learning can be fun.\nOther enrichment ideas includesnuffle mats, lure coursing, Frisbee andrunning games.\nJust because you don’t have an working dog doesn’t mean your dog doesn’t love to be busy. No matter their age, breed or size, all dogs have a natural desire to engage in enriching mental and physical activities. Leave them to their own devices and they’ll likely find activities that have the potential to create havoc in your home!\nTips on Dog Enrichment Ideas\nThe following general tips are essential for working toward providing the best enrichment possible for your dog.\nDogs have different needs in terms of what they enjoy and how much time they want to spend on such activities, including how much time they spend in social contact with others.\nWhether those choices are about which way to walk, what to sniff, or whether or not to approach a person — choice provides enrichment. Having some control over their environment and what happens to them prevents dogs from feeling powerless, which in turn can lead to all kinds of negative emotions.\nPhysical exercise affects the whole body. While exercise affects the brain, mood, digestion, memory, appetite, sleep, learning, stress, impulse behavior, depression and anxiety, not just any physical exercise will do.Some dogs require hard exercisefor considerable amounts of time each day while others thrive with shorter, gentler bouts of physical activity. (Interestingly, the many benefits of exercise are not achieved through forced treadmill exercise.)\nProviding a spot for refuge that may be used by a dog who needs to relax in a busy household can make a huge difference to many dogs.\nMental stimulation isn’t just enrichment games. Dog sports, play, training, foraging and walks all offer dogs an opportunity to use their brains in beneficial ways.\nDogs typically have a need to engage in activities that they enjoy whether that’s digging, barking, going onsniffari, sleeping a lot, chewing, foraging or playing. Allowing them opportunities to engage in what comes naturally is a major goal of enrichment.\nOf course, some behaviors that dogs enjoy — such as digging, barking and chewing — are problematic for pet parents (and neighbors!) and can even indicate a dog in distress if they are being done to excess. The goal of enrichment is not unlimited chances to engage in such behaviors, but to create enjoyable and appropriate opportunities to do so.",

  "page_content": "Not surprisingly, astudyfound that theEnglish Bulldogno longer retains enough genetic diversity to correct life-threatening physical and genomic abnormalities. This means breeders cannot use the established population of purebred Bulldogs to reverse the trend of extreme and painful exaggerations such as crippling dwarfism and respiratory deformities—traits that uninformed pet parents, unfortunately, find appealing. How did this happen? Can anything be done to save the English Bulldog?\nIt all goes back to English Bulldogs in the 1800s.\nIn the early 1800s, Bulldogs were trained forbull-baiting, a particularly cruel and vicious sport. In 1835 the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals convinced Parliament to enact the first animal cruelty law for the protection of domestic animals, including outlawing bull baiting.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nAs such, the Bulldog had outlived its usefulness. Like the pre-19th century Wolfhound that disappeared with the eradication of wolves in the British Isles and the Tumbler whose demise was the invention of hunting firearms, the Bulldog was destined for extinction.\nBut, beginning around 1840, the Victorian dog fancy’s unabashed sentimentality was a catalyst for saving even the most formidable working breeds from their inevitable demise. Like many others, such as the Dachshund and Mastiff, Bulldogs went from working hard to hardly working. Utility dogs were “refined” and transformed to fill jobs they weren’t originally bred for—as show dogs and companions. Altered physical and behavioral characteristics and decreased aggression levels were more compatible with their augmented duties as house pets.\nThe American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1886. So, beginning in the late 1890s, Bulldog breeders selected small groups of genes from a diverse genome to manipulate the dog’s appearance. They were, in effect, increasing the odds that genetic anomalies would more likely be expressed in an effort to bring out exaggerated traits, like the Bulldog’s baby-like face, corkscrew tail, and affable personality.As “desirable” aesthetic traits were selected for, other genetic variants, including beneficial genes that contribute to overall health, were eliminated from their gene pool, never to be reclaimed.\nGet your fix of Kinship\nWe promise not to send you garbage that turns your inbox into a litter box.

Driven by economics, fashion, and uninformed decisions, breeders and buyers either ignore or are unaware of the significant genetic problems that have spread throughout the Bulldog population.\nThe health problems of the English Bulldog have been well documented. The breed ranks second in congenital disease deaths among puppies. Their brachycephalic skull causes upper respiratory problems, a leading cause of death among Bulldogs. But that’s not all—there’s also chondrodysplasia (a skeletal disorder causing hip and elbow dysplasia) and a myriad of other health problems with bulldogs’ teeth, skin, heart,eyes, and immune system.The demise of the breed may not be a good thing for Bulldog enthusiasts, but it will put an end to the malformed and painfully crippled modern Bulldog that is recognized today. The good news is that some breeders intend to bring back the “Olde-Fashioned-Bulldogge” by cross-breeding with similar breeds to re-diversify the genome. Will Bulldog enthusiasts jump on board to save the breed and ensure they can live a healthy and happy life? Only time will tell.",

    "title": "Are Dog Parks Good for Socialization?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/are-dog-parks-good-socialization"
  },
  "page_content": "My husband and I are having a disagreement. He wants to take our two-year-old dog to the dog park for socialization because we don’t want her to become rusty at getting along with other dogs. But I have read that you can only socialize puppies—that it doesn’t work for adult dogs. Can dogs of all ages be socialized? Should we take our dog to the dog park?\nIn the world of canine behavior, the word “socialize” has a specific technical meaning (which I’ll address shortly), but it is also commonly used to describe another activity: to engage in social interactions. The latter is what your husband seeks for your dog at the dog park. As long as she enjoys other dogs and can play appropriately with them, she is a good candidate for visits there. There are a few caveats.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nDog Park Socials vs. Socializing a Puppy\nMake sure that the dog park is one where people are responsible for the dogs they bring and about monitoring behavior, and that there is enough room for dogs to romp and play without feeling cornered by the crowd. My favoritedog parkshave many acres, trails for walking and open areas for playing. Smaller parks can work as long as they are not too small for the dogs to spread out a bit and run around. But, socializing a puppy and providing an adult dog with a social life are two different things.\nPositive Puppy Socialization Experiences\nTo socialize means to expose a puppy to a variety of new experiences during a critical period of their lives. The critical period in puppies is from about three to 14 weeks of age; during that time, dogs are particularly receptive to learning that new things are not scary. It is much harder for them to learn to feel comfortable about new things later on in life.\nA good analogy is learning a language. When we learn a language as young children, we do it well and we do it thoroughly. Once we are beyond childhood, we can learn languages, but rarely can we learn them as well and with as little effort. The goal ofsocializing puppiesis to help them reach a point where they have the social skills necessary to engage with other dogs, people and perhapscats.\nWith patience and positive reinforcement, you can do a lot to make up for lost time with socialization.\nWe also want them to be able to handle cars, bikes,skateboarders, shopping carts, musical instruments, theTV, the sound of phones and alarms, and so much more—all things that they will encounter throughout their lives. We want them to be as fluent in daily life as we are in our first language.\nThe critical period is also called the sensitive period, and dogs are very sensitive to the experiences they have at this age. Good experiences make it likely that they will easily accept those things throughout life, but bad experiences can be traumatic and especially hard to get over. Positive experiences are the goal when socializing a puppy, so the focus should be on quality (exposing the puppy to new things in pleasant ways) rather than focusing on quantity (exposing the puppy to as many things as possible, no matter how overwhelming such experiences may be).\nDog Parks Aren’t for Puppies\nIt’s easy to overwhelm puppies, which is one of the reasons I don’t like puppies to go to the dog park. It’s far too likely that another dog will overdo it (perhaps aggressively, but more commonly due to an overabundance of exuberance) and scare or overwhelm the puppy, setting up a young dog for a life of concern about other dogs. Dog parks are better for dogs once they are past the puppy stage, but puppies can and should have play dates with very small groups of sociable dogs who play appropriately.\nOnly puppies can be socialized in the technical sense, but adult dogs can benefit from social interaction. Not all dogs need to be around other dogs or benefit from being social in the general sense, but many do. It’s great for dogs who like other dogs and can play appropriately to spend time at the dog park, as long as it is one where people behave responsibly and there’s enough space.",

    "title": "How to Train and Communicate with a Deaf Dog",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/challenges-and-rewards-living-deaf-dog"
  },
  "page_content": "There’s a brief moment in the iconic 1967 movie,The Graduate, that helps me imagine what life is like for my 15-year-old Corgi, Edgar, who has lost most of his hearing. Early in the film, Benjamin Braddock, the eponymous graduate, enters a pool party given by his parents in his honor, wearing full scuba gear. While he can see guests’ mouths moving and read their facial expressions, all he can hear inside the diving mask is the sound of his own breathing.\nEvery now and then, I look Edgar straight in the eye and say, “Plastics.” That’s the advice given to Benjamin by the soon-to-be-cuckolded Mr. Robinson about a possible career path. No one ever laughs at my jokes, so Edgar’s blank look is not new, but it makes me feel as though I am still communicating with him even though he cannot hear. It might seem petty to worry about his deafness when Edgar is in otherwise perfect health. But I realized that his deafness was a barrier to our bond, and that I felt as estranged from him as he undoubtedly did from me. He had never come when he was called, so that was nothing new. But suddenly he looked away when I said the various trigger words — “Let’s go for a walk,” “Do you want a treat?” “Do you want to ride in the car?” — that used to cause him to cock his head from side to side in a manner that made it clear we were communicating.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nSigns of Hearing Problems with Your Dog\nIf your dog experiences the following, it could be a sign of deafness or another ear condition that should be evaluated by your veterinarian:\nInattentiveness or change in obedience\nInattentiveness or change in obedience\nInability or confusion when following familiar vocal commands\nInability or confusion when following familiar vocal commands\nProlonged barking\nProlonged barking\nDifficulty waking up\nDifficulty waking up\nRepetitive head shaking or tilting toward side of affected ear\nRepetitive head shaking or tilting toward side of affected ear\nPainful ears or smelly discharge from ears\nPainful ears or smelly discharge from ears\nChange in personality\nChange in personality\nCauses of Dog Hearing Loss\nDogs’ hearing mechanism is basically the same as that of humans, and they experience hearing loss for many of the same reasons: they can be congenitally deaf (deaf since birth), or they can acquire deafness due to having dirt, wax, ear mites, or other foreign bodies in the ear; an infection or inflammation of the ear canal; trauma to the head; noise trauma; exposure to certain antibiotics or other drugs; or old age. I do not know when or why Edgar lost his hearing — part of it was undoubtedly just part of the normal aging process.\nBut he also had an ongoing skin infection that extended into his ears, which I treated with antibiotics, either of which can cause hearing loss. His hearing seemed to have deteriorated overnight, but most likely, it was a gradual process that I didn’t notice until he exhibited some of the more obvious symptoms: pacing around looking for his people, suffering obvious distress at being left alone, exhibiting a pronounced startle response at being touched while he was asleep.\nDogs are especially at risk for ear infections. Here’s what to look out for.\nTraining a Deaf Dog\n“In hearing, as in most other things, dogs are very adaptive and good at compensating,” says Dr. Colette Williams, DVM and electro-diagnostician at the University of California at Davis, Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital. Among many other tests that she conducts, she assesses animals for hearing loss using brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) technology. Many seeking her expertise are breeders, who use BAER to identify congenital deafness in their puppies.\nDr. Williams has tested thousands of dogs and has owned two deaf dogs of her own. One of her dogs, a deaf-from-birth Dalmatian, learned hand signals that Dr. Williams created. “The key was consistency, and rewarding him with treats,” she says. “I had another dog whocouldhear at the time, and he was harder to train than the deaf dog.” Hearing dogs often aid a deaf dog, Dr. Williams points out. They give social cues and can help with training. Like Edgar has had to do, Williams’ deaf dog accepted his condition and got on with life. “Dogs don’t have the self-pity that a lot of people have.”\nSeattle-area dog trainer Diane Rich, who has worked with numerous deaf dogs over the past 25 years, points out the importance of developing other modes of communication regardless of whether your dog is deaf or has tip-top hearing. She teaches people to use a combination of body language, hand signals, and auditory cues. That way, if the dog loses hearing in old age, they won’t feel quite as isolated. “People want to keep up communication with an older dog,” she says. “It takes a lot of patience. You have to learn how to communicate differently, not just verbally.”\nRich also recommends teaching all puppies a “watch” command in addition to the usual commands. Hold some alluring food near the dog’s nose and slowly bring it to your eye level, maintaining eye contact with the dog. Say “Watch” or “Look.” Work on “fading the lure,” and eventually, you’ll be able to just point to your eye and have the dog’s full attention. “Dogs use an array of body language already,” says Rich. “People need to be able to use their own body language to communicate with their dog.”\nWhile some people teach their deaf dogs American Sign Language, any hand signal will do, as long as you’re consistent. “There’s no ceiling to how many words or signs a dog can learn,” says Rich. “They can learn as long as they have a pulse and you have motivation and patience. If you make training fun, they’re going to love learning, and it’s going to cement your bond.” She points out that it’s not true that you can’t teach an old dog new tricks: sometimes it’s easier to train older dogs because they have longer attention spans.\nLiving with a Deaf Dog\nInstead of feeling bad for your pup, take a matter-of-fact approach to your deaf dog’s disability. “Dogs aren’t saddled with ego,” she says. “If we pity them, we can create a situation where the dog may either shut down or act out because they think they did something wrong to make us feel bad. If you act like the disability isn’t a big deal, dogs will respond like it’s not a big deal.”\nEvery day, Edgar and I practice the hand signals we learned in puppy class 15 years ago, which he still remembers: come, sit, stay, down, good boy. I smile a lot and pat him while giving the “thumbs up” sign when he does something well. I continue to tell him my jokes and he continues to give me a blank look, just like he always has. Though he requires a lot of extra care for all his special needs, it is care I am happy to provide in gratitude for the happiness he has brought me. In short, even though he has lost his hearing, arthritis has slowed him down, he sleeps most of the day and cannot participate fully in all of our old antics, he is still my best friend, and encroaching old age will never change that.\nGo beyond the basics.\nTips for Living with a Deaf Dog\nKeep your deaf dog on a leash or in a fenced yard.

Some dogs may bite if startled when they are sleeping.\nDiagnosing a Deaf Dog: The BAER Test\nThink your dog might have hearing loss but aren’t sure?BAER(Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response) is a diagnostic test for hearing whereby a dog is fitted with earphones that extend into the ear. The device emits a sound and the response is detected by tiny electrodes that have been placed on the dog’s head and shoulders. The BAER detects electrical activity in the cochlea of the ear and the auditory pathways of the brain, much like an EKG detects electrical activity in the heart. The resulting waveform definitively shows the degree of a dog’s hearing loss. The procedure is painless, but some dogs might object to wearing earphones. Results are available on the spot.\nWhile curious pet parents sometimes seek confirmation of a hunch that their dog is deaf, BAER testing is used routinely by breeders, primarily those whose breeds are susceptible to congenital deafness. Coat-color-related deafness is common among some white-coated and merle breeds, such as Dalmatians and Australian Shepherds. (To find out which breeds are most affected, see Louisiana State University’s Dr. George M. Strain’s comprehensivelist.) Deaf puppies may play harder than their littermates because they cannot hear the yelps they inflict. They may also be hard to wake or struggle to follow cues from the other puppies.\nThose who train working dogs also utilize BAER testing. These dogs need to be able to hear in both ears in order to localize the source of a sound. (A dog can be unilaterally deaf — deaf in one ear — so that they can still hear but cannot tell where the sound is coming from.) Others, whose dogs experience chronic ear infections, turn to BAER testing to find out how much hearing loss may have been caused by an ear infection. BAER testing is also used to aid in the diagnosis of more serious medical conditions, such as vestibular (inner ear) disease or brain tumors.\nBAER testing can be done only at one of the centers that specialize in the test.

    "title": "Tips on Managing a Multi-Dog Household",

  },
  "page_content": "Have you ever consideredgetting a second dog? How about a third dog? What about more? You aren’t alone. It’s hard to resist the allure of those cute scruffy faces. On a typical morning in a multi-dog household, you’re bound to see dogs romping around — playing, zooming, and rolling all in the course of an hour — it’s hard to imagine a better way to start the day.\nHaving a multi-dog household (three or more dogs) means three playmates instead of one and three dogs to comfort you when you’re down. With three, you’re more likely to have a snuggly companion on the couch or bed, and you’ll be welcomed home by three madly wagging tails. And living in a multi-dog household is also better for your dog. For one thing, you’re not solely responsible for their entertainment. They wear each other out when they play in a way that’s impossible for you to replicate.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nDespite the manybenefits of multi-dog homes, there are also costs, and they’re not all financial. Wiping 12 muddy paws or trimming 54 toenails is exponentially more tiresome than dealing with four paws or 18 nails. Walking three leashed dogs can be complicated, especially when your leashes get tangled with those attached to several dogs from another household. And, of course, training three or more dogs is harder than training one or even two, especially when it involves behaviors they tend to do in unison, like barking at the UPS man or rushing to the door when the bell rings. For many people, such training requires more time and patience than they have.\nDealing with aggression in a multi-dog household\nDogs don’t always get along, of course. Although a lot of “aggression” between familiar dogs is ritualized andharmless without biting, it sometimes escalates, especially when a new dog is involved. While researchers have not systematically observed multiple pet dogs living together, a few studies have examined data from canine behaviorists who had been consulted for help with intra-household aggression. Unfortunately, these studies do not involve a comparison group of households whose dogs do get along, which makes many of their findings hard to interpret. Nevertheless, they tend to agree on a few patterns: aggression is often instigated by a newly matured dog or by a new household member against an older dog, is more frequent within same-sex pairs, particularly when both dogs are female.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nAside from avoiding the most common triggers — such asresource guardingin the presence of food or toys; proximity to the pet parent; high-arousal situations, such asgreetingsor preparations to leave; and being together in a confined space, such as a narrow hallway — other treatment recommendations include medications such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and following a “nothing in life is free” program.\nSome canine behaviorists encourage people to consistently favor one dog over the others (e.g., the older or higher-ranking dog) by giving them resources and attention first. Behaviorist Patricia McConnell argues against this because, in her experience, it doesn’t work. She suggests other methods of decreasing intra-household aggression, including training dogs to be in close proximity to one another while waiting in turn for a resource.\nIn one example of dogs highly trained in this method, McConnell asks three Border Collies and a Great Pyrenees to line up, then kneels in front of them holding a pan in which meat has been roasted. By name, she calls one dog forward to lick the pan, then asks that dog to stop licking and back up when it is the next dog’s turn. Her dogs’ body language indicates how muchself-controlthey must exert to succeed in this situation, but succeed they do. The lesson? When dogs learn that they get what they want by politely waiting their turn, they are less likely to bully each other (or you!) as a way to gain resources.\nWhen intra-household aggression is a serious problem, consult a certified canine behaviorist with a background in this type of situation. In addition, it can be very helpful to learn as much as possible aboutcanine communicationto better understand dogs’ interactions. For example, being tuned in to postures and facial expressions that often precede aggression — such as a dog standing very still with his muzzle tightly closed — can allow us to intervene before an attack is launched.\nWho is the leader of the pack?\nMore often than not, multiple dogs do get along. Based on my own experience, I hypothesize that relationships between a household’s humans and dogs, as well as relationships among the humans, influence how dogs get along. People who model peaceful, generous, and courteous behavior create a household culture that dogs, who are highly attuned to social etiquette, recognize. Puppies growing up in such households are especially likely to adopt that culture.\nOne of my favorite group activities involves walking my dogs off-leash in wild areas far from roads. Each dog understands that when I say, for example, “Max, lead!” I will follow the dog who has been singled out so long as they don’t move toward anything dangerous. All my dogs love being the leader yet will relinquish that role when it’s the next dog’s turn — or mine. It’s fascinating to see where each dog chooses to go; their noses lead us to places I might never find. Also, I can relax because I’m not making all the decisions; it’s fun to be a follower for a change. Finally, letting the dogs be in charge helps balance power in the human-dog relationship. None of my dogs has mutinied, which I think effectively demonstrates that we don’t always have to be “the decider” to have well-behaved dogs.\nBased on what scientists know about people, dogs, and their mutual histories, these outings in some ways mimic the original relationship between human hunter-gatherers and canines. Hunters traveled with multiple dogs, some of whom tracked and chased game while others protected women and children when they were out foraging. Since dogs can smell and hear better than we can, as well as see better in the dark, it made sense for our ancestors to sometimes defer to canine judgments about where to go (or not go). Most of the time, you can’t live this way, but you can get a taste of the wild by going on long outings and allowing your dogs to lead.\nRelationship dynamics of multiple dogs\nAnother plus to living with multiple dogs is the opportunity to observe relationship dynamics. Groups of dogs are systems, which means that if any part changes, everything else changes as well. Through such observations, I’ve learned that dogs take their relationships with one another seriously. Old friends whose interest in playing together gradually decreased over the years may be energized when a new dog joins the family, and in turn, they may spend more time playing with one another.\nSeveral years ago, I lived with three female dogs; at one point, they were joined by Osa, a middle-aged male who needed a temporary home. Safi, the undisputed lead dog in my group, had known Osa well five years earlier, and they began playing almost immediately.\nHowever, Safi was by then older and weaker than Osa, and she objected to some of hisrough playmoves. After clearly communicating this several times, she lost patience and moved to discipline him. Instead of submitting, Osa grabbed Safi’s neck and briefly forced her to the ground. Less than a minute later, Safi approached Osa to reconcile (more about this behavior follows), but he ignored her. From that moment on, Safi gave Osa the cold shoulder, refusing to interact with him in any way. The other two females, who had merely witnessed the event, also ceased engaging with Osa, even though both had played with him before. To my amazement, all three females ostracized Osa during the rest of his stay, a full seven weeks. I was reminded of situations in human families in which people refuse to speak to one another for years.\nWatch for reconciliation among dogs\nI urge people who live with several dogs to pay attention to their interactions. One thing to look for is reconciliation behavior. Research shows that shortly after a two-way conflict within their group, dogs and wolves tend to approach the former opponent to do something nice, like touch muzzles or invite play. Dogs and wolves are especially likely to reconcile when they place a high value on a relationship, and “making up” can be a window into their feelings. For example, a dog that sometimes gets grumpy when playing may, a few moments later, offer a muzzle lick. The same study documenting reconciliation in dogs also showed that if the combative parties fail to reconcile shortly afterward, a third dog, uninvolved in the event, is likely to approach the “victim” of the squabble in a friendly manner, perhaps to offer comfort.\nNotice, also, the way dogs who live in the same household behave when they meet another dog. Many times, I have seen them close ranks when an unfamiliar dog exhibits the slightest unfriendly move toward one of their own. If that behavior escalates to a real threat or fight, a dog may intervene directly to defend a housemate. Such defense is particularly striking when a dog supports someone they don’t especially like when they’re at home.\nBecause we’re humans, we focus on our dogs’ relationships with us. But the most amazing thing about dogs is their capacity to become integrated into both human and canine society. In the past, dogs usually lived in multi-dog, multi-human groups. Multi-dog households are, in a sense, their birthright. No matter how much we love our dogs, to be fulfilled, we need other people, and no matter how much dogs love us, they need other dogs to experience and express all of who they are.",

  "page_content": "I have two dogs who used to get along so well. Lately, instead of being his usual sweet self, the younger one has become pushy with my nine-year-old senior dog, and it seems to be getting worse. After three years of harmony, why is my younger dog so rude to her, and will he grow out of it?\nA family is a dynamic social unit, and interactions between members change—a truism that holds for most, if not all, social species, including dogs. While it can be surprising for many pet parents to see such ashift in a relationshipthat used to be so smooth—it’s actually pretty common. Here are five reasons why your dogs may have stopped getting along.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n1. They’re at different ages…\nYounger dogs who’ve been respectful to older dogs often start to assert themselves as they mature and become more confident. Your older dog is likely entering her golden years—even if she’s healthy—she’s probably a little slower, a little less active and perhaps a little quicker to tire. On the other hand, your younger dog is entering the prime of his life—maturing into his full adult status.\nA dog’sdevelopmental stagematters because age is a fundamentally important part of how dogs treat each other and get along. Young adults through middle-aged dogs are usually on the receiving end of deferential behavior from other dogs. This is a huge generalization, and of course, there are tons of exceptions based on individual personalities but on the face of it, your dogs certainly fit the general pattern. Your younger dog is demanding more respect and offering less, while your older dog is not able to command the respect she once did.\n2. They might be resource guarding…\nResource guarding is one of the “usual suspects” when dogs in a household have issues with eachother.Asdogs grow from adolescence to young adulthood, it’s common for them to have an inclination to hoard things or defend treasures. Ifresource guardingis the issue, as the younger dog develops possessiveness issues, he may no longer be willing to defer to the older dog — even if he was previously respectful. Challenges over resources are common, and while his behavior is going to appear disrespectful, he’s actually just asserting his own interests.\n3. The younger dog may just be over it…\nThe younger dog may be saying, “Enough already!” Sometimes, what looks like a younger dog being disrespectful is not what it appears. Your younger dog may be acting less respectful because your older dog has been controlling everything, and the younger one isn’t having it anymore. It’s not unusual for a younger dog to decide that enough is enough with an older dog who’s not been sharing. When the younger dog rejects the older dog’s privilege (as it were), it can appear that the younger dog is being disrespectful, but it’s really quite reasonable for him to stop his across-the-board deference.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\n4. They have conflicting personalities…\nIndividual personalities influence how (and if) this age-related dynamic playsout.It’spretty common to see dogs who are two to three years old behaving less respectfully to dogs in their household as they get older, especially towards dogs age seven or more. However, personality also plays a role. Like humans, dogs’ personalities likely change over time. Maybe one dog likes to wrestle, and the other doesn’t. Some dogs may be more interested in toys, food, space, attention, or any number of things, while others are wholly unconcerned. If your dog has a strong interest in something, he is likely to assert himself — it’s part of thenatural canine social order.\n5. There could be a health problem…\nThen there are all the age-related physical problems that can impact an older dog’s relationships. Whether thepain and discomfortcomes from conditions likearthritis, hip dysplasia, orjoint stiffness, dogs with physical issues may be irritable or short-tempered. Compounding the problem, those physical issues can result in a lack of sleep for the older dog, which will add to their irritability. An irritable older dog may not be as sweet and kind as usual, making them seem unpredictable or even scary to a younger dog. It’s only natural that the younger dog acts differently in response, and that can mean behaving less deferentially and more assertively.\nAge-related mobility, vision, and hearing problems can also contribute to the deterioration of a previously harmonious relationship. A dog with such issues may not be able to communicate clearly with body language or may not respond appropriately to the younger dog because of an inability to see or hear that dog’s signals. Miscommunication can lead to both confusion and anxiety for the younger dog and they might respond with behavior that seems downright rude.\nThey won’t grow out of it.\nSo now that you know why your dogs aren’t getting along anymore, what’s next? Well, their relationship is going to keep changing. Don’t hitch your wagon to the idea that your dog will grow out of it. Your younger dog will continue to mature, and your older dog will continue to age, so this change in the dynamic between the two of them is unlikely to be temporary.

  "page_content": "Consider this scene from an obedience class for adolescent dogs: Denny, a male Rottweiler, and Meadow, a female Doberman, investigate one another. Denny circles Meadow and tries to mount her from behind for the third time in a row. This proves too much for her. In an instant, Meadow’s lips retract as her body becomes tight, and before we know it, Denny is on the ground with Meadow standing over him, growling. Meadow continues to stand over Denny, whose ears curve back and eyes narrow. When Denny licks and paws at her open mouth, Meadow’s demeanor softens. She steps away and, facing him, folds into a deep play bow. They dance away from their humans like big, romping puppies as we release a collectively held breath.Most of the pet parents there feared the interaction would end badly. However, Denny and Meadow were not strangers to one another. They had played together regularly in a previous puppy class, but this was the first time they had interacted in a way that raised questions about exactly what they were up to. Were they fighting? Should we have allowed their interaction to play out, or does anything that looks like aggression between dogs immediately call for intervention?\nWhat Does Dog Aggression Look Like?\nBecause we live withmultiple dogs, study dog behavior and work professionally with aggressive dogs, we think a lot about canine aggression. Some dog interactions clearly qualify as aggressive — for example, a dog with a history of initiatingunprovoked attacksand inflictingdamaging bitesis clearly aggressive, and letting them interact with other dogs is dangerous. No one would disagree about this. However, what about cases where teeth are flashing, spit is flying and the growling is deafening, but in the end, neither dog is injured? This is a gray area that is so very interesting precisely because it’s often not clear-cut. Are these instances of aggression?\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nThe answer depends upon whom you ask. Even among behavioral scientists, the term “aggression” can have so many meanings that, in effect, it has lost its meaning. For example, behaviorists might use the word “aggressive” not only to describe a dog who has killed another dog but also to describe a dog who growls or snarls at a dog who is trying to take their bone. The motivations and emotions are clearly very different in these two examples. In the first case, the dog intended to do harm and did, but in the second case, the dog was likely just communicating their displeasure. Using the same word to describe two completely different scenarios can affect how we think about and respond to a wide variety of dog interactions.\nWhat’s the Difference Between Aggressive and Agonistic Behavior?\nPerhaps a more useful term to describe growling at a potential bone thief or the interaction between Denny and Meadow is “agonistic behavior.” Ethologists, who often use this term when studying nonhuman animals, define agonistic behaviors as those that occur between individuals of a particular species in conflict situations.\nExamples of agonistic behaviors in dogs include threats like muzzle-puckering and growling; submissive behaviors like crouching, lowering the head and tucking the tail; offensive behaviors like lunging and snapping; defensive behaviors like retracting the commissure (lips) while showing the teeth; and attacking behaviors like biting. With the exception of biting that results in punctures or tears, none of these behaviors necessarily indicates intent to do harm.\nAgonistic behaviors simply reveal emotion (e.g., anger or fear), communicate intention (e.g., to maintain control of a resource or to avoid an interaction) or function as a normal part of play fighting (e.g., growling, snapping or inhibited biting). To determine if an interaction meets the criteria for “agonistic behavior,” an observer must focus on an objective description of the communicative patterns displayed rather than automatically jumping to judgments associated with the use of the term “aggression.”\nSo Why Do Dogs Growl If They’re Not Aggressive?\nIf signals such as bared teeth and growling are not typically preludes to fighting, why do they exist? Paradoxically, such behaviors are usually about how to avoid fighting. To understand this contention, we need to understand wolves — or, for that matter, our own evolutionary history. Wolves, like our human ancestors, live in family-based groups whose members cooperate to hunt, defend resources and rear young. At the same time, as we know all too well, family members quarrel.\nWhen your dog growls, they’re expressing their emotions. A study found that you’ll likely be able to understand what they’re feeling.\nHumans negotiate and move beyond such conflicts with phrases like, “Don’t do that,” “Hey, that’s mine!” “Leave me alone!” or “I’m sorry.” Wolves (and many other social animals) convey similar meanings with a varied repertoire of gestures, postures, facial expressions and sounds, including those mentioned earlier as examples of agonistic behavior. Precisely because they employ such signals, wolves can resolve conflicts without hurting each other. This is an important consideration, because serious wounds in any adult can reduce a pack’s viability as a cooperative unit. Fortunately, dogs, as descendants of wolves, have retained many of these behaviors as well as the motivation — most of the time — to avoid dangerous fights. (One study* reported that none of 127 agonistic interactions observed at a dog park resulted in injury.)The interaction between Denny and Meadow is a good example of this process. Meadow conveyed the equivalent of “Stop trying to mount me!” when she stood over Denny, growling. Through his submissive expressions and gestures, Denny indicated that he accepted her discipline. Meadow responded to Denny’s submission by stepping away, and her play bow showed that she had no hard feelings. Denny’s willingness to play with Meadow indicated that he, too, wanted to remain friends. While we often rush to intervene in such interactions, you can almost hear the dogs saying, “No big deal!”\nOk But What If Your Dog Is a Major Grouch?\nOur last example involves Tex, a 50-pound mixed-breed we rescued from an unhappy life when he was about six months old. He is now five and has never bitten another dog. However, Tex is a bit of a grouch. For example, when he first met Zelda, a young adult female German Shepherd, he rushed at her repeatedly, opening and closing his mouth and vocalizing, “rah-rah-rah.” At first, Zelda showed mild submission and avoidance. Then, as Tex continued with his displays, she stood quietly when he charged, going about her business as soon as he moved away. When they met again the next day, Tex growled at Zelda a few times, but soon they began to play, and from that moment on, they played for hours whenever they were together. Although they clearly like each other, now and then Tex eruptsvocallyat Zelda, who ignores him. She is like the person who has a friend with a bit of a temper, learns not to feed it and loves him anyway.\n7 signs your pup and their pal have BFF potential.\nThe point of this story is not that everyone should allow their dogs to interact with grumps like Tex. Zelda’s guardian was a friend who was familiar with Tex and knew that he was harmless, despite his tendency to show agonistic behavior toward an unfamiliar dog. Although we might prefer that dogs always greet one another with laidback ears and loosely wagging tails, we wonder how many dogs like Tex are out there, doomed to a life without canine company simply because they don’t conform to our ideas about how dogs should behave? If we can learn to discern nuances in agonistic behavior, perhaps more dogs will get a chance to enjoy friendships with other pups.So, the next time you witness an agonistic interaction between two dogs known to have goodbite inhibition, instead of intervening at the first sign of a curled lip or growl (especially when the dogs have a generally amicable relationship), wait a moment and watch. If the interaction ends quickly with no injuries to either party, chances are you have witnessed a useful episode of communication. Sometimes, we need to trust that the dogs really do know best.\nMany incidents of seeminglyaggressivebehavior between dogs are simply examples of appropriate communication. Dogs (including puppies) often recognize this even when we don’t but here are some limitations to this idea:1. When we say that most conflicts are resolved without fighting, we are referring to puppies or adult dogs who have interacted frequently with other dogs and don’t have a history of injurious biting. Such socialization is critical, not only to help dogs learn how to use agonistic signals appropriately, but also to counteract a tendency in some dogs to view unfamiliar dogs as potential enemies.2. When we suggest that it is sometimes appropriate to allow agonistic behaviors to proceed without intervention, we are referring to pairs of well-socialized dogs who already know each other. Before first introducing two dogs — even well-socialized ones — the pet parents should exchange information about each dog’s history and personality and then proceed with caution until the dogs repeatedly interact in friendly ways.3. Pet parents may need to intervene sooner rather than later when one dog within a pair is especially vulnerable — for example, in conflicts between large and small dogs or those involving old dogs. Additionally, if arousal increases rapidly in one or both dogs with no signs of abatement, it is wise to avoid further escalation by interrupting and redirecting the dogs.4. We are referring only to pair-wise agonistic interactions. Once a third dog becomes involved, intervention may be needed to prevent two or more dogs from ganging up against another. Finally, we’re mostly discussing interactions outside of play.",

  "page_content": "What do words mean to dogs? Do you sound like Charlie Brown’s teacher—just a series of ‘wah wah wahs’—or does your dog genuinely understand your words? Are dogs on the same page as us, or even in the same book? This article will explore dogs and their understanding of human language.\nHow much do people think dogs understand? A lot. According to a study by Péter Pongrácz and his colleagues at the Family Dog Project in Budapest. Thirty-seven owners provided a list of 430 different utterances that they thought their dogs knew, with each owner providing an average of 30 phrases.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nSome dogs like Chaser (the dog who knows 1,000+ words) are celebrated for their panache for human language. The news media hails them as “super smart,” and after meeting Chaser, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson exclaimed, “Who would have thought that animals are capable of this much display of intellect?” So, what are these dogs doing with words?\nLet’s look at the types of words that dogs understand.\nDogs can learn the names of many, many, many different objects. Julia Fischer, group leader at the German Primate Center’s Cognitive Ethology Lab, heard that a Border Collie named Rico knew the names of 70 individual objects, and she wanted to know how Rico mapped specific human words to particular objects. “I contacted the owners, and they let us visit their home and start a study of Rico,” explains Fischer. This culminated in 2004 with an article inScience, reporting that Rico knew the names of over 200 different objects.\nSeven years later, Chaser, a Border Collie in South Carolina, took the gold medal when Alliston Reid and John Pilley of Wofford College reported that Chaser knew the distinct names of 1,022 objects — more than 800 cloth animals, 116 balls, 26 Frisbees, and 100 plastic items. This is not merely a story about Border Collies, however. There’s also Bailey, a 12-year-old Yorkshire Terrier, that researchers found knew the names of about 120 toys.\nDogs also win praise for their ability to learn and retain the names of new objects. When presented with a group of toys, all of which were familiar except one, both Chaser and Rico could retrieve the unknown toy when asked to fetch using an unfamiliar word. In essence, the dogs were pairing a novel object with an unfamiliar name after a single association and then remembering the name of that new object in subsequent trials. In children, this is called “fast mapping,” and it was thought to be uniquely human. Pilley notes, “This research shows that this understanding occurs on a single trial. However, Chaser needed additional rehearsal in order to transfer this understanding or learning into long-term memory.”\nBut life is not only about knowing the names of one’s stuffies and Frisbees. Humans often use verbs such ascome,sit,downandoffto get dogs to alter their behavior. After controlling for external contextual cues, researchers found that dogs could still understand that specific words map to specific physical actions. Chaser showed an incredible amount of flexibility with actions — performing “take,” “paw,” and “nose” toward different objects.\n“That’s just training,” you might say, but this suggests that some dogs show a cognitively advanced skill where actions are understood as independent from objects. Reid and Pilley found that Chaser did not interpret “fetch sock” as one single word, like “fetchsock.” Instead, she could perform a number of differentfetchactions flexibly toward a number of different objects. Daniela Ramos, a veterinary behaviorist in São Paulo, discovered that a mutt named Sofia could also differentiate object names from action commands, suggesting these dogs attend to the individual meaning of each word.\nChaser could assign objects to different categories based on their physical properties; some are “toys,” others are “Frisbees” and, of course, there are “balls.” Chaser takes her cue from Alex, Irene Pepperberg’s African Grey Parrot, who also learned categories like color, shape, and material and differentiated which trait was the same or different.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nIs it training or something more?\nThis all seems quite extraordinary, but nothing comes free of controversy. Do dogs understand words the same way humans do or are they merely well-trained? For example, some researchers are not certain that dogs actually “fast map”; dogs might be doing something that simply looks like “fast mapping” from the outside. Regardless, it does seem as though these dogs have a conception of objects and actions.\nPatricia McConnell, PhD, Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist, agrees. “Understanding requires that we share the same reference — that we have the same construct of an object or an action. For some dogs, it seems like they do.” Pilley concurs. “When an object, such as a toy, is held before Chaser and a verbal label is given to that object, Chaser understands that the verbal label refers to that object.”\nIn her bookInside of a Dog,Alexandra Horowitzreminds us that even if these are the only dogs in the world capable of using words this way, it allows us to see that a “dog’s cognitive equipment is good enough to understand language in the right context.” This body of research indicates what is possible, not necessarily what most dogs do every day.\nHow does your dog stack up?\nWhether you have ageniusin your home might largely depend on you. As Fischer explains, “A dog’s use of human language depends very much on the willingness of the owner to establish a verbal relationship, to establish links between words and particular meanings.” Fischer is referring to motivation in both the human and the dog.\nRamos and her colleagues trained and tested Sofia two to three times a day, three to six times a week. When Pilley, who doubled as researcher and Chaser’s parent, began training Chaser to identify objects at five months of age, Pilley repeated object names 20 to 40 times each session to make sure she got it.\nLike Rocky Balboa preparing for his climactic showdown, these dogs are highly motivated. Fischer notes, “Rico was eager and hard working. You’d have to tell him, ‘That’s enough. Get something to drink. Take a rest.’”\nDenise Fenzi, a professional dog trainer from Woodside, Calif., who specializes in a variety of dog sports, reminds us that this type of motivation is not necessarily the norm. “Not all dogs share thisattentionto words. Even in my dogs [all of whom are the same breed], there is a huge difference in the ability to verbally process. I didn’t train them differently. It’s just easier for one to quickly get words.”\nHow you train your dog matters.\nThe way dogs learn words might be the biggest piece of the puzzle. McConnell finds, “Word learning might depend upon how words are first introduced. People who explicitly differentiate words, teaching, ‘Get your Greenie! Get your ball,’ often have the dogs with big vocabularies. On the other hand, my dog Willie was given verbal cues for years that stood for actions rather than objects. When I tried to teach him that words could refer to objects, he was completely confused.”\nWhat dogs are able to do with language could also be explained by their tutelage. If dogs don’t learn to attach a variety of different actions to a variety of objects, it might be harder for them in the long run to be flexible with human language. Susanne Grassmann, a developmental psychologist and psycholinguist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands explains, “Chaser was trained to do different things with different objects, and she differentiates between what is the object label and what is the action command, meaning what to do with that object.”\nRamos notes that Sofia’s relationship with certain objects was a bit different. “Throughout the training, we always paired ‘stick’ with ‘point.’ As a result, it was difficult for her to perform any other action toward the stick besides ‘point.’ If we had trained her ‘stick: sit,’ ‘stick: point’ and ‘stick: fetch,’ she would have learned that multiple actions can be directed toward the stick, and her response would probably be different. For example, when presented with a novel object, such as a toy bear, she could direct a number of different actions toward the bear, but there was a reluctance to change her action towards the stick, which could have to do with the rigidity of training.”\nAnd even if you do explicitly teach that different words have different meanings, it can be challenging. Ramos found that learning the names of objects is not always easy for dogs. “It was hard for Sofia to learn to discriminate the names of her first two objects, but after the initial discrimination, it was like she learned to learn. It became easier,” recalls Ramos. “Because this type of learning can be challenging, service dogs [who have little margin for error] are taught a limited, but instrumental, set of words,” explains Kate Schroer-Shepord, a qualified guide dog instructor at Guiding Eyes for the Blind in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.\nPilley found that dogs’ success at object learning depended upon the training method used. “When we put two objects on the floor and asked dogs to retrieve each object by name, they couldn’t do it; simultaneous discrimination wasn’t working. Instead, Chaser was able to learn the names of objects through successive discrimination. She would play with one object in each training session, and through play, the object assumed value. We’d name the object, hide it and ask her to find it. Discrimination testing between the names of different objects occurred later.”\nDo dogs understand the words or the melody?\nAre these just “type-A” dogs whose accomplishments cannot easily be replicated? After all, most dogs aren’t explicitly taught words as described above, yet they interact with us talkers in ways that make us feel like we’re on the same page. “Dinnertime!” “Wanna go for a walk?” “Where’s Dad?” elicit an appropriate “bouncing dog” response. But are most dogs attending to our actual words, or are other factors at play?\nDogs derive an enormous amount of information from contextual cues, particularly our body movements as well as tone and “prosody” — the rhythm, stress, and intonation of our speech. “When people talk to dogs, dogs pay attention to the melody and the mood to predict what is happening or what will happen next,” explains Fischer.\nFenzi says that dogs can just as easily respond to gibberish as to real English words; “I could go through every level of AKC obedience from the bottom to the top saying, ‘Kaboola,’ and the dog could succeed.” In many cases, dogs may beunderstanding tonerather than individual words.\n“One of the most notable differences between novices and professional trainers is the ability to modulate the prosodic features of their speech,” notes McConnell. “The pros learn to keep problematic emotions out of their verbal cues, like nervousness in a competition, and to use prosody to their advantage when it’s advantageous, for example, to calm a dog down or to motivate them to speed up.”\nIn another study, Ramos explored whether dogs knew the words relating to toys they were thought to know when taken out of context. Most did not, much to the surprise of the people. When the verbal skills of Fellow, a performing German Shepherd from the 1920s, were tested outside their customary contexts, Fellow knew only some of the words and actions that his person thought he understood.\nWhile many pet parents deem their dogs to be word-savvy, their reports tell a different story. The Pongrácz survey found that many words and phrases were executed only in contextually adequate situations (for example, saying “bedtime” when it’s dark and you’re in your pajamas rather than at noon when you’re in your work clothes). As with Fellow, this suggests dogs might not be attending to only words themselves.\nPut words to the test.\nDoes your dog understand your words as you intend them, or do they have a different understanding? If you always use a word in the same context, it’s easy to assume that you and your dog define it identically. Changing the context in some way offers a better understanding of what the dog perceives.\nMcConnell initially thought Willie knew the name of her partner, Jim. “Toteach my dog to findthem, I would say, ‘Where’s Jim?’ and Jim would call Willie over. When Willie consistently went to Jim, I’d say it as Jim was driving up, and Willie would run to the window. One day, Jim was sitting on the couch, and I said, ‘Where’s Jim?’ and Willie ran to the window, all excited. This difference in definitions is more common than people realize — dogs don’t have the exact same concept of words that we do.”\nWhile there is no question dogs can understand verbs, their definitions might differ from ours. McConnell shares a classic example that she learned from Ian Dunbar, founder of the Association of Pet Dog Trainers. “What do dogs think ‘sit’ means? We think ‘sit’ means this posture we call ‘sitting,’ but if you ask a dog who is sitting to ‘sit,’ they will very often lie down. To them, ‘sit’ might mean get lower, go down toward the ground.”\nMany people tend to overestimate their dogs’ ability with words and assume that dogs and humans have a shared understanding. Because a dog responds in one context and not in another doesn’t mean they are being disobedient. As Tom Brownlee, master trainer with the American Society of Canine Trainers and instructor in Carroll College’s anthrozoology program, candidly advises owners, “If a dog’s not getting ‘it’ — whatever ‘it’ may be — thenyou are doing something wrong. It’s our job to help them understand.”\nWhen youtalk to your dog, consider that the words you speak might not carry the same meaning for both of you. Instead, other aspects of the communication might be more relevant. Maybe the real lesson is that context, prosody and tone — rather than dictionary definitions of words — are vitally important for human communication, too.\nGriebel, U., and D.K. Oller. 2012.

  "page_content": "Are dogs the forgiving type? They’re social animals, so it stands to reason that they tend to cooperate and try to minimize conflict. But what happens when there’s asmall dust-upor a fight? While they’ll sometimes just walk away and leave each other alone, other times, they’ll go through a process of reconciliation and make up after thefight.\nReconciliation has been studied in a lot of species — mostly primates — but researchers continue to debate how closely these animal reconciliation behaviors approximate forgiveness, apologies, and other conflict-resolution concepts of humans.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nHow do dogs go from brawling to getting along again, and why do they bother? That’s what a team of researchers at Butler University wanted to answer. Professor Melissa Shyan-Norwalt, PhD, one of the scientists who conductedthis research, has seen cases involving dogs who have bitten their people and then acted “apologetic,” in what seems like a plea for forgiveness. (Other behaviorists, including me, have also seen this phenomenon.) But do dogs forgive other dogs, or do they hold grudges?\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nTheories on dog forgiveness.\nIn this study, researchers watched dogs interacting with one another at a two-acre dog park over eight months to learn more about why dogs might forgive after a fight. During that time, they observed interactions between 177 dogs; most dogs were notlong-term friendsbut strangers or only slightly familiar with one another. As you can imagine, there were plenty of conflicts at thedog park. In reviewing 14 minor fights (with no injuries), the study aimed to test three potential reasons why a dog might choose to forgive.\nOne reason why dogs might forgive is to restore a relationship. In social animals, individuals need each other for food, safety, warmth and all of the other benefits of group living; after a conflict, they need to restore the relationship to good terms.\nAnother hypothesis is that reconciliation would restore the social order and clarify each individual’s status. This suggests that lower-status individuals must act deferentially to others in order to reconcile with them.\nThe last theory is that forgiveness reduces stress and uncertainty around potential future conflict and aggression. By reducing uncertainty, stress levels decline.\nForgiveness brings stress relief.\nIn the end, the study found only one theory matched in this context: uncertainty and stress reduction best explained the behavior of the dogs. They found that both victims and aggressors showed reconciliation behaviors toward one another after a conflict. Both tended to spend more time together after the conflict regardless of if they had an existing relationship.\nWhile it seems dogs do forgive after a fight, there’s still a lot more to learn about reconciliation in dogs. In somemulti-dog households, it doesn’t always work out. Shyan-Norwalt has observed dogs in the same family who did not reconcile but instead separated after every conflict. She points out that even when dogs do reconcile, “it’s important to remember that reconciliation reduces the risk of repeat aggression only in that immediate situation. It does not predict future behaviors. It’s not an apology—it’s ‘that situation is over, let’s move on…’”",

  },
  "page_content": "My 1 1/2-year-old neutered male English Shepherd developed a fascination with light and shadows about nine months ago. He chases any reflections he sees, and on cloudy days, he does the chasing behavior in places where shadows usually appear. He will stand outside under a tree and watch shadows of leaves blowing for 20 minutes at a time. He is an inside/outside dog and gets at least an hour walk each day. The behavior is not destructive, but I worry about the total attention he gives to it, and I don’t want it to get worse. Why does my dog chase shadows, and what should I do?\nA fascination with lights and shadows is most common in high-energy, high-drive dogs, and most of the cases I’ve seen have been in herding or hunting breeds who have come from working lines. As in your dog’s case, it often shows up inadolescence. You're right to be concerned because this problem seems to escalate if left to its own devices, and I worry that it may already be affecting your dog’s quality of life.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nMany dogs who start with a little chasing of shadows can degenerate into cases of full-blown obsessive-compulsive disorder. If that happens, additional compulsive behaviors may develop. Because of the potentially serious nature of this problem, it is worth having your dog evaluated by a veterinary behaviorist in your area who understands anxiety disorders. Also, a change in diet sometimes helps dramatically and is worth a try.\nPrevention is a critical part of helping to extinguish the behavior, so whenever possible, keep your dog out of situations that elicit it. Obviously, you cannot eliminate lights and shadows from your dog’s life, but even simple steps such as hanging dark curtains, spending time with your dog in the rooms with the fewest lights and shadows, and temporarily storing particularly reflective items can help.\nTheir toes might smell like Fritos, but there’s no way they tastethatgood.\nYour response when your dog begins to chase light or fixate on shadows will have a big impact on his behavior. Let your motto be:Interrupt and redirect, but never punish. Interrupt the behavior and try to redirect him to some other sort of behavior. Try to distract him with a favorite toy or use a new squeaky toy to get his attention. Consider rattling his leash and heading out for a walk if that works to distracts him. (Don’t do this last one too often or he may learn to chase shadows in order to get you to take him out.)\nThe interruption should distract your dog, but should never scare him. Good options for redirection include tug, fetch, the ever-popularfrozen Kong, a chew toy, outdoor exercise, or a training session. It can be tempting to respond in a negative way to this behavior, but any punishment carries the risk of making the behavior worse.\nAn hour walk each dayis enough for many dogs, but additional exercise for a young, active dog so interested in light and shadows is really important. Off-leash running for an hour or more a day (or better yet, twice a day) can really make a big difference, as can tiring activities such as fetch and swimming. I realize that finding safe places to do this is often the biggest challenge. Physical exercise can greatly help this problem, but so can additional mental exercise. Giving your dog’s mind more to do may help as much as the physical exercise. Give himenrichment toysthat tax his brain, teach him tricks daily, or attend classes.\nIf you feel that your dog's light obsession is worsening or is more noticeably affecting the quality of his life (or yours!), consider talking to a qualified veterinarian about medicine for obsessive-compulsive behavior and trying complementary medical therapy such as Chinese medicine or homeopathy.",

  "page_content": "My dog Millie, a five-pound Yorkshire Terrier, and I do almost everything together. We hike, camp, watch sporting events, grocery shop, spend all day at the bookstore and visit research labs. Everywhere we go, people are attracted to her; they want to hold her, pet her or just say hi. Why do so many people think she is so cute? Is she perceived as cute because of her looks or her behavior? As it turns out, cuteness is influenced by both physical attributes and behavior, factors that affect the perception of cuteness in a variety of animal species.\nThe science behind Kindchenschema.\nLike many infant animals, babies and puppies have several things in common: large heads, round faces, big eyes. These appealing traits have a name:Kindchenschema(baby schema). A concept introduced by Konrad Lorenz in 1942, baby schema is defined as “a set of infantile physical characteristics ... [that] motivates caretaking behavior in other individuals, with the evolutionary function of enhancing offspring survival.”\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nResearch by Kringelbach and others suggests that this baby schema may extend beyond physical characteristics to include “positive infant sounds and smells.” It’s not hard to imagine that these findings could also be applicable topuppy whimperingand barking, and that unmistakable puppy odor.\nTo pet parents, awhimpering dog sounds as sad as a crying baby. Here’s why.\nA preference for kindchenschema occurs early in human development. In astudy, researchers used eye tracking to determine that both children and adults looked longer at pictures rated high in infantile characteristics than at those rated low. This held true for pictures of humans, cats and dogs. And as research by Dekay and McClelland has shown, humans like animals who appear more humanlike; our concern for the well-being of a species correlates strongly with the species’ similarity to ourselves.\nThis partially explains whypet parentshave a tendency to anthropomorphize their companion animals. I often talk to Millie as though she canunderstand every word, and I put her in her bed and arrange everything for her comfort, much as I did for my son when he was small. Some persist in treating their dogs like children even when it clearly aggravates the dog. Although it might not bother all dogs, most dogs you see wearing cute clothing and bows in their hair would probably prefer no clothing or no bows. (When groomers put a bow on Millie, she has a fit and usually manages to remove it on the car ride home.)\nBehaviors such as handshaking, rolling over, speaking on command or engaging in unusual tricks also influence our perception of a dog’s cuteness. Conversely, specific behaviors can also detract from a dog’s cuteness quota. Excessive barking, aggression or chewing everything in sight tends to diminish our perception of exactly how cute a dog is.\nWhy are dogs so cute?\nThis biological hardwiring has an evolutionary advantage. The human response to cuteness includes protective behavior, a willingness to care for the animal and increased attention, all things that can be good for the dog. Initially, I became interested in cuteness and its influence on humans after talking with a researcher at Eastern Kentucky University who studies perception. His work focuses on the affect of canine head tilt on a dog’s “cuteness” rating. One of the things he’s found is that the same dog can receive different ratings depending on the degree of tilt.\nIn anotherstudy, participants were asked to rate the attractiveness of pictures of puppies ranging from newborn up to seven months. Three breeds (Jack Russell Terrier, Cane Corso and White Shepherd) were studied using 13 pictures of each breed. All pictures showed the dogs’ heads close up and in the same basic posture. The Jack Russell Terrier was considered most attractive at seven weeks old, the Cane Corso at six weeks and the White Shepherd at eight weeks.\nHaving optimal cuteness around the age that puppies are weaned and their mothers lessen parental care matches the hypothesis that puppies being their most adorable from the human perspective has an adaptive function. That function is to encourage adoption and care by humans just when the mother dogs are winding down their care of the puppies. One way to maximize the chance of human care is to look their very cutest at just the age when they transition from being cared for by their mother to being cared for by people. This finding may help explain how it is that puppies evolved to receive human care so extensively.\nThis type of research has direct application to the dog adoption process. As mentioned, cuteness induces protective behavior, which often leads to positive human-dog interactions. It follows that these feelings may result in a decision to adopt the dog who elicits them and to overlook those who don’t.\nBecause the well-being of dogs is heavily dependent on their relationships with humans, it’s important to understand that these often-unconscious biases affect our choices. There’s nothing wrong with loving a cute dog—as I do Millie—but dogs of all sorts need love, and their value should not be determined by how cute we think they are.",

  "page_content": "Puppies acquired during lockdown have been missing out on critical socialization experiences and training, which is known to be associated with stress-induced behaviors ranging fromnervousness to fear-based aggression.\nPeople around the world have been spending more time at home since the start of 2020. For many of these people, this seemed like the perfect opportunity to get a pet. In the UK alone, an estimated3.2 million householdshave acquired a pet since the start of the pandemic. Dogs were the most popular new acquisition (57%), with cats a close second (38%). This sudden increase in pet ownership raises concerns about pet welfare.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nIt isn’t just the pandemic pets that may be showing signs of stress or behavioral issues. Life hasn’t been normal for many dogs for most of the past few years. They’ve had less interaction with other dogs, fewer visitors coming into the home, and little time alone since the pandemic began.\nFewer interactions have caused more stress.\nThis has led to a noticeable change in dog behavior.Growling, snapping or nippingchildren when approached and handled by them increased by 57% during the lockdown. Google searches for “dog bark” and “dog bite” increased by 48% and 40%, respectively, suggesting some aspects of the lockdown period were particularly challenging for our pets.\nHey, man. It’s all about those chemical messengers. See how Adaptil can help your pup.\nAs humans, we tend to focus on situational stress — work deadlines, or paying bills. But stress can be caused by anything that upsets the body’s hormone balances. The presence of stressor results in a hormone cascade, culminating in the release of glucose that provides a burst of energy designed to help escape the stressor. This sets off the fight, flight or freeze response.\nStressors range from a physical threat, such as a predator, to an unpredictable environment, which our pets might be experiencing now lockdown restrictions ease. This isn’t limited to dogs. Changes to routine, particularly feeding schedule, have been shown to inducestress in cats, birds,sheepandhorses.\nIs your dog stressed?\nSigns of stress in your dog may be obvious, such as destructive behavior or vocalizing. But, there are also more subtle signs of stress in dogs, such as panting or drooling, pacing, repeatedly checking windows and doors, or chewing or scratching themselves.\nLockdown may, unfortunately, have a long-term impact on pets’ ability to cope when left home alone. Dogs that had separation anxiety before the restrictions started are likely to get worse when left again as owners head back to work. But we also expect to see new cases developing, because other dogs, and particularly puppies, have learned to expect company all day.\nResearch last yearshowed that 82% of pet parents surveyed noticed an increase in their dog whining or barking when a household member was busy. There was a 41% increase in reports of dogs being clingy or following people around the house during the lockdown. All of these can be indicators of separation anxiety developing.\nHow to help a stressed dog:\nThe good news is, it’s not too late to prepare your dog and to teach them vital skills that they can apply in any situation. If you’re starting to spend more time outside of the house, you need to remember that this change in routine is stressful for your pets. Start preventative measures now to avoid future problems.\nIf you have a dog who was previously used to being left alone, make sure you maintain their ability to cope with this by introducing periods of separation during the day when you are in the house – such as placing them behind a baby gate whilst you are working from home. Leave your dog at home for short periods of time.\nTrain your dog to stay calm when they’re on their own — instead of sad-singing“All By Myself”until you come home.\nBuild up the amount of time your dog is separated from family members gradually and associate it with something positive, such as a long-lasting treat. Monitor how your dog responds, and shorten the time left if they show any signs of anxiety.\nWhere dogs are already showing signs of separation anxiety (such as barking, howling, toileting, or being destructive when left), seek help from your vet in the first instance. Avoid looking for “quick fix” solutions like anti-bark collars or punishing your dog on return. These approaches will likely exacerbate the problem and result in more serious and more difficult-to-treat problems in the long run.\nTeaching dogs to be relaxed when left takes time and patience, particularly for the pandemic puppies that have rarely been away from their pet parents. But making the effort to show your dog that being alone is not stressful, using our advice, can prevent serious problems that are much more difficult to treat later in life.\nThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

  "page_content": "Many dogs bark at things they see through the car window — most commonly people and other dogs, but also sometimes cars,trucks, motorcycles, kids on bikes, cats, skateboarders, and scooters. Some dogs bark when they see these same things in a different context — perhaps from home or while out on walks — but others only react like this when they’re in the car. And dogs who react in multiple contexts often bark especially vigorously when in a car.\nThere’s something about the confined space of a vehicle that tends to make this behavior more likely — and more intense. It could be that the dog feels trapped, and, therefore, is more reactive. Or, maybe they feel more secure, and that confidence makes them more reactive.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhatever the reason, it’s common for dogs to struggle to remain calm at the sight of various triggers on the other side of the car window. Fortunately, there are a few things you can do about it.\nFigure Out Your Dog’s Triggers\nThe first step toward improving your dog’s behavior is to figure out the specific triggers that cause them to bark. Do they bark at all people, or just big men? Is it all dogs, or only small white ones, or only those who are barking? Does every motorcycle cause your dog to go nuts, or is it only those that pass the car? Is it every vehicle, or only trucks?\nOnce you’ve that figured out, determine what your dog loves that can feasibly and safely be given to them while in the car. Is a new toy the top option? Or maybe a stuffed Kong? If they like treats, which treats make them the happiest: chicken, steak or a specific training treat?\nOnce you’ve determined what sets your dog off and what they love, the next step is to repeatedly pair them up so that every time they’re exposed to a trigger, they get that thing, along with lots of praise. Praise is very important, particularly since it can be given even when you’re driving by yourself.\nWhen a trigger is present, give your dog lots of happy talk and then, as soon as you safely can — at a stoplight or by pulling over — provide the treat. (Try practicing this when you have two people in the car so your dog learns that praise means treats are coming soon.)\nSuccess requires considerable attention to the many details involved in this type of pairing, including: presenting the trigger in a low-intensity way so your dog doesn’t react, safely delivering the treat and praise as soon as possible (immediately is ideal), and gradually increasing the intensity of the trigger over many training sessions.\nHow to Stop Your Dog from Barking in the Car\nTo begin, conduct training sessions when the car is parked. That makes the whole situation less intense for most dogs, presumably because the environment is stable rather than constantly changing as the world whizzes by.\nSit in the car with your dog, give them a treat, and speak to them in an upbeat tone of voice every time their trigger appears. For example, if their issue is that they bark at people, toss them some great treats and praise them every time a person comes into view. (The same process applies to other triggers as well, but for the purpose of this discussion, I will continue to use people as the example.)\nIdeally, you can toss the treats and talk in a happy way before your dog has a chance to react, but if that’s not possible, give them the treats (and the happy talk) even if they do bark. Receiving the treats is not contingent on their behavior. They do not have to sit, lie down, look at you, or be a “good dog” in any other way to receive the treats. That’s because you’re not training your dog to perform a behavior — you’re teaching them to associate the appearance of people with treats and positive speech, which has nothing to do with their behavior. Once your dog learns to feel happy about the sight of people, they won’t bark at them.\nOne way to improve your timing at delivering treats before your dog starts barking is to orchestrate the situation. This can be done by having a friend or two walk by your parked car at a distance, or by parking your car at a significant distance from where people are likely to be walking — say, at the far end of a shopping-center parking lot. The goal is to keep your dog under threshold (in a state where they are not reacting) and to deliver the treats and happy talk the instant a person is visible. Timing is important because the more closely you’re able to link the sight of the person and the delivery of the treats and praise, the easier it will be for your dog to make the connection between the two.\nAs your dog begins to make this association, you may notice that when they see a person, they’ll look at you expectantly, in anticipation of treats. Once they seems relaxed and happy about seeing people, and especially if they seems to expect treats, the next step in your training is to increase the intensity of the trigger, perhaps by reducing the distance or choosing a person who is more of a challenge because she’s taller or moves more quickly. Continue to work on teaching your dog to like seeing people go by at increasingly close range until they can handle people quite close to the car.\nThe next step in building the association between people and positive items is to teach your dog that it applies when the car is moving. The safest way to do that is with two people in the car — one to drive and one to offer the dog goodies. It’s best to do this for a short time — perhaps just a few minutes — and by driving in an area that’s unlikely to present them with a lot of triggers. If you go on longer drives while training, it’s likely to push your dog’s limits, and your efforts will be less effective.\nA Few Other Helpful Tips\nIn addition to training your dog to be able to handle their triggers without barking, there are other strategies for dealing with barking from the car window that involve prevention and management. For example, one useful option is to teach your dog to lie down in the car, then offer them a stuffed Kong or other item to keep them occupied. This technique will be most effective if you practice it when the car is parked in your driveway and in other peaceful places. It’s easiest for your dog to successfully develop this habit when the car is stationary and there’s nothing to set them off. Once they’re able to settle down in a parked car, they’re more likely to be able to do so in a moving one.\nAnother management technique is to prevent your dog from being able to see out the car windows. If they’re comfortable in acrate, use one in the car and cover it with a blanket. A ThunderCap can also help. It obscures your dog’s vision without blocking it entirely, allowing them to make out shapes and navigate as needed. (Teach your dog to be comfortable wearing it before using it in the car.) ThunderCaps have a calming effect on many dogs in a variety of situations, including barking while riding.\nThe bottom line: Like any behavior change, teaching dogs not to bark from the car window is a gradual process that requires many steps and a lot of practice and patience. Remembering that dogs tend to be happier when they can handle the sight of a person (or other trigger) from the car without reacting will help you stay motivated. Their ability to remain calm also means they’ll probably be going places in the car more often — a win/win no matter how you look at it.",

  "page_content": "Anyone who has lived with a dog will know their capacity for learning the meaning ofwords, even ones you don’t want them to know. How many times have you had to spell the words “walk” or “dinner” in the hope of avoiding an explosion of excitement?\nPrevious studies have investigated how non-human animals, including chimpanzees, sea lions, and rhesus monkeys, learn words. Buta paperpublished in Nature shows some dogs learn the name of a new object after hearing it only four times, an ability previously thought to be confined to humans.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThe researchers found this ability was not common among all the dogs studied; instead, it may be limited to a few “talented” or highly trained individuals. So how can you tell whether your dog is a genius or not?\nTesting Name Recall\nThe study was simple and easy to replicate at home. Just follow the steps the researchers took to see whether your dog can learn the names of objects as quickly. But don’t worry if your dog doesn’t have this ability, it might just be down to their breed or previous experience.\nThe study involved a Collie called Whisky, who knew 59 objects by name, and a Yorkshire Terrier called Vicky Nina, who knew 42 toys.\nThe researchers tested each dogs’ knowledge of their toys by asking them to bring each toy in turn. Neither the pet’s parents nor the experimenters could see the toys, to avoid influencing the dogs’ choice.\nOnce it was established the dogs knew the names of all their toys, the researchers introduced two new objects, placing each in turn in a group of known toys. In this test, Whisky chose the new toy every single time. Vicky Nina fetched the right one in 52.5% of trials, which is slightly above chance.\nAccording to animal behaviorist Karen London, using a more specific terms like“biddable”or“bombproof” can help you better understand your dog.\nLearning New Names\nFor the next part of the study, the dog was shown a toy, told its name and was then allowed toplay with it. After four repetitions of the name of two different new toys, the dog was asked to choose one of the two new toys.\nNo familiar toys were included in this part of the trial, to prevent the dog choosing the right toy by exclusion. If it knows the name of all other toys, the dog might pick the correct toy because it guesses the unfamiliar word must indicate the unfamiliar toy.\nBoth dogs chose the new toy more often than chance would predict, suggesting they were indeed learning the name of a new object very quickly. However, their memory decayed considerably after 10 minutes and almost completely after one hour. This shows the new learning needs more reinforcement if it is to be retained.\nThe test involving the new toy was also carried out by 20 volunteers with their own dogs, but these dogs didn’t show the ability to learn new names after a few hearings.\nThe authors suggested the difference between the performance of the two dogs in their test and the volunteer dogs means, in order to learn new names quickly, the dog might need to be unusually intelligent or to have a lot of experience in learning names.\nIs Your Dog Smart?\nIt seems likely there are a combination of factors at work in these experiments. It’s significant that the breed most commonly used in studies of this type is aBorder Collie, which is purposefully bred to attend to audible commands and is very highly motivated to carry out tasks and to please the handler. Yorkshire Terriers also enjoy mental and physical stimulation.\nSimilar tests have been carried out by other research groups, usually using Border Collies. In 2004,a dog called Ricowas found to know the names of 200 different objects, and in 2011Chaser learned 1,022unique objects.\nOther breeds may simply be less interested in playing with orfetchingtoys. For example, sighthounds, such as Salukis and Greyhounds, are primarily bred for hunting or racing, so are generally more difficult to train. They may show no interest in toys at all, as well as being considerably less motivated to please the handler.\nBoth the experimental dogs in this study were intensively trained, through play and social interaction, topay attentionto the names and characteristics of the toys. This might make them more likely to notice the differences between new and familiar toys and to attend to the verbal cue associated with them.\nAlthough their training was not formal, it was neverthelesspositive reinforcement training, a powerful method for teaching animals and humans. The dogs have undoubtedly learned their skills to a high degree.\nIt’s quite possible to teach all dogs to perform tasks, including learning the names of objects. But the degree to which they’re willing and able to learn, and to carry out the task, is very much regulated by the breed of dog and the level of motivation the individual dog possesses.\nIf your pet is an Afghan Hound or a St. Bernard, you should not expect it to be interested in spending hours fetching toys for you. If, on the other hand, you have a Border Collie or aPoodle, their abilities may only be limited by your imagination and your dedication to playing with them.",

  "page_content": "When it comes to things dogs love, it's safe to say that most enjoy going for walks, eating chicken, getting belly rubs, and chasing squirrels. Sure, there are exceptions, but these truths apply to most dogs. Similarly, there is general agreement around what dogsdon'tlike. At the top of the list? Citrus. Most dogs can't stand the taste and smell of oranges, lemons, and grapefruit. Here's why — plus, how to use their dislike of citrus to your advantage.\nWhy Dogs Hate Citrus\nThe odor of an orange to most dogs is like the odor of trash to most humans — which is pretty gross. We don't know exactly why dogs don't like citrus, but it's probably similar to why us humans have specific scents that we prefer over others.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nTo be fair, a small percentage of dogs actuallylikecitrus — they consider these flavors to be the icing on the cake, so to speak, and are evenmorelikely to go after any object covered with such an odor. (Maybe this is nature’s way of preventing any of us from ever feeling confident that we know what's going on with our pups.)\nThanks, they hate it.\nDoes Your Dog Hate Citrus?\nTo see how your dog feels about citrus, peel a messy orange so that your hands are covered with the sticky juice; then, put your fingers near your dog’s nose. If they back away, making anughface, then you’ve got a member of the citrus-hating majority. If your dog licks your fingers, you don’t.\nHow to Use Citrus As a Dog Repellant\nIf your dog dislikes the smell of these acidic fruits, it may be possible to use the scent or juice of them as a deterrent. For a DIY solution, mix concentrated lemon juice with water in a spray bottle. Or, pick up a pre-madedog repellent spray. With some patience and thoughtful training, you can use citrus to help train your dog to stay away from places (or things) you don’t want them to chew or access.\nJust be mindful if you decide to use citrus to scent your home. Whether you are using essential oils or candles, you may inadvertently be making your home smell as bad to your dog as a trash dump would smell to you.",

  "page_content": "Zoomies have been a part of my life far longer than Zoom meetings. I’ve enjoyed watching dogs do the zoomies in the yard or at the park, racing around an open space, as well as inside — leaping over the coffee table and running along the back of the couch. Zoomies are one of the most charming and entertaining of canine behaviors.But why do dogs get zoomies?Below, everything you need to know about dog zoomies.\nScientifically speaking, zoomies are frenetic random activity periods, or ‘FRAPS.’ It has been theorized thatFRAPsallow animals to relieve stress, let out stored up energy, and handle excitement and play — but the function of frapping is still unknown.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nDogs with the zoomies will run in wide circles in a series of laps and may exhibit repetitive spins. They often break into a sprint suddenly; their back end tucked as they go; a wild, excited look in their eyes; and lots of sharp turns, spins, or sudden changes in direction.\nZoomies can happen whendogs get revved upor aroused, when they go out after being inside for a while, when they see another dog, when their favorite person comes home, or in the snow. It’s also common following a few other circumstances: a bath, pooping, grooming, and being released from a crate or any other form of restraint.\nNo less than 7 animal behaviorists weigh in on what’s behindall of this bumping and grinding.\nThere is nothing wrong with this normal dog behavior — as long as your dog doesn’t run around in a place that is unsafe, such as near a road or through a part of the yard with dangerous objects. Though zoomies are not problematic, sometimes dogs that chase their tails are mistaken for having the zoomies when they’re actually showing symptoms ofobsessive-compulsiveness.\nMost of the time, a case of the zoomies lasts less than a few minutes. Although they have been known to extend upwards of 10 minutes, that is not typical.\nIt’s hard to stop a dog mid-zoom, so it is usually easiest to wait out these short-lived actions. You can redirect their motion by running away from them so they chase you to a safer spot if need be. Or, you can throw a toy in the direction you want a dog to go. The better your dog’s recall, the sooner they will come to you as their zoomies wind down. Whatever you do, don’t chase a dog with the zoomies as that will only add excitement to the moment and make it harder for your dog to calm down.",

  "page_content": "Your senior dog’s routine is pretty simple: Wake up, go to the bathroom, run in for breakfast, find the perfect nap spot, and settle in for several hours. But even they want to mix things up a little. Contrary to the old adage, youcanteach senior dogs new tricks — withadolescenceout of their systems, they tend to focus pretty well on teaching moments.\n“A lot of old dogs get what I call the ‘shrinking world’ syndrome,” says certified veterinary behaviorist Dr. Lore Haug. “Their owners get in a rut with them; they start walking the dog less, and they don’t train the dog or teach them tricks. The dog doesn’t get as much stimulation and enrichment — maybe they stop taking the dog to thedog park— and there’s a significant decline in mental and physical challenges.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhile we may think our older dogs are content to kick back more and interact less, in reality, the opposite is true. Their senses may not be quite as sharp as they once were, and they may not move as quickly, but having fun with their people is still a thrill. It’s also a thrill that can have a positive payback by helping them maintain their cognitive agility as they age. A little time and effort on your part will pay big and ongoing dividends in the overall quality of your dog’s life. Here are a few ideas that will provide your old pup with both physical and mental stimulation and make your dog’ssenior yearsthe best years of their lives.\nLet the games begin.\nEnrichment ideas for senior dogs\nKeep those neurons firing and log some quality time with your dog by playing games that exercise their mind.\nToys are one way tostimulateyour dog both mentally and physically. And while it’s entirely normal for a dog’s passion for toys to wane with age, there are ways to revive it, such as by rotating toys weekly because novelty inspires interest.\nInteractive toys also pique curiosity. If your dog likesstuffed toys, look for those with “parts” that are intended to be pulled out of oroff the toy. There are also toysexplicitly geared toward senior dogsthat could be just what your dog is looking for.\nAn easy way to add some change and excitement isnose work. While your dog is in a sit/stay, hide a treat or toy, then release them to find it. (Cheering them on increases the excitement level.)\nKeep your senior dog’s mind healthy by teaching them anew trick.\nTreats hidden behind panels or under sliding blocks motivate dogs to use both their noses and paws. Swedish-madeNina Ottosson puzzlesset the benchmark in this category.\nTips for treating achy joints — from medications to massages.\nHow toeep your senior dog active\nAn active dog is a happy dog, and that goes for senior dogs, too. Regular exercise keeps your senior dog’s joints limber and muscles strong, helps control weight, and engages the brain — all of which slow the aging process and boost your dog’s quality of life. Not only do active dogs live longer, they live better, andyour bond will grow.\nThe senior years can bring a golden age of walking; not only does walking get your dog moving, but the sights, smells, sounds, and tastes of the worldstimulate their brain. Older dogs have more trouble regulating their body temperature, so avoid exercising when it’s very hot or cold. Keep an eye on your dog for signs of fatigue oroverheating.\nWhile you want to avoid steep hills, walking up gradual hills strengthens your dog’s hindquarters. If your route includes a steep downhill, consider zigzagging your way down to avoid too much stress on your dog’s front legs. Considerbootiesor paw pads with gripping treads to help your dog maintain traction on slippery surfaces.\nAerobic and low-impact, swimming is an ideal senior-dog fitness option, especially during warm months. While lakes or ponds are a fun and free option, submerged rocks or logs can make access tricky for senior dogs, and, in some cases, cold water canexacerbate arthritisor joint problems.\nGet them to master the doggy paddle with these trainer-approved tips.\nCanine pools offer warm water swimming in a setting geared toward older or injured dogs. The warm water helps loosen joints and stimulate circulation while building muscle. Some water therapy centers have underwater treadmills, so non-swimmers can reap the benefits. In all kinds of water, a canine flotation device provides a little extra buoyancy and security for older dogs.\nIf you have ever watched a dog stretch after a nap, you just know they love it. And it’s good for them. Stretching helps keep your dog feeling relaxed while promoting flexibility. You can help these natural processes withgentle guided stretchingof the rear and front legs to benefit the hips, spine, knees, ankles, wrists, elbows, chest, and shoulders.\nMany dog massage books or classes include stretching, or tryDoga, a form of yoga that works with human-dog pairs and incorporates massage. If you cannot find a Doga class in your neighborhood, there are several good DIY guides, includingBarking Buddha: Simple Soul Stretches for Yogi or Dogi.\nCue theSchoolhouse Rock!because learning can be fun.\nBehind every graying muzzle is an inner puppy itching to play. Channel that inner puppy with enriching activities that keep them strong and agile. Three dependable options that provide both physical and mental stimulation for older dogs include:\n• Flatland fetch: For ball lovers with joint issues, retrieving low tosses or rolled soccer balls keeps all paws on the ground. Avoid Frisbee or a game that encourage leaping catches.\n• Gentle tug-of-war: Tug at the dog’s level to keep stress off the neck.\n• Agility lite: Zipping through tunnels, weaving between poles, even pausing on a floor mat (skip the table, jumps, and climbing obstacles) captures the high-thrill fun of agility without the impact.\n5 reasons to get your dog in the agility game, from burning energy to building confidence.\nGet your dog a friend\nPerhaps the ultimate enrichment strategy is to provide your old pal with a canine friend by adopting a new pup. There are lots of caveats here — among other things, not all dogs want to deal with anew dog in their home. But when it works, it works splendidly.\nIf you think your dog might like company, try fostering — ideally, a somewhat younger dog with a compatible personality. Some behaviorists suggest that the best age difference is around three years, while others say there are benefits to a larger spread; the older dog will teach the younger important social skills and appropriate behavior, and the younger dog will keep their elder busy and engaged.\nFor all dogs do to enrich our lives, we owe it to them to make sure their senior years are as enriching and fulfilling as the preceding years have been — and then some.",

  "page_content": "It begins with your dog’s body becoming tense, their ears stand up, and they are staring straight ahead at their worst fear. Coming your direction is a hound roughly four times their size that is clearly eager to investigate your pup, andtheir person appears just as eager to allow them to.\nSure, their dog is friendly, but the problem in this scenario is that your dog — and many other leash reactive dogs like them — has no, zilch, notta single interest in meeting the hound.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nLeash reactivityis when a dog is barking, lunging, and/or growling while on leash in response to the presence of a particular stimulus. When exposed to something that frightens them, such as another dog, these dogs will do their best to send the message that they aren’t ok. You might see a dog pulling on their leash as forcefully as possible and barking ferociously. Putting their behavior into words, I imagine them saying, “Uh-uh! You need to stay away from me! Keep your distance! I said,get the hell away!”\nOften this type of behavior is embarrassing for the pet parents on the other end of the leash. You might even find yourself apologizing for the behavior. However, as a dog trainer with an education in dog behavior and because of years of experience working with dogs, I don’t blame the dog fortheir behaviorone little bit.\nFiguring out why your dog lunges at other dogs.\nIn one training session, my client Rocket, a scrappy terrier mix, no more than 15 pounds, did his very best to prevent a situation that made him feel powerless, uncertain and downright fearful. Yet, Rocket’s worst fears were brought to life as he was on a leash, trapped and unable to stop a much larger dog from doing exactly as he pleased. And unfortunately, Rocket’s pet parent wasn’t having it. She wasembarrassedand frustrated.\nDon’t blame the dog — instead, figure out how to help them succeed.\nBut I explained to her that dogs like Rocket don’t seek opportunities to embarrass their pet parents. He is using thelanguagehe speaks to communicate to other dogs that he does not want to mingle. Again, this could be because he doesn’t like the sensation of being trapped. He may be motivated by an event in his past, perhaps involving a fight. He may simply prefer to have space between him and other dogs. (I’m sure many of us can relate — do you love inspecting your co-worker’s facial pores as he invades your personal space every time you interact?) What Rocket’s behavior should communicate to other dogs is not always respected by other dogs, or other humans, for that matter.\nHow to respond to a dog lunging or barking on leash.\nSo, what is my approach? How do I help the Rockets of this world learn to deal with things that scare them? I decipher their loudly shouted messages, share them with their people, and build each dog’s trust in their people. I create a bridge of communication between human and dog. All of these approaches allow the Rockets to relax a little more with every walk and, consequently, allow their people to relax, too. No need for embarrassment or overwhelming fear. Let’s break down this approach.\nHow do you get the messages your dog is sharing? You need to better understand their body language and their “spoken” language, as well. This can be tough, but many great resources on canine language exist;here’s a good place to start.I’m partial, both from a scientific and ethical perspective to positive reinforcement.\nHow do you build trust between you and your dog? It starts by learning to recognize what your dog is saying, which makes it easier to respond appropriately. Once you identify their fear and your dog’s inability to handle close proximity to another dog or human, it allows you to understand that putting distance between a dog and their feared stimuli providesreassurance. Visual barriers can also calm or soothe a fearful dog.\nWith patience and positive reinforcement, you can do a lot to make up for lost time with socialization.\nNext, and my favorite, how do you build a bridge of communication with a member of another species? One option is to create a shared language; to do this, you train. My training cue of choice for lunging dogs is a form of focus called “look” or “watch.” With proper education and lots of practice, you can ask forattentionfrom your dog as the two of you enter a questionable situation. Asking for focus helps prevent further reactions from the dog. If, thanks to shared communication and distraction techniques, the situation never becomes too frightening, there is no need for the Rocket of this scenario to lunge or send a loud, barking message.\nIt gets better.\nHere’s the best part: at some point, you may not even need to ask for your dog’s focus. With practice, your dog may choose to handle the situation themself by looking at you (rather than lunge or bark) when they encounter a worrisome situation. Let me tell you, this is an exhilarating moment the first time it happens. Even though I’ve seen it hundreds of times, I still want to leap into the air with excitement.\nAs pet parents who have chosen to bring another species into your daily lives, you have an obligation to try to understand what your dogs are telling you. Likewise, you have an obligation to try to improve your relationship using this acquired knowledge.\nThere’s no need to feel embarrassed. Have a “chat” with your dog, and rediscover that walks with your best friend really are one of the best parts of your day.",

    "title": "Understanding Canine Social Hierarchies",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/understanding-canine-social-hierarchies"
  },
  "page_content": "The canine relationships in my house are friendly but complex: My young Collie mix, Jenny, regularly commandeers food and toys from my elderly Golden, Jack, taking them directly out of his mouth. He tolerates this with characteristic patience. This one-way flow of resources from Jack to Jenny might imply that she holds the higher rank in their mini-hierarchy.\nYet, when she greets him after an absence, she does so with classic submissive body language, licking him under the chin. And when he really cares about a particular toy, such as his beloved red ball, he protects it with a quiet growl that she immediately respects. How am I to interpret their social ranking — who is dominant and who is subordinate?\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nOf course pet parents try to interpret the dynamics of their dogs. But pup relationships — and ‘rank’ as it’s referred to in the academic world — matter beyond our observational fascination: Some approaches to training and managing canine aggression are constructed around theories about rank relationships between dogs and humans. But because science hasn’t traditionally considered this particular aspect to be an interesting research area, the depth of our actual understanding of canine social hierarchies leaves much to be desired. However, “dog science” has begun to grow in recent years, becoming a newly respectable field producing more and more data, so that may be starting to change.\nWhat We Don’t Know About Dog Hierarchy\nThe question of how dogs understand and assert rank has been fodder for ferocious contention among dog trainers. The “dominance” theory of dog behavior holds that much of canine aggression is due to an attempt to assert a high rank (in other words, dominance) over a lower-ranking group member. Therefore, aggressive behavior may be reduced by a human display of behaviors associated with high rank in dogs (or their close relatives, wolves).\nFor example, an owner might seek to reinforce her dominant status by ensuring that she passes through doors before her dog, eats before her dog, and never loses a game of tug. This traditional approach is still practiced by many, yet is heatedly debated. Karen London, PhD, CAAB, CPDT, has referred to dominance as “the D-word,” playfully suggesting that it is too offensive a concept to write about.\nDominance theory is not based on a scientific understanding of how to change animal behavior. Dr. Patricia McConnell, PhD, CAAB, called dominance “one of the most misused and misunderstood words in the English language, at least in relation to dog training.” Its practice can actually lead to increased aggression in dogs, potentially resulting in humans being bitten and dogs being surrendered to shelters, or even euthanized.\nScience has not supported us in our quest to understand the relationship between canine rank and aggression. Social hierarchies have been studied extensively in wolves, both captive and wild, and in non-human primates — but rarely in dogs. Traditionally, researchers seem to have perceivedCanis familiaris(aka domestic dogs) as tainted by human intervention — not a natural species and therefore not worthy of study. Domesticated species have traditionally been uninteresting to behavioral ecologists (scientists who study behavior and evolution).\nLack of data about how dogs understand and express rank and the charged environment around the use of rank in explaining dog behavior discourage a nuanced discussion of how often dogs have dominant-subordinate relationships with each other, and how dog social hierarchies are structured. These are important questions as research on canine behavior, once so sparse, begins to flourish.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nWhat We Have Learned\nThe best way to answer questions about how dogs interact is (surprise!) to watch a lot of dog interactions. Behavioral ecologists at Utrecht University in the Netherlands did exactly that, recording the behavior of a group of 10 dogs over the course of two months. It was a young group with only one adult, a two-year-old female Cairn Terrier. The rest were puppies and adolescents under 18 months. In fact, the three highest-ranking dogs were all juveniles: a six-month-old male Beagle, a one-year-old female Malinois and a five-month-old male Doberman.\nEvery morning, the dogs were let out of their individual kennels into an outdoor enclosure. Here, among thousands of group interactions, individual one-on-one exchanges were selected for analysis. Researchers sought answers to specific questions: How strict is the division between animals of different ranks? What does the rank hierarchy of this group look like: a straight line or a looping one? And perhaps most critically, do dogs show aggression to group members of lower rank?\nAs it turned out, this group was not particularly egalitarian. Division between ranks was nearly always strict, requiring a dog to greet his superior, even one just a single rank above him, with deferential behavior such as lowered body posture. However, two pairs of middle-ranking dogs were exceptions to this rule. These pairs of dogs were comfortable interacting with each other without formal rank-signifying behavior. This laxness may suggest that precise rank is less important in the middle of the hierarchy than at the top or in the depths. Alternately, it may signify that these dogs were jockeying for position, attempting to climb just one step higher up the ladder by deferring to their superiors as rarely as they could get away with.\nIndeed, the social hierarchy in this group did resemble a ladder: Some species have a dizzying hierarchical structure, in which rank order may loop in an entirely nonlinear fashion. In this dog group, however, the hierarchy was strictly linear: if dog A was higher ranking than dog B, and dog B was higher ranking than dog C, then dog A would always be higher ranking than dog C. No weird circular messes — occasions, for example, when dog C was surprisingly dominant over dog A — were observed.\nThe question of what behaviors higher-ranking dogs offer their subordinates is key. Did higher-ranking dogs routinely show aggression, as dogs labeled “dominance aggressive” would be expected to do? The researchers observed that higher-ranking dogs greeted their subordinates with high tails and pricked ears, and subordinate dogs responded by lowering their body posture, sometimes breaking into a full-body tail wag. Though some growls and lip-lifts were observed, these behaviors appeared on both sides of the divide, offered from high-ranking dogs to their subordinates, and from subordinates to those higher up the ladder. In this group of dogs, aggressive behavior had absolutely nothing to do with rank. This important piece of data further argues against the use of dominance theory in working with aggressive dogs.\nWhat We Will Learn\nI read this study not to learn about the interactions of a group of Dutch dogs who live thousands of miles from my home, but to glean insight into the ways my own dogs interact. The bad news is that this study isn’t going to give us the final answer on how dog social hierarchies operate. The good news is that it gives us a solid new tool to use to learn more.\nThis particular study group was very young, consisting entirely of dogs two years of age or less. Companion dogs come in a somewhat wider variety of ages, and this may well affect how they interact with each other. While the characteristic full-body tail wag of a puppy was a common behavior in this group, the preferred low-status markers may have been different if a group of adult dogs had been observed instead. The whole structure of the hierarchy could have differed as well.\nCompanion dogs also come with, let’s say, a bit of breed variety, including the ever-unpredictable mixed-breed dog. The study group comprised only medium- and large-sized dogs, of which about half were Beagles. A group of fun-loving Labradors might not have had such strict rank hierarchy; a group of rule-obsessed German Shepherds might have had an even stricter one. And very small dogs might have interacted in completely different ways.\nThe dogs who live in our homes often (but not always!) congregate in smaller groups than the study’s 10-dog crew. And because they live in our homes, not in kennels, they usually interact with one another much more often than a single hour daily. Compared to their interactions as extended family groups in the wild, wolves show more formal hierarchies when they live in captive environments in which they cannot choose their pack members. We don’t know how the kennel environment changes canine social interactions.\nThe dominance theory of dog training depends heavily on the hypothesis that dogs consider humans to be part of their social hierarchy. This hypothesis remains to be investigated. In some species, males and females occupy two completely separate hierarchies. Similarly, dogs may see humans as living in their own separate rank order, or they may see us as part of their societies. We won’t know until we research further.\nThe Utrecht study offers us some insight: The protocol it defines can and should be used again: on dogs in larger groups and smaller groups, older dogs, dogs of different breeds, groups of just males or just females. We should refine the protocol to find its weaknesses and expand on its strengths. We should design new protocols that let us ask if canine and human rank hierarchies overlap. We should start asking what it’s like to live in dog society. We should ask not just to further discredit dominance theory, but also to build a deeper understanding of the animals whose lives are coupled so closely with our own. There is so much more to know about the dogs we live with, and we are just beginning to learn.",

    "title": "Should Shelter Dogs Be Subjected to Behavioral Tests?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/dog-temperament-tests"
  },
  "page_content": "It’s a difficult situation: Shelters need to avoid putting an aggressive dog up for adoption, but how can they predict a dog’s true behavior? Nine and a half times out of 10, they have no information about how the dog acts in a home environment — or in any other environment, for that matter. Too often, overworked and under-trained staff are left to make a decision after interacting with a dog for less than an hour. A mistake in one direction can mean that a new pet parent is bitten. A mistake in the other can mean a good dog doesn’t go home, or worse, is needlessly euthanized.\nIn an effort to improve these odds, many shelters use behavioral assessment protocols, or tests that place a dog in a series of situations that are meant to simulate challenges they might encounter in a home — for example, pinching their flank to mimic harassment by a child, introducing a person in a funny hat to test their tolerance for a wide range of human appearances, or exposing them to another dog to gauge aggression.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nBut are these tests reliable? So far, research shows they are not. One study on the accuracy of dog behavior assessment tests found that the Assess-a-Pet dog temperament test incorrectly classified 41 percent of nonaggressive dogs as aggressive, and SAFER did even worse. “These are pretty chilling results. They could be interpreted to mean that the two most widely used behavioral assessments in the United States are not doing even a passable job of predicting aggression, and that shelters are not doing much more than flipping a coin when they use an assessment to decide whether a dog will be put on the adoption floor or, potentially, euthanized,” says Jessica Hekman DVM.\nBehavior correction, Mary Poppins style: Turn a job into a game.\nAccording to the ASPCA, “behavior assessments have not proven highly accurate or precise when used to predict aggression after adoption. It has been suggested that a significant number of dogs exhibiting aggression on an assessment do not do so in a home. For these reasons, the ASPCA maintains that euthanasia decisions should not be based solely on a dog’s behavior during an assessment or in any other single situation unless the aggression is egregious.”\nBehavior testing an animal in a shelter setting is fraught with problems. Even the most modern of shelters can be a stressful place for many dogs, as Dr. Sara Bennett, a vet behaviorist, detailed to The New York Times: “Dogs thrive on routine and social interaction. The transition to a shelter can be traumatizing, with its cacophony of howls and barking, smells and isolating steel cages. A dog afflicted with kennel stress can swiftly deteriorate: spinning; pacing; jumping like a pogo stick; drooling; and showing a loss of appetite. They may charge barriers, appearing aggressive.”\nMore and more studies, such as the one co-authored by Dr. Gary Patronek and Janis Bradley of theNational Canine Research Council, suggest that shelters should instead devote limited resources to “spend time maximizing opportunities to interact with dogs in normal and enjoyable ways that mirror what they are expected to do once adopted (e.g., walking, socializing with people, playgroups with other dogs, games, training).”\n“The tests are artificial and contrived,” notes Dr. Patronek, who publishedan analysisconcluding that the tests have no more positive predictive value for aggression than a coin toss. Plus in many of the overcrowded shelters, the assessments are left up to staff members, who aren’t well trained, and who certainly aren’t behaviorists, to make the final say. “Interpreting dogs, with theirdiverse dialects and complex body language— wiggling butts, lip-licking, semaphoric ears and tails — often becomes subjective.” AsDr. Hekmannoted, she had “observed a behavioral assessment in which a dog was repeatedly harassed with a fake hand because the shelter staff had a suspicion that he would bite. As the tester continued to provoke him long after this sub-test would normally have ended, the dog froze, then growled, then finally bit the hand, but not hard enough to damage it. Despite his restraint in the face of persistent harassment, he was labeled as aggressive by the shelter staff and was euthanized.”\nIf your dog’s tail is wagging“to the left, to the left,”asBeyoncésays, it could mean they’re anxious.\nOne of the tests that is most disputed is the food test.Research has shownthat shelter dogs who guard their food bowls, do not necessarily do so at home. And evenEmily Weiss, the ASPCA researcher whose SAFER behavior assessment is one of the best-known, has stepped away from food-bowl tests, saying that research showed that programs that omit them “do not experience an increase in bites in the shelter or in adoptive homes.” Another study showed a stunning revelation: of 96 dogs who had tested positive for food aggression in the shelter, only six displayed it in their new homes. This raised more interesting questions: Is it possible that dogs are showing food aggression in the shelter due to stress? Is food aggression testing completely useless?\nTests that try to assess dog-on-dog aggression using a “fake” dog also have been shown to be less than ideal. One study showed that shelter dogs respond more aggressively to fake dogs than to real ones.\nThe good news is that the ASPCA is reporting that annual adoption rates are on the rise, euthanasia rates are down, and more and more shelters are employing more humane and effective methods, such as programs like Aimee Sadler’sDogs Playing for Lifethat matches dogs for playgroups. As Natalie DiGiacomo, shelter director of the HSUS has noted: “There is a reform movement underway to improve the quality of life for animals in shelters, and playgroups are pivotal to this effort. Play enriches dogs’ lives and reduces stress so their true personalities show.”\nThe bottom line? It’s a complex situation but it’s important to heed the findings from Dr. Patronek: “Nothing in the prevalence estimates we reviewed suggest that overall, dogs who come to spend time in a shelter (and are not screened out based on history or behavior at intake or shortly thereafter) are dramatically more or less inclined toward problematic warning or biting behavior than are pet dogs in general.” You can help by getting the word out to your local shelters about the unreliability of behavior testing — you’d be surprised by how many still employ them.",

  "page_content": "My 12-year-old Bulgarian Shepherd, Gus, has never been very interested in play. He struggles to play with other dogs and is not interested in fetch, tug or chase with me. He loves long walks and going to the dog park, but now that he’s older and has arthritis, my vet has directed me to keep our walks and visits to the dog park (disappointingly) short. Gus has been very restless. How do I get my quirky boy to play with me and work off some of this energy?\nYour instincts are spot on when you suggest that he may be seeking more activity. Many dogs exhibit restless behavior when they’re looking for things to do, but more exercise isn’t the only answer to this dilemma.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThere are a lot of ways to keep a dog active and busy other than play, long walks or going to the dog park. The goal is to keep his mind engaged so he doesn’t become bored. Given Gus’s lack of interest in play and the physical limitations imposed by your vet because of his arthritis, now is the perfect time to explore some new ways to keep him busy.\nBring out the food puzzles.\nOne of the easiest ways to give your dog some mental stimulation is to feed him via food puzzles rather than putting his meal in a bowl. Dogs usually enjoy working for their food as long as they have success at it. In other words, don’t make it so hard that Gus can’t get his food—just hard enough that it’s a fun challenge.\nAll kinds of options exist for feeding dogs in a way that engages their brains. You can stuff Kongs and even freeze them to make them last longer, put kibble or treats in asnuffle mat, or use afood puzzle toydesigned to release treats as the dog pushes or tosses the toy around. You can use wooden, rubber or plastic toys, but do supervise, especially when presenting him with a new toy, to make sure he is using it safely. If Gus can handle ice cubes without harm to his teeth or risk of choking, freeze treats in ice cubes and offer them to him.\nOr, try placing bits of food in separate compartments of something like an egg carton or a muffin tin. Make sure each compartment has its own little puzzle, such as a piece of food wrapped in a paper towel, a similarly-sized piece of fabric or inside toilet-paper rolls folded over on the ends. And again, watch to make sure Gus doesn’t eat anything that’s not meant to be ingested. Don’t use any non-edible items he is likely to eat. You can wrap treats in lettuce leaves or other vegetables if he can eat those. Some dogs treat vegetables like puzzles and work to get the treats inside and others just swallow the whole thing.\nSpice Girlsreference aside, just because your dog is graying around the eyes doesn’t mean those eyes don’t light up at playtime.\nMake a treasure trail.\nMake Gus a scent trail by dragging something smelly along the floor, or scatter pieces of kibble with treats mixed in. The trail itself is fun for dogs, but you can also have the trail lead Gus to a discovery, such as something to chew on, a new toy or a larger pile of treats.\nDo training for fun.\nTraining has a purpose—to teach your dog—but just because it has practical benefits doesn’t mean that it can’t be fun, too. In fact, even though dogs need to learn leash manners and various cues (such assit, down, stay, leave it, wait, come and so forth), I primarily think of training as a great way to spend quality time together. The advantages of training go way beyond the skills your dog actually learns.\nDone properly—using positive reinforcement and allowing the dog to consistently succeed—training’s benefits are endless. Opportunities to be right, to figure things out, to try new things and to get a lot of mental exercise are so good for dogs. Many dogs lovelearning tricksin addition to more general skills, in part because owners are generally more relaxed when working on tricks; tricks also allow dogs to show off to other people and get attention for performing them.\nTraining enables people and dogs to interact and to “win” together. Practical, fun and great for the relationship? That’s what training offers, and it doesn’t get any better than that.\nGames around the house.\nA couple of games you can play in the house are often appealing even to dogs who are not super-easy to engage in play in the classic ways (chase, tug, fetch). One is called “Find Your Treat.” To play, ask your dog to stay while you hide treats in another room (if his stay isn’t solid, put him behind a closed door). Then, release him to search for the treats. When he gets good at the game, you can hide the treats in tricky spots and keep him occupied for quite some time.\nAnother search game is “Hide-and-Seek,” which starts in a similar way, asking your dog to stay in a specific spot. Then,youhide, release him from his stay and call him to come. Reinforce him with treats and attention when he discovers you.\nChew toys are a good pick.\nGiving dogsthings to chew onis a great way to keep them happily occupied for a long time. Whether or not Gus has a history of chewing for fun, I’d explore this option. Some dogs don’t get into recreational chewing until they’ve been offered a smorgasbord of options—the only way to tell if he really has no interest or if you just haven’t discovered a chew toy that appeals to him.\nBully sticks, Nylabones, Greenies, cow hooves, Himalayan yak chews and antlers are possibilities. There are a lot of opinions about which chew toys are safe for dogs, with rawhide being almost universally rejected and real bones igniting controversy. Check with your vet to determine what’s safe for Gus.\nVeterinary behaviorist Dr. Valli Parthasarathy reccos the most durable dog toys for destructive players.\nMassage your pup.\nYour undivided attention is the most likely way to occupy Gus and make him the happiest. In these pandemic times, many dogs are struggling with having us home so much but working (i.e., not giving them all of our attention). Scheduling breaks during the day during which we truly focus on our dogs without distractions helps tame their restlessness and be better able to settle down and chill as we work.\nA petting ormassage sessionis a perfect way to attend to our dogs, especially older dogs, who may be more likely to have some stiff or sore spots. The physical contact and emotional connection generated by this type of activity can benefit both of you.\nReframe the issue you are having with Gus. Think of him as a dog who needs more activities in his life rather than a dog who needs more exercise or play in his life. You certainly don’t have to do everything. Pick a few something that appeals to you, or experiment to see what captures Gus’s interest and helps dial back his restlessness and tendency to disturb you while you’re working.",

    "title": "Why Do Dogs Chase Trucks?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/why-do-dogs-bark-at-trucks"
  },
  "page_content": "Some may think that a dog’s natural nemesis is the cat. Incorrect. A dog’s number one enemy is the garbage truck. Even dogs who are chill with cars and pick-ups lose it when a garbage truck goes by — it’s even more offensive when the thing stops to collect the trash in front of their house! Why are dog’s freaking out over this particular vehicle, and what can we do about it?\nNot every dog who sees a hulking, noisy garbage truck will react to them, but many do. If they’re confronted by one while they’re outside, they might even try to chase it, or bark their heads off from the yard. Seeing it while they’re inside the house may set off an attack of frenzied yelping at the window. This can be annoying, but it’s more the danger of the situation that concerns pet parents Here’s what you can do to protect your dog from fighting against an indefeatable foe.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhat is it about garbage trucks that upsets dogs?\nPretty much everything. They’re big, they’re loud in a whole bunch of different ways, and they stop and start frequently. Heaven only knows how dogs feel about the variety of smells that emanate from them, but there’s certainly a powerful olfactory component. On top of everything — in towns and cities, at least — they pull up right in front of the dog’s house.\nWhen dogs areafraidof something, they naturally want to increase the distance between themselves and that something. If a dog runs away and hides, they’re obviously afraid and want to get as far as possible from the source of the fear. Runningtowardsomething that scares them may seem counterintuitive. Why not runawayfrom it?\nWell-trained dogs have more freedom (and more fun).\nWhen a dog takes an “I’ll get you before you get me” kind of approach —lunging, charging, and barking — their goal is to increase the distance by making theother thinggo away. Dogs learn that the truck retreats when they chase it or bark at it, so it’s a behavior they continue to engage in because it’s reinforced every time the truck moves on.\nIf your dog is in thereactivegroup and you want to change the behavior, there are ways to help them dial it back. In order to do that, however, you need to figure out the cause: Is it set off by a desire to chase, or is it fear-based? Some of these techniques are helpful no matter what is behind the behavior.\nIf a dog is reacting to the garbage truck for the fun of chasing something, then that desire to run and chase can be part of the solution. Since the sight of the vehicle provokes the behavior, one way to turn the behavior around is toliterallyturn it around:Get your dog to runin the other direction by chasing you or, perhaps, a toy. The more fun this alternative chase is for your dog, the easier it will be to train them to turn away from the truck.\nProximity matters. Start by teaching your dog to chase you (or a toy) when there’s no garbage truck in sight. You can do this outside as well as in your house, either by holding the toy and running with it or tossing it. Don’t throw it too far, and if you’re on a sidewalk rather than in a fenced yard, keep your dog on leash for safety’s sake. Repeatedly practicing this strategy will build the foundation necessary to teach them to turn away from the truck.\nOnce your dog is reliably chasing you or the toy, encourage them to do so when the garbage truck is in the vicinity. As with all training, it’s wise to start with situations that are as easy as possible for your dog. Generally, that means when the truck is far away. For some dogs, it’s not reasonable to expect them to chase you or a toy instead of the truck unless the truck’s at least two blocks away. Only try it with the truck closer when they’re really good at doing it at whatever distance they can already handle; decrease the distance by just a little bit each time — perhaps the length of a single house.\nIf the behavior stems from fear, you can change your dog’s emotional response by teaching them to associate the truck with treats. To be successful with this classical counterconditioning technique, details matter. Specifically, it is important that the truck is far enough away from your dog that they are not upset by it. Once they learn to associate the garbage truck at that distance with treats, you can start to give them treats when the truck is a little bit closer, but still far enough away that they’re not scared.\nTo help them learn not to be afraid of the garbage truck, they must have many experiences with seeing and hearing it, during which they’re not afraid and get treats. That means you’ll need to very, very gradually decrease the distance between them and the truck during training sessions — a process that can take weeks or even months — and always give them treats and make sure they’re comfortable. If they react fearfully, you are too close; remove them from the situation as soon as you can, and try again at a greater distance.\nWhen teaching your dog to move away from the window or door where they can see the truck, start when the truck is at the maximum distance at which they can see or hear it. Having them move away as soon as they detect the truck’s presence will enhance your efforts to teach them to turn away even when the truck rolls up right outside. Until they can do that, it’s advisable to put them in another room where they can’t see the truck with a stuffed toy or something else they enjoy while the truck is passing directly by.\nA basic dog-training strategy that can help with this issue is to teach them to perform an incompatible behavior. If your dog is sitting down, running after a tennis ball or looking at you in anticipation of receiving a toy, they can’t simultaneously chase the truck. To use this training method, decide what you want your dog to do instead.\nThe top five reasons dogs bark—and how to get them to relax a bit.\n“Anything else would be fine!” isn’t a suitable option, by the way. You need to choose what you would specifically like them to do, then teach them to do it in the problematic context.\nFor example, teach your dog that if they turn away from the window when they see or hear the garbage truck, they will get something that is valuable to them. Be ready with a toy such as a hollow rubberKongstuffed with top-quality,smelly treats. These types of toys keep dogs occupied longer — in this case, until the truck has passed. Even a generous handful of loose treats will only last a few seconds, after which the dog will head right back to the window to bark.\nAs soon as you hear the garbage truck, put the stuffed toy by your dog’s nose, say, “This way,” and lure them to a place where they can no longer see out the window. Then, give them the reward so that they are bothreinforcedfor coming away from the window and have something enticing to keep them occupied for a while. Again, be sure to stuff it with really high-quality treats. It will take the smell of something special to outcompete their interest in the garbage truck; so-so treats, dry treats, orkibbleare unlikely to cut it.\nOnce they’re reliably and willingly coming away from the window in response to being lured, start cueing them from a few feet away, encouraging them to turn on their own. With practice, you will be able to have them come away from the window without having to lure them.\nEventually, many dogs will get to the point where they notice the garbage truck, then seek out their people in anticipation of the reward they’ve come to expect in that situation.\nThough it may not sound like a satisfying approach, preventing encounters with garbage trucks by avoiding them when possible is an excellent idea. Every time your dog sees a garbage truck and acts in an undesirable way, they’re practicing and being rewarded for a behavior you don’t want them to perform. That is counterproductive to your goal of teaching them to do something else when around these vehicles.\nThe simple strategy of keeping them on-leash while outside goes a long way toward keeping them out of trouble, as does trying not to cross paths with the garbage truck. Don’t walk in the neighborhood on trash pick-up day, at least not at the time of day when the trucks are roaming the streets.\nIf, through bad luck or bad timing, you can’t avoid the garbage truck on a particular day, have a plan so that one incident doesn’t contribute to making the problem worse. There are a couple of strategies you can employ.\nOne is to get them out of the situation as quickly as possible. By increasing the distance between your dog and the garbage truck, you minimize the damage to their progress. So, move away from it, whether that means heading down a side street; making a U-turn and going the other way; or, when inside, moving away from the street-facing side of your home.\nAnother is to block the truck from your dog’s sight, which may mean pulling down the shades in your house or walking behind a parked vehicle on the street. They’ll still hear the truck, but blocking the visual cues can be helpful.\nHowever you choose to address it, don’t make your dog’s issue with garbage trucks worse by using harsh reprimands or punishment. It goes without saying that we should not punish our dogs. Punishment damages the relationship you have with your dog and it is counterproductive, especially when fear is involved.\nWith a plan that includes prevention as well as training, you can help your dog handle the monster that we humans refer to as the garbage truck.",

  "page_content": "Sure, dogs bark and yelp — and make all sorts of adorable sounds, too (like theruffsyou hear when they’re asleep and clearly dreaming about playing with other pups). But a howl? That usually makes pet parents wonder: What’s going on? Are they scared or unhappy? And if it sounds particularly troublesome, how do we get them to stop?\nDog howling is a long, mournful sound very different from short, explosivebarks and yelpsor the high-pitchednasal whine. Howls are one of the hardest dog vocalizations to interpret, largely because there are many answers to the question, “Why does my dog howl?” The first thing to do is attempt to figure out the cause.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhy Do Dogs Howl?\nWhen dogs howl it serves as an alert. Dogs may howl to let you know that there is something they want you to notice. It could be a visitor, another sound, a lost toy, or anything else that has their attention. They may be excited, frightened, or frustrated by the situation (it’s tough to tell at first!).\nFor the record, some of this tendency has a genetic basis. Beagles are among the dog breeds that are likely to howl, as are scent hounds of many types, who are well known for both howling and baying. Huskies are famous for their song-like howls. Humans, however, are split on whether the sound is miserable or a joy to hear.\nMedical problems should always be explored as a possibility when a dog is howling, as physical pain can cause a dog to vocalize this way. Many dogs withseparation anxietywill howl when left alone, conveying their deep emotional distress. Sometimes, the negative emotions — for example, boredom or annoyance — are less serious but still obviously unpleasant for the dog, resulting in the howling.\nSirens, crying babies, and singing can all trigger howling in dogs, though perhaps the most contagious sound is the howling of another dog (or wolf or coyote — really, any canid will do). Experts speculate that whether the sound is another dog howl or just similar enough in some way to get them going, dogs are joining thechorus. Some dogs even howl at the tune of specific songs.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nAnd of course, giving attention in response to the howl is likely to make the howls more frequent.\nHow to Stop Dog Howling\nDogs rarely outgrow howling, but those who do it frequently can be trained to do so much less often, and to cease the behavior when asked. With careful observation of the circumstances that precede the dog howling, you may be able to figure out what is triggering it. That will give you a good opportunity to short-circuit the trigger and prevent the howling.\nI recommend identifying and addressing the root causes and working on interrupting the behavior when it does happen. After interrupting your dog, encourage them to stop by redirecting them to another activity, such as chewing, playing, or training. Train them to stop to a cue such as “Enough” by giving them a treat, toy, or chew toy when they stop howling after being asked to do so.\nIf you’re one of those humans who doesn’t mind the howling, however, let them go for it (as long as they’re not in any distress). And as long as it doesn’t make your neighbors want to howl atyou.",

    "title": "Is “Muzzle Grabbing” a Proper Canine Greeting?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/muzzle-grabbing"
  },
  "page_content": "How do you greet your dog? A scratch on the back or under the chin? What about grabbing and “shaking” a dog’s open mouth? Is that normal or downright bizarre? When the video of presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg greeting a dog was first brought to my attention, I was surprised by how many people defended it as a demonstration of a perfectly normal way to greet a dog. Let me settle this debate: muzzle grabbing is not a kind way to interact with a dog and is not appropriate.\nThere are differences between play and greetings\nIt’s true that many dogs do playfully use theirmouths to interactwith one another, and you do sometimes see dogs mouthing at each other and engaged in a sort of muzzle sparring. The thing is, though, dogs don’t act this way when they are greeting, especially if they are strangers to one another. Using their mouths to interact is unusual unless they know each other well, and even then, it typically occurs during play, not duringgreetings.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nPlay behaviorin dogs includes many types of interactions that would be considered inappropriate and could even be risky in any other context. For example, when playing, dogs will often growl, mouth at each other, pounce on one another, and bat at each other with their paws. All of these behaviors can be perfectly appropriate in play, but not one of them is a normal part of a greeting between dogs, especially if the greeting is with a dog they don’t know.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nHere’s a simple analogy: It’s common for parents playing with their children to say, “I’m going to get you!” Between parent and child, it’s appropriate and it’s understood that the phrase is all in good fun. But, for an adult to say, “I’m going to get you!” to a child they are greeting for the first time would be inappropriate, strange, and unlikely to be well received. Shaking the muzzle of an unknown dog with your hand is not only bizarre and socially unacceptable but possibly dangerous.\nAvoid snout grabbing, greet dogs the right way.\nMany dogs will likely find muzzle grabbing objectionable, and a few of those are likely to react poorly bybiting. But why risk it? A dog who seems to be stable and agreeable might show subtlesigns of stress, like tongue flicks, yawning, and furrowing of the brow. Even though a dog might not react by biting, they still likely find it unpleasant, uncomfortable, or awkward.\nIf you’re looking to make a good impression with people and their pups, steer clear of muzzle shaking, grabbing, andhead patting. If you want to greet a dog, ask permission first and find out how their pet likes to be greeted. You’re far better off offering a dog a treat (with their person’s permission) or simply saying hello to them. For those looking for the short answer, it’s simple: don’t put your hand in a dog’s mouth and then shake them by the muzzle.",

    "title": "13 Common Dog Behavior Myths Overheard at Dog Parks",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/common-dog-behavior-myths"
  },
  "page_content": "Here’s a confession: Eavesdropping is a source of great joy for me. Usually, I just take in what I hear, but it’s a different story at the dog park. Some of the comments I’ve overheard about dog behavior makes me cringe. Here are some common dog behavior myths I’ve heard at dog parks, as well as some truths.\n“The dog park is not for every dog.”\nTrue, the dog park isn’t for every dog. Dog parks can be absolutely wonderful experiences for many dogs, allowing them to play, run off-leash, and sniff in open spaces. However, there are also plenty of dogs who experience the dog park not as a playground but as a gladiator pit.Lots of dogs are overwhelmedin the presence of groups of dogs, or they’re terrified of people they don’t know. Still, others are aggressive and may bite other dogs or people. You shouldn’t assume that a dog-park visit will be a positive thing for all dogs.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n“So many problems can be avoided by moving rather than standing still.”\nI agree, and so does every dog behaviorist and dog trainer I know. Many dogs feel relaxed when they’re on the move but tense up when other dogs and people gather in groups. When everyone stands around, tension can build, which can lead to angst, scuffles, and even fights. Just walking takes the pressure off. Many dogs who might have gotten into trouble will do fine if people keep walking, especially away from the ramped-up energy around the park’s entrance gate. Do everyone a favor by strolling rather than standing.\n“It’s only appropriate play if all the dogs are having fun.”\nIt’s true. Play is really hard to define as a scientific concept. It’s also hard to differentiate appropriate play from inappropriate play, by which I mean play that may lead to aggression or to one or more participants being overwhelmed. Why is this so?\nPlay contains elements of other behaviors, such as predation, fighting, and courtship. In play, these elements are modified and repurposed, but that can make it a real challenge to accurately interpret them in a consistent way. Is itfighting or play fighting? Is it pretend predatory behavior, or is it about to get real? One of the best ways to assess play is to observe each dog. Do they seem happy? Do they seem to be having a good time? If you separate them, do they want to go back?\nTwo animal behavior experts agree it’s usuallyplay fighting. Here’s how you can tell.\nThe bottom line: Though play is hard to define and sometimes a challenge to assess, if a dog is not having a good time, the play should not be considered acceptable.\n“It’s a good sign when dogs pause while playing.”\nYep, this is true. Whether it’s rough-and-tumble wrestling, pouncing, or chasing, healthy dog play has a rhythmic cadence: happy play alternated with pauses. The pauses need not be long — even half a second will do — but they should occur frequently.\nDogs do different things during these brief pauses. Sometimes they just stop whatever it is they’re doing and separate from each other. Some dogs will look around, others will lie down, and still, others will offer play bows. Pauses allow each dog to decide whether to continue playing or switch to sniffing the grass, chasing squirrels, or playing with another dog.\nWhen dogs are playing appropriately with one another and including lots of brief pauses in their fun, they’re exhibiting emotional control. If they have the emotional control to execute frequent pauses, they most likely have the emotional control to prevent the play session from escalating into an out-of-control brawl or aggression, both of which have the potential to result in serious injury. When play between two dogs has no pauses, trouble is much more likely to happen.\n“It’s great to see those dogs switching who’s chasing whom.”\nPlay is a reciprocal endeavor that requires cooperation; everyone involved should be a willing participant. Switching chaser/chasee roles checks both those boxes. Reciprocity is present when both dogs get to engage in both roles.\nCooperation is necessary for the change to happen; if either dog wants to stop, they are free to do so. You’ll sometimes see a dog who will chase but refuses to be chased — if the other dog tries, the one refusing either stops moving altogether or charges the dog who tries to run at them. If a dog is only being chased, it’s hard to know if they are trying to run away or enjoying the game, but a chaser can always stop if they choose to.\n“Let’s not assume being alpha has anything to do with that behavior.”\nDecades ago, almost every behavior problem was assumed to be about a dog wanting to dominate either people or other dogs. Thankfully, the field has come a long way since then, and we now know that it’s wise to stop blaming undesirable canine behavior on dominance hierarchies or a dog’s desire to be alpha. That was never very accurate or very helpful to our dogs. In fact, assuming that dogs were trying to dominate others resulted in antagonistic behavior toward dogs. That outlook made so many behavioral issues worse and damaged many relationships.\nOffering fewer treats can actually be agoodthing.\n“Reinforcement drives behavior.”\nMany dog trainers consider this to be the fundamental truth about our work. It is absolutely true thatpositive reinforcementstrongly influences the way that dogs (and members of other species, too) act. Any reinforced behavior is strengthened and becomes more likely to occur in the future — essentially, the definition of positive reinforcement. While practical applications of this are plentiful, there are many complexities, such as the natural tendency of dogs to perform, or not perform, certain behaviors because the reinforcer is internal rather than external (that is, controlled by us). However, at its simplest, it’s pretty straightforward: Reinforce the behavior you like and don’t reinforce the behavior you don’t like. How you respond to your dog’s behavior today is fundamental to the behavior you’ll see in the future.\n“That dog is growling; they must be aggressive.”\nThis is a myth. Though many aggressive dogs growl, and a growl should always be taken seriously and evaluated,plenty of non-aggressive dogs growl, too, and it can be tricky to tell the difference.\nSome dogs growl to let another dog or a person know they don’t like what’s happening. That doesn’t mean they intend to harm anyone. It just means they are communicating. In some cases, a growling dog may be trying to defuse aggression by telling an actually aggressive dog to knock it off. More commonly, at the dog park especially, growling is a part of the perfectly appropriate play — the canine equivalent of joking around in an “I’m-going-to-get-you” kind of way. Growling is very common in play and has nothing to do with aggression in that context.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\n“Dogs have to be close to the same size to be good play buddies.”\nBeing compatible matters when it comes to play buddies, and so does safety, which is why many people seem to think that only dogs who match in size should be playing together. However, dogs can be compatible and play safely even if they are very different in size.Compatibilityis about enjoying being together and engaging in play that works for both.\nSimilar levels of arousal or speed can make dogs compatible, and that’s about more than size. It’s true that being wildly mismatched in terms of size may present a safety issue for the smaller dog, but that depends on the individual dog. Many big dogs play beautifully with their little buddies by rolling onto their backs, lying down, or being gentle in their movements. Although I recommend watchfulness if one dog is much bigger than the other, extreme size difference is not a dealbreaker for good play.\n“All dogs of that breed play the same way, so they can only play with other dogs of their breed.”\nThis is false. Whether the preferred game is chase, wrestling, or boxing, the best buddies often have the same play style, and different play styles can be problematic. If one dog only wants to wrestle and the other only wants to play chase, the results can be much like two children when one is trying to play checkers while the other is trying to play tag.\nThough there areplay-style-related breed tendencies, none of them are unique to a single breed, and most dogs play in more than one way. There is no such thing as a breed with a single play style that all members of the breed adhere to. No matter what play style a dog engages in, many other dogs play the same way, and those dogs are sure to be members of a variety of different breeds and mixed breeds, too. Play sessions need not be segregated by breed.\n“They’ll work it out.”\nOf all the erroneous statements I hear at dog parks, this one causes me the most distress. That’s because it can easily lead to physical or emotional injuries to dogs. When dogs are intense, awkward, aggressive, or potentiallyaggressivein social interactions with each other, it’s wise for people to defuse the situation. That can be done by calling the dogs, moving away from them to get them to disengage from each other and follow you, or talking in a calm and happy way to change the mood. In some other cases, the dogs may need to be physically separated and kept apart. There is no reason to leave dogs to fend for themselves in stressful situations.\nIf the issue is no big deal, calming everyone down and getting them to move away from each other does no harm. If the situation is more serious, it is essential to take steps to prevent an escalation into serious trouble. The idea that dogs should “work it out” implies that they will negotiate and compromise to some kind of agreement or that one dog will defer to the other, and the one offered deference will back off. We cannot count on dogs to do either of these things, but they need to be able to count on us to step in and help them out so that no one’s hurt or scared.\n“My dog has a high prey drive and that’s why they keep chasing your dog. Don’t worry about it.”\nIf a dog’s relentless chasing has to do withprey drive, it definitelyissomething to worry about. Dogs who chase other dogs as they would chase prey might hurt them. When dogs are playfully chasing one another, they regard each other as social partners,notas prey.\nIs the term “prey drive” correct terminology or jargon?\nAnd just because someone says the reason for their dog’s wild chasing is high prey drive doesn’t mean it’s true. Their dog might be a bully or simply have poor social skills. “Prey drive” is such a controversial term that it’s hard to say whether that’s what’s going on. Still, I regard any dog relentlessly chasing another dog with single-minded intensity as cause for concern. As I mentioned earlier, switching roles in chase games is preferable.\nNo matter the reason that one dog persistently chases another, it can be a cause for concern if the one being chased seems to be attempting to get away. If the dog being chased is having a great time and even encourages the other dog to chase her, that’s an indication that the chasing is playful and probably okay. However, suppose the dog doing the chasing is doing so because of high prey drive. In that case, that’s not a reason to relax and quit worrying but rather a reason to interrupt that activity and find other activities for both dogs.\n“It’s important to bring puppies to the dog park for socialization, especially when they’re very young.”\nNope, this isn’t true. Done right,socializationexposes your dog to lots of objects, experiences, people, dogs, cats, other social partners, and sights and sounds. It’s easy to teach dogs to accept new things throughout their lives if they have many and various positive experiences early on.\nFor puppies, a little exposure goes a long way. Puppies are very impressionable, which is great. However, the downside is that negative experiences at a young age can have serious consequences. Bad experiences can be damaging to puppies, and it is far too easy for them to have a bad experience at a dog park, where they can be aggressively barked at, bitten, rolled, slammed into, or held down. Many puppies are even overwhelmed by large groups of dogs running over to them at once. Taking a puppy to a dog park risks teaching that puppy that other dogs are scary, which is the opposite of proper socialization.\nThat doesn’t mean avoiding all dogs, however. It’s critical for properpuppy social developmentthat they interact with other dogs of various ages, sizes, and breeds, but it’s wise to choose those dogs carefully, so your dog has positive experiences. The dog park doesn’t allow you to choose which dogs interact with your puppy and is not the right place for socialization.",

    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/dogs-sense-magnetic-fields"
  },
  "page_content": "Do dogs sense direction with their vision, smell, or something else entirely? Multiple studies provide evidence that a different mechanism may allow dogs to return to their starting point: magnetoreception, or the ability to sense the Earth’s magnetic field and use it as a compass. This incredible ability is almost as unbelievable as the powers of Haley Joel Osment’s character inThe Sixth Sense. But it’s true. Dogs actually sync up with the Earth’s magnetic field to orient their sense of direction. Here’s how:\nDogs Are Tuning Into Magnetic Fields\nIn one study, researchers reviewed how sensitive dogs are to minor variations of the Earth’s magnetic field and demonstrated that dogs can sense and respond to magnetic fields. Researchers found a measurable change in the dogs’ behavior based on the conditions of the magnetic field.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nSpecifically, they found that dogs choose to pee andpoopunder certain conditions with their bodies aligned along the north-south axis and avoided orientation along the east-west axis. They studied 70 dogs from 37 different breeds over a two-year period, observing 1893 defecations and 5582 urinations. Observations were all made while the dogs were off-leash and in open fields so that they were not influenced by walls, fences, fire hydrants, or other objects.\nThere’s no time like the present, according to your pet.\nThe researchers collected data on dog directionality and found that the way dogs face is not just a matter of chance. They ruled out such factors astimeof day, angle of the sun, and wind conditions. Their analysis found that the Earth’s magnetic field explained dogs’ orientation when doing their business.\nInterestingly, the pattern only emerged when the magnetic field was stable, which was only about 30 percent of the time. The Earth’s magnetic field can become unstable due to such factors as the variation in solar winds and the sun’s magnetic field. During such periods of instability, dogs did not show a preference for aligning themselves along the north-south axis and were oriented randomly.\nDogs Do Have an Internal Compass\nPrevious studies have found that cattle, deer, and foxes sometimes align their bodies with respect to the magnetic field. Sensitivity to the Earth’s magnetic field has previously been demonstrated in species that migrate, such as birds and whales, and also in honey bees, whose navigational abilities are legendary.\nOf course, people have long asserted that dogs can find their way exceptionally well. It was, in part, dogs’ remarkable homing abilities that made the researchers suspect that dogs might be sensitive to the Earth’s magnetic field in the first place.\nSo, the revelation that dogs are able to sense the Earth’s magnetic field and that their behavior is influenced by it is outstanding. It has been known for a long time that dog senses, particularly the sense of smell, mean that they are responsive to stimuli that we humans aren’t aware of, but the fact that dogs can act, in some manner, as though they have an internal compass is just as fascinating.\nAnother publishedstudymay explain how dogs are able to sense the magnetic field. Researchers found that dog eyes contain cryptochrome 1, a light-sensitive molecule that reacts to the magnetic field when simultaneously stimulated by light.\nThis molecule plays a role in the navigational abilities of birds, allowing them to sense the magnetic field through the activation of the visual system. (Birds also detect the magnetic field through cellular-level ferrous particles, called magnetite, as do mole rats, who live underground.) In mammals, cryptochrome 1 has been found in only two of the 18 orders of mammals — carnivores (including canines but excluding felines) and primates (including orangutans).\nDogs’ Sense of Direction\nAnother piece of research reveals a way that being able to sense the Earth’s magnetic field influences dogs’ behavior. In this study, the researchers chose to focus on hunting dogs because they are generally considered to have amazing homing abilities. They outfitted 27 hunting dogs of 10 breeds with GPS trackers and collected data from a total of 622 daylight excursions in 62 locations. The dogs’ trips lasted 30 to 90 minutes and were undertaken in forested areas away from buildings, power lines, and roads. The paths they took out and back were the subject of the study.\nMany dogs followed their ownscentback to the starting point using a method called “tracking,” which was observed in 399 returns. But in 233 excursions, dogs returned to the starting point via a novel route called “scouting.” In 50 cases, dogs combined both strategies in a single return route.\nResearch finds that your pup can smell when you’ve been doom-scrolling, and they get bummed out.\nA majority of the dogs who returned by scouting began with a short run (about 20 meters/65 feet) along the Earth’s north-south axis; they did this no matter what direction they needed to go in order to return to the starting point. The researchers hypothesized that the dogs perform this initial “compass run” to get their bearings.\nThough scouting dogs’ routes were far more likely to begin along a north-south axis, for tracking dogs, the direction of the start of the return route was random. Another difference was that the scouting dogs returned to their pet parents faster than the tracking dogs.Genderand breed did not influence the likelihood of employing scouting versus a tracking strategy, nor did wind or sun.\nActivity along the north-south alignment of the compass axis is observed in many animals. Such behavior allows animals to access a universal reference frame that is so useful for navigation. Despite dogs showing some of the same abilities and mechanisms as migrating birds, marine mammals, and sea turtles, there is still so much more to explore about a dog’s sense of direction. What we do know so far is that they have their own internal compasses, just as people have been saying for ages.",

    "title": "Your Dog’s Personality Can Change Over Time",

  },
  "page_content": "When you spend extra time scratching your dog’s belly, or taking your dog out for long walks and games of fetch, or even when you feel constant frustration over their chewing habits, you are gradually shaping your pup’s personality. Dogs, like people, have moods and personality traits that shape how they react in certain situations. Adog’s personalityplays a big part in their life: researchers found that a dog’s personality will influence how close they feel to their pet parents, their biting behavior, and even chronic illness.But, their personality is not a constant; it will change as they grow. Here’s what you might expect from your pup’s personality changes.\nHow much does a puppy’s personality change?\nResearchers from Michigan State University (MSU)foundthat puppy personalities change quite a bit as they leaveadolescence. “When humans go through big changes in life, their personality traits can change. We found that this also happens with dogs — and to a surprisingly large degree,” says lead author William Chopik, professor of psychology at MSU.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\n“We expected the dogs’ personalities to be fairly stable because they don’t have wild lifestyle changes humans do, but they actually change a lot. We uncovered similarities to their owners, the optimal time for training, and even a time in their lives that they can get more aggressive toward other animals.”\nResearchers surveyed pet parents of more than 1,600 dogs, including 50 different breeds. Dogs ranged from just a few weeks old to 15 years and split closely between male and female. The extensive survey had pet parents evaluate their dog’s personalities and answered questions about the dog’s behavioral history. Pet parents were also asked to answer a survey about their own personalities.\n“We found correlations in three main areas:age and personality, in human-to-dog personality similarities, and in the influence a dog’s personality has on the quality of its relationship with its owner,” says Chopik.\n“Older dogs are much harder to train; we found that the ‘sweet spot’ for teaching a dog obedience is around the age of six, when it outgrows its excitable puppy stage but before [they’re] too set in [their] ways.”\nYep, research says your dog is as special and perfect as you tell them they are.\nHow do pet parents influence their dog’s personality?\nOne trait that rarely changes with age in dogs isfearand anxiety. Homing in on the saying, “dogs resemble their owners,” researchers showed dogs and pet parents share specific personality traits. Extroverted humans rated their dogs as more excitable and active, while pet parents high innegative emotionsrated their dogs as more fearful, active, and less responsive to training. Pet parents who rated themselves as agreeable rated their dogs as less fearful and less aggressive to people and animals.\nThe pet parents who felt happiest about their relationships with their dogs reported active and excitable dogs, as well as dogs who were most responsive to training. Aggression and anxiety didn’t matter as much in having a happy relationship, says Chopik.\n“There are a lot of things we can do with dogs — like obedience classes and training — that we can’t do with people,” he says. “Exposure to obedience classes was associated with more positive personality traits across the dog’s lifespan. This gives us exciting opportunities to examine why personality changes in all sorts of animals.”\nThese findings prove how much power humans have over influencing their dog’s personalities. Chopik explains that many of the reasons a dog’s personality changes result from the “nature versus nurture” theory associated with humans’ personalities. “Say you adopt a dog from a shelter. Some traits are likely tied to biology and resistant to change, but you then put it in a new environment where it’s loved, walked, and entertained often. The dog then might become a little more relaxed and sociable,” says Chopik. “Now that we know dogs’ personalities can change, next we want to make a strong connection to understand why dogs act — and change — the way they do.”\nSource:Michigan State UniversityContent may be edited for style and length.Original StudyDOI: 10.1016/j.jrp.2019.01.005",

  "page_content": "From humping to “targeted” sniffing, dogs have a plethora of odd habits — at least to those of us who walk on two legs instead of four. Until dogs learn to speak human, divulging their best-kept secrets, we’ll just have to continue to make educated guesses about these weird but common dog behaviors.\nWhile most of these behaviors are harmless, the key is recognizing if a behavior signals poor health. If you notice any behavior that might be concerning, please contact your veterinarian right away. Here are seven seemingly weird dog behaviors explained.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nRolling in garbage\nWhen you see a dead animal or a pile of garbage, your first inclination is probably to step around it … waaaaay around it. But, with dogs, it is their greatest desire to jump right in, getting a good coating of ick with a strategic roll. The more foul the smell, the stronger the lure, and the more joy that is experienced by the now perfumed pups. It’s thought that dogs like to cover their own scent with horrible odors to make it easier to surprise prey. You probably can’t curb your dog of this desire, so your best hope is to spot smelly things first and steer your pal in a different direction.\nA “sniffari” gives your dog a chance to be the boss.\nTail-chasing\nWhen puppies chase their tails, it’s like babies grabbing their toes — and this is a normal way for them to explore their bodies. But like anything in life, moderation is key, and problems can arise if this tail-chasing behavior becomes compulsive. So, how do you determine if your pup has a case of canine-compulsive disorder? It comes down to whether you can distract them from this behavior. If your dog would rather chase their tail than go for a walk, they may have a compulsive disorder, and a veterinary assessment may be needed.\nA fascination with lights and shadows is common in high-energy dogs — but it can develop into obsessive-compulsive disorder if it gets out of hand.\nScooting\nIt can be common for dogs to drag their bottoms across the ground after doing their business, particularly if their stool is loose. But if this behavior is noted frequently throughout the day, this may bea sign of impacted anal glands, a condition that can have serious complications if left untreated.\nDog trainer Emma Bowdrey helps explain this common canine behavior.\nHumping\nWatching your dog get personal with their stuffed toy can make you want to look away, but it’s not abnormal. Many dogs discover thathumpingfeels good, it can relieve stress or serve as an outlet for excessive feelings of exuberance and excitement. Both males and females are known to partake in this behavior, though males do it more often.\nNo less than 7 animal behaviorists weigh in on what’s behindall of this bumping and grinding.\nEating grass\nPeople often think thatdogs eat grasswhen their stomachs are upset or they are ill. However, a good ol’ lawn actually serves as a gourmet snack for many dogs. As omnivores, they like to eat their meat and veggies, too. Eating grass in moderation is a normal part of a dog diet, and a walk in the park for my dogs always includes a stop at the grass buffet. That said, if all of a sudden you see your dog frantically binging on grass, this could be a sign of distress, and a call to your veterinarian is in order.\nYour pup is literally vegging out—when it’s no big deal and when to worry.\nCrotch-sniffing\nIt is general custom for dogs togreet each otherwith a sniff of the behind, but why share this custom with us? Bad manners? Well, not according to the canine code of conduct, as this is a perfectly acceptable way of collecting personal information about one another, including humans. So the next timeyou are surprised by a nosey nudge, just know that you are being greeted and assessed (and don’t worry, dogs generally won’t be offended if you just give them a pat on the head in turn).\nIs it time to teach your dog some boundaries?\nEating poop\nGross, right!? I’m asked about this all of the time and all I can do is give an empathetic cringe of the nose and a shrug of the shoulders. (I know the score: My dog Mickey used to raid the cat’s litter box, proudly returning with “kitty cigars.”) As stomach-turning as this is, eating excrement is a surprisinglynormal behavior for dogs. In the early stages of domestication, dogs performed a hygienic function of cleaning up their own feces. Additionally, their digestive system is very efficient, and they can actually get some quality nutrients out of it — although I can think of much better sources.\nWhat to do when your dog has questionable tastes.\nHopefully, this has shed some light on a few odd dog behaviors. I find myself looking over at my own dog, Bauer, wondering if he is looking back at me, thinking, “Wow, there she goes again, sitting in front of that computer when she could be outside playing with her ball.Now, that’s just weird.”",

  },
  "page_content": "Whether you live in an urban, suburban, or rural area, coyotes can be a threat to your pet. Coyotes live all over North America, and their population continues to thrive. You may have heard of coyotes preying on house cats, but what about dogs? Should you be concerned that a coyote will attack your pup?\nMost coyotes are fearful of people and generally make an effort to avoid us. They react very differently to dogs, however, taking quite an interest in them. Coyotes may view dogs as a threat, or as potential prey, depending mainly on the size of the dog.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nDogs and coyotes are close relatives, but how they behave around each other has not been well studied. In the past, it was difficult to observe interactions between dogs and coyotes, but social media has changed that. Recently, researchers interested in the nature of dog-coyote interactionsused YouTube videos to explore how these two canids behave around one another. Here's what they found.\nHow Dogs and Coyotes Interact\nThe researchers in the study evaluated 35 clips of free ranging coyotes and dogs in spontaneous, unplanned interactions. There were 4 videos that captured coyotes behaving in a predatory way towards dogs, 11 videos that showed dogs and coyotes participating in social play, and 9 videos of the two species in agonistic interactions, which relates to fighting but is much broader than aggression because it also includes threats, retreats, displays, conciliatory behavior, and appeasement. Videos that did not show any of these categories of behavior were classified as other/undetermined.\nThe researchers found that members of both species directed playful behavior to members of the other species, leading to play bouts. The play behavior between the two species generally involved chasing behavior with reversals being common. Play bows were performed frequently in the play, sometimes by the dog, sometimes by the coyote, and in some cases, by both species during a play bout.\nThere were also videos in which dogs bit coyotes and one in which a coyote bit a dog. Additionally, in 3 videos, coyotes attacked and shook small dogs, all of whom escaped. In one case, the coyote dropped the dog and ran away when a larger dog ran towards and lunged at the coyote. There were no instances of dogs behaving in a predatory way toward coyotes.\nThe videos with behavior that was not classified included several instances of potential predatory interest in dogs by coyotes. In those videos, coyotes were watching small dogs from a distance but without engaging in any actual stalking or other hunting behavior. One video showed potential sexual interest by a coyote in a dog. The male coyote followed a female dog slowly and within 5 meters, stopping multiple times to sniff the ground and to urinate.\nGet your fix of Kinship\nWe promise not to send you garbage that turns your inbox into a litter box.

In the videos evaluated for this study, dogs were classified as small, medium, or large. Dogs were larger than the coyotes in all but one agonistic interaction. Only one small dog had a playful interaction with a coyote, and coyotes only engaged in predatory shaking behavior with small dogs.\nThe materials for this study — opportunistically acquired videos that people were motivated to post — do have a sampling bias. With the exception of a few surveillance videos, they were taken when people were with their pets, generally during the day and mainly in well-populated areas.\nEven with those concerns, the valuable takeaway from this study is that there are a number of ways in which dogs and coyotes interact. Future studies could be even more comprehensive if people are encouraged to film and submit footage of these species interacting together. But remember: Coyotes are dangerous, wild animals, so do not encourage your dog to interact with them. It's simply not safe.\nAvoiding Confrontations with Coyotes\nThe best way to avoid trouble with a coyote is to avoid coyotes, sounds simple right? That isn’t always easy to do but here are a few tips:\nStay away from areas known to have a lot of coyotes.\nStay away from areas known to have a lot of coyotes.\nStick to open trails and paths and stay away from areas with thick vegetation.\nStick to open trails and paths and stay away from areas with thick vegetation.\nWalk your dog on a leash.\nWalk your dog on a leash.\nDon’t walk in coyote-prone areas around sunrise or sunset.\nDon’t walk in coyote-prone areas around sunrise or sunset.\nIf you do see a coyote, do not run away. Be assertive and attempt to scare the coyote away. In the spring it is possible that coyote pups are around, in that case, walk away rather than try to scare the coyote. Your dog will probably bark and make it tough but, do not turn your back on the coyote, always back up.",

  "page_content": "There is plenty of evidence that continued activity and social engagement with physical and/ormental exercisehelp maintain cognitive function in aging dogs. But, for many dogs, getting grey hairs might mean their people play with them a little less and do less training and walking either because of injury or under the misguided notion that old dogs just want to rest.\nStudies show that people experiencing age-related mild cognitive impairment may improve their cognitive function with a memory game on an iPad. With that in mind, can the same be said for dogs? Find out how touchscreens might help provide opportunities forcognitive enrichment in old dogs.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nKeeping Old Dogs Mentally Fit with Tech\nOne study explored the possibility that there are benefits of using touchscreen technology to help dogs stay happy and mentally sharp as they age. Researchers used touchscreens to offer dogs the opportunity to play games in which correct choices resulted in food rewards. Since dogs (and other animals that have been studied) find food even more rewarding if they have earned it rather than offered it for free, the idea has great potential to improve dogs’ quality of life and well-being.\nThe study, published along with other work on computer-animal interactions, also proposed that the system has the potential to improve the welfare of dogs — especiallysenior ones— through cognitive enrichment. Here’s how it worked:\nDogs in the study first had to be trained to touch the screen for a treat, then to touch it in a certain place, and finally to choose between options in order to be correct. Once that base level of training was accomplished, dogs could be introduced to more challenging cognitive tests.\nSpice Girlsreference aside, just because your dog is graying around the eyes doesn’t mean those eyes don’t light up at playtime.\nThe study was performed with 265 dogs (and 20 wolves) who were taught to use the touchscreens and demonstrated the potential of touchscreen games and puzzles to positively impact dogs of all ages, especiallyolder dogs.Pet parents of the dogs in the study reported that their dogs became increasingly happy with each visit to the lab for training sessions and that the whole experience led to benefits in their everyday lives.\nMental Exercise is Good Exercise\nMany of the dog’s pet parents in the study were surprised at how tired their dogs were after their cognitive training sessions and began to buy into the importance ofmental exercise. The unintended result of this was that many of them invested time and effort into additional forms of cognitive work with their dogs. The additional enrichment was good for the dogs’ quality of life. Many pet parents became more engaged with their dogs and proud of their accomplishments, which improved thebondbetween people and their dogs. (This may be an effect of involvement in any sort of study and may not indicate that touchscreens, in particular, as a tool, lead to improved relationships.)\nThe study suggests that future work should explore the effects of touchscreens on dogs in specific ways: levels of cortisol (as a measure ofstress) and dopamine (as a measure of motivation), the effects on thedog-human relationship, changes in learning ability and problem solving, and the emotional effects on dogs.\nPotential Downsides to Dog Gamers\nThe researchers hope that their studies could lead to the development of commercial tablet games for dogs. The idea that touchscreens may help improve aging dogs’ cognitive function and well-being is intriguing, but there are concerns.\nOne issue is that people may rely on these tablets to occupy their dogs rather than interact with them directly.\nOne issue is that people may rely on these tablets to occupy their dogs rather than interact with them directly.\nMuch like with humans, another problem may be that dogs could suffer the negative aspects of gaming — lack of exercise, addiction, and social isolation — especially if they are not used in moderation as the designers intended.\nMuch like with humans, another problem may be that dogs could suffer the negative aspects of gaming — lack of exercise, addiction, and social isolation — especially if they are not used in moderation as the designers intended.\nWhat do you think about touchscreen games for dogs?",

  "page_content": "Dogs come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, from Mastiffs and Great Danes to Chihuahuas and teacup Poodles, and are all part of the sameCanis lupus familiarisspecies. But how did so many different breeds come to be, and just how closely related are they? Geneticists Heidi Parker andElaine Ostrander, along with a team of colleagues from the National Human Genome Research Institute, set forth tofigure that out.\nHow the oldest dog breeds evolved.\nThe scientists’ interest was in the origin of the breeds, not the origins of canine domestication. Their aim was to build a family breed tree and to understand what makes some breeds more susceptible than others to certain diseases.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThey worked from a sample size that included 1,346 dogs representing 161 breeds, or not quite half of all those known to exist. By comparing the differences at 150,000 spots on each dog’s genome, they built a family tree. This is still very much a work in progress, as there are at least 350 breeds of dogs.\nAlmost all the breeds fell into 23 groupings, called clades, and this amazing cladogram shows how the various breeds are related, not just genetically but also by common traits. For instance, hounds like Beagles, Afghans and Salukis are in one clade, and dogs bred for strength—Boxers, Bulldogs and even Boston Terriers for example—are in another.\nOne of the most popular breeds in the world is also one of the least genetically diverse, causing huge implications for the breed.\nConnections between common dog traits.\nBesides sorting breeds into clades, the study also provided estimated dates that cross-breeding occurred, and distinguished breeds geographically. Even dogs bred for a specific purpose, like herding, can show considerable diversity based on geography and time periods. As Parker noted, “This shows herding is not a recent thing. People were using dogs as workers thousands of years ago.”\nDifferent herding dogs use very different strategies to bring their flocks to heel, so in some ways, the phylogenetic data confirmed what many dog experts had previously suspected, the researchers noted. \"What that also tells us is that herding dogs were developed not from a singular founder but in several different places and probably different times,\" says Ostrander.In contrast, Pointers and gun dogs and Spaniels share very tight genetic groupings and display little genetic variation, and their origins can be traced to Victorian England.\nIn another really interesting finding, the research points out how some breeds were used to create other breeds, and the extent to which DNA and the mutations it may carry can be shared across multiple clades. The Pug is great example; it was used to shrink the size of other breeds as early as the 1500s. As Parker noted, “Pug DNA is part of many other toy and small dog genomes.”\nHow this information helps dogs.\nUnderstanding dogs' genetic backstory also has practical applications. Our canine compatriots fall victim to many of the same diseases that humans do--including epilepsy, diabetes, kidney disease, and cancer--but disease prevalence varies widely and predictably between breeds, while it is more difficult to compartmentalize at-risk human populations. \"Using all this data, you can follow the migration of disease alleles and predict where they are likely to pop up next, and that's just so empowering for our field because a dog is such a great model for many human diseases,\" says Ostrander. \"Every time there's a disease gene found in dogs, it turns out to be important in people, too.\"\nThis information is important to mixed-breed dogs because knowing the breeds involved, and the clades those breeds belong to, can help infinding potential genetic health problems.  One of the best examples is in diagnosing a disease such as collie eye anomaly (CEA). While CEA can appear in collie-type dogs (in the herding clade), it can also occur in Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers. This analysis shows that this Canadian sporting breed dog has either Collie or Shetland Shepherd ancestors who may have passed on the defective gene.\nAs Robert Wayne, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, not involved with the study, observed, “Mixing has resulted in the sharing of specific genomic regions harboring mutations which cause disease in very different breeds.”",

    "title": "Why Do Dogs Pee on Other Dogs (and Leashes) During Walks?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/peeing-on-other-dogs-during-walks"
  },
  "page_content": "Taking multiple male dogs out for a walk can be like taking your own little watering can out for a spin — a splash on the light post, a few drops for the fire hydrant, a dribble over an old pile of poop, a good soaking of the neighbor’s prize roses. Dogs aim their urine for marking purposes, so they’re able to direct the stream somewhat accurately.\nUrine markingin dogs is a well-known behavior in the sense that everyone is aware that it happens, but it is poorly known in the scientific sense because so few studies have examined it with a rigorous approach.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nYou’ve Got (Pee)Mail\nCountermarking behavior in dogs (what they do during walks) consists of either marking on (overmarking) or near (adjacent marking) previous scent marks. From our perspective, one patch of grass or tree is pretty much like the next. Astudyon the effects of sex and social status found that what we think we know about marking behavior from observing it casually, even over years and years, may not be as spot on (so to speak) as we think.\nComparing marking betweendog friendsand unfamiliar dogs, here’s what researchers found:\nIntact males were more likely to overmark urine from intact females.\nIntact males were more likely to overmark urine from intact females.\nMales who overmarked had a higher tail base position (which the authors used as a measure of social status) than males who did not overmark.\nMales who overmarked had a higher tail base position (which the authors used as a measure of social status) than males who did not overmark.\nFamiliarity with a dog did not affect overmarking, but dogs adjacent marked only urine samples from unfamiliar dogs.\nFamiliarity with a dog did not affect overmarking, but dogs adjacent marked only urine samples from unfamiliar dogs.\nNeither sex nor tail base position affected adjacent marking.\nNeither sex nor tail base position affected adjacent marking.\nBeing spayed or neutered had no relationship with the likelihood of countermarking.\nBeing spayed or neutered had no relationship with the likelihood of countermarking.\nIn observations of countermarking at a dog park, they found that:\nMales and femalesboth countermarked and investigated urine.\nMales and femalesboth countermarked and investigated urine.\nMales and females with higher tail base positions did more urinating, countermarking, and urine investigation than members of the same sex with lower tail base positions.\nMales and females with higher tail base positions did more urinating, countermarking, and urine investigation than members of the same sex with lower tail base positions.\nPeeing and Marking During Walks\nSo, dogs are typically able to put their urine where they want it to go, but have you ever seen a dog purposelyavoidspraying something? I’ve never seen a dog try to ensure that any objects stay dry as they share their liquid calling cards with the neighborhood. But, there are times when I wish that dogs would try to avoid dousing things with their pee.\nMany dogs do this, circling twice, three, four, or more times in the same spot beforepeeing. They’ll often end up tangled in the leash or standing over it, leaving the leash in the perfect spot to get caught in a urine stream.\nCelebrity dog trainerVictoria Stilwell on how to keep your dog from using your living room as a toilet.\nAlso at risk of being hit by pee is any other dog in the vicinity, especially if both are on a leash, guaranteeing they are near one another. Since dogs out on walks together so often sniff the ground together — and make little effort to get away from one another — I suppose it’s inevitable that someone gets peed on. As one is stillsniffing, the other one decides to mark that exact spot — paying no attention to the fact that their buddy’s head is in the way. Sigh.\nWhile many dogs might not even notice, some dogs object to being peed on. My buddies Saylor and Marley illustrate this. Marley is a big-time marker, and Saylor loves to follow him. As a result, he has occasionally inadvertently marked her head, neck, or back. Yuck. But Saylor now leaps out of the way to avoid Marley’s pee, often jumping swiftly in whatever direction is required. Saylor now recognizes the behavioral signs of an impending pee and has learned to steer clear —as soon as he starts to lift his leg, she is out of there.\nPrevention\nFew people have avoided this little drawback when they’re pet parents of a dog. It’s not just males that pee on dogs and on leashes. As evidenced by the study, females can do it too. While it may be less likely for dogs who squat to pee than for dogs who lift their leg, it is by no means just a male issue.\nIf you find your pup is peeing on their pals, there are a few things you should do. If this is a sudden change in behavior or you’re concerned for their health, take a trip to the vet to make sure there isn’t a health-related issue. Second, you can attempt to redirect your dog’s poor aim by teaching them topee and poop on cue. Or there’s always Saylor’s route: train your other dog to get out of the way!",

    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/do-dogs-understand-pointing"
  },
  "page_content": "If you’ve spent any time with dogs, you aren’t surprised when a dog stops to check out the ground. It also shouldn’t surprise you that a dog might go where you point. Pointing is about social communication, and it often feels like dogs are right there with us, sometimes even more than members of our own species.\nIn the last 20 years, dogs’ attention to our communicative gestures — particularly this thing we do with our arm and finger — has attracted enormous attention from researchers around the globe. In fact, the pointing gesture is so fundamental that seemingly no article on the canine mind is complete without a sentence such as “dogs read our gestures, like pointing, more flexibly than any other animal” (New York Times), or — more boldly inTime— “While chimps and even wolves lack an innate ability to understand what pointing means, dogs come by the knowledge naturally.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThese statements tend to produce any number of reactions in pet parents, from “Obviously,” sometimes accompanied with a side of, “Why do they bother to do this research anyway?” to the flip side: “My dog doesn’t do that … what are they talking about?” Or even the more nihilistic view: “Sure they do, but who cares?”\nHere’s why we care: this one little gesture, in all its complexity, could be a core feature of the intimate bond we share with dogs. Find out why dogs understand pointing and the research to back it up.\nWhat is pointing all about?\nResearchers have tried to uncover why and how dogs pick up on ourcues. Initially, key questions focused on whether their ability to follow the pointing gesture arose from our long-standing co-evolutionary history or, alternatively, if they learned the behavior over the course of their individual lives.\nPointing is something we humans do as part of our social communication, and it is useful only because we all agree on how it should be interpreted. Imagine if your point were perceived as, “Hey! Check out my fingertip. No dirt under my nail. Wonderful, huh?” Not exactly useful for communication. Fortunately, we understand that pointing creates a shared experience beyond our fingertips; pointing draws someone’s attention past our outstretched index finger to something out there in the world.\nThis cooperative gesture serves us well. Yelling, “Look out!” is only somewhat informative, but yelling, “Look out!” and pointing can help a fellow human locate and respond to a Frisbee sailing in at head level or Godzilla rampaging down Fifth Avenue. Communication achieved.\nIs your dog the ultimate smarty pants?\nDespite our mothers’ reminders that pointing is rude, it has a function: it reflects our ability to hold shared attention with others, which could also indicate that someone else is aware of the same thing that we are. Pretty meta. Joint attention can thus be associated with an ability to infer others’ mental states, which is considered an important social capability in humans.\nAt about six months, children start following the gaze and gestures of others. We start pointing around our first birthday and become increasingly point-savvy as we age. When toddlers see something of interest and point at it, they become excited when we also look. They will also point when seeking something or to provide information (I want that. You dropped something). Regardless of how it’s used or understood at any given age or moment, pointing intrinsically aids our communication with one another.\nDo dogs get the point?\nIt shouldn’t come as a surprise that much of the academic interest in thecanine mindthat blossomed in the late 1990s was actually largely about us, investigating to what extent dogs responded toourcommunicative gestures —  notably, our pointing. In research labs around the world, it has been a pointing party ever since.\nWatch any program covering research into the canine mind and you’re bound to hear mention of studies involving a dog, two cups and a pointing human. The experiment, commonly referred to as the object-choice task, follows some variation of this procedure: a dog first learns he can get a treat for approaching either of two identical cups. He then watches as a person points to one of the cups. Will the dog follow the point to the cup?\nHuman children are quite good at this task, and numerous studies confirm that dogs are, too. From an early age, dogs are highly responsive to this gesture. Dogs do well when a person points with a foot, or bows or nods. They’ll also respond to what’s commonly referred to as a “momentary” point, in which the person points and then lowers their arm before the dog makes a choice. They will follow the point even when a person stands by one cup and points at the other. Although we all knowsmellis a major player in the canine world, it doesn’t appear to factor greatly into dog performance; when food is hidden under one cup and nobody points, they don’t do so well. Some researchers describe their performance as “remarkable” and “outstandingly flexible.”\nA bee that flies into your car will never be aided by your outstretched arm pointing toward the open window. Given dogs’long historywith us, researchers wondered whether canine sensitivity arose through the domestication process — in which case, wolves, their closest relative, might be less adept in this task — or, on the other hand, whether it’s a product of learning and dogs’ individual life experiences. Or maybe the reality is not so black-and-white. What underlies their highly flexible ability?\nSay What? A look at the types of words that dogs understand.\nWolves do not follow our gestures as flexibly as dogs. Nor do chimpanzees, our closest relatives. This isn’t to say that wolves (or chimpanzees) can’t or don’t do it. Extensively socialized wolves and enculturated chimps — those highly familiarized with human behavior —  can follow our points, but dogs generally respond more readily and easily, and wolves need more exposure to perform similarly. In 2002, Brian Hare of the Duke Canine Cognition Center pulled together then-current research on dogs, wolves and chimpanzees and, in an article inScience, concluded, “Dogs’ social-communicative skills with humans were acquired during the process of domestication.”\nScience behind dog’s ability to understand pointing.\nMore immediate genetic influences, like artificial selection, could also influence dogs’ skills. Márta Gácsi and colleagues at the Family Dog Project in Budapest found that while all dogs tested followed the point better than chance would predict, dogs bred for cooperative work (like gun dogs) performed better than those bred for independent work (like guard dogs). All the dogs in the study were living as pets and none had received special training, implying that genetics plays a role at some level in enhancing dogs’ ability to follow our gestures.\nAt the same time, individual life experiences could also contribute to a dog’s responsiveness. For example, the reactions of shelter dogs to our pointing gestures vary widely, and a small group of intensively socialized lab-raised dogs did not fare well in the task.\nLucia Lazarowski of the Comparative Cognition Laboratory at Auburn University, one of the investigators in the lab-raised dog study, saw their challenges first-hand. But when she later adopted Captain, a study participant, and informally examined his responsiveness to pointing, she found he performed much better in her home: “He actually looked in the direction I pointed and sniffed in the area I was pointing to. During the test, however, he was one of the more non-responsive dogs. Now, we like to play a game where I toss small treats around the room for him to hunt, and if he can’t find them, sometimes I’ll point to them, so he probably has picked it up from that.” Captain’s transition to canine point-follower highlights that learning and life experiences can factor into the skill.\nIt turns out, dogs know a useless instruction when they hear it.\nThe person behind the point can also affect dog performance. Amy Cook, CDBC, CPDT-KA, conducted a study on the topic at the University of California, Berkeley; reporting inAnimal Cognition, Cook noted that when pet parents and strangers were pitted against one another (in what I hope was described as a “point-off”), dogs tended to follow their people, even when they received no reward (i.e., the point did not lead to the dog getting food). As Cook explains, “Dogs make decisions by attending preferentially to social signals from humans with whom they have become more familiar.” Many of us think it’s all about us, and our dogs might agree.\nIf dogs respond to the pointing gesture based on whose finger is doing the work, then again, it looks like life experiences could be controlling the switches. But not so fast: Cook suggests that this unique spin on the issue —  dogs being more attentive to a familiar person — could have been shaped by evolutionary pressures to bond with a caretaker.Attachmentrelationships between dogs and their humans are well documented and, as Cook says, going with your person could be “a successful strategy in the long term.”\nIsn’t it nice when everyone can be right? Dog responsiveness to our communicative gestures could be a product of their evolutionary history plus their ability to learn rapidly once in a human environment. In a 2009 article inBehavioural Processes, Pamela Reid, CAAB and vice president of the ASPCA’s Anti-Cruelty Behavior Team, reflects on what’s behind canine responsiveness to our social cues: “Dogs are too skilled for it to be pure trial-and-error learning. Yet it is improbable that a versatile behavior like this would be largely innate.”\nDogs have the ability to understand much more complex things than you give them credit for.\nShe suggests that what we see in dogs is an adaptive specialization of learning. “In essence, they come with a built-in head start to learn the significance of people’s gestures, in much the same way that white-crowned sparrows acquire their species-typical song and ducklings imprint on their own kind.” This fits in well with what is understood as instinctual or innate behaviors. As Jack Hailman explained in his influential piece inScientific Americanin 1969, “How an Instinct Is Learned,” species-specific behaviors require some amount of experience and development.\nWhen Patricia McConnell, CAAB, mulled over the pointing research on her blog, “The Other End of the Leash,” she agreed that dogs could be “predisposed to learn to follow a pointing gesture.” McConnell also highlights something you might have seen yourself: present a very young puppy with an outstretched finger and thatpuppyis going to approach your fingertip, not follow it to a distant location. McConnell’s point is that point-following in puppies is not automatic, although they learn it very easily.\nTo this, Reid adds, “Just because a skill appearsearly in developmentdoes not preclude learning. It does, however, demand that puppies be highly attentive to the actions of humans, a tendency that has been confirmed in studies of dog-human attachment.”\nDo dogs understand what pointing means?\nWhat do dogs think of all this? What does it mean to be a dog who “understands” our pointing gesture? A 2013 article by Ádám Miklósi and József Topál of the Family Dog Project inTrends in Cognitive Sciencesconcludes by highlighting that “dog social competence [appears] sometimes ‘infant-like’ or ‘human-like,’ but, importantly, the underlying mental mechanisms may turn out to be quite different.”\nIt’s hard enough for us to figure out if, for example, our boss is merelysuggestingthat we do something ortellingus to do it. The same is true for dogs and the pointing gesture. Do dogs see pointing as an imperative — “You. Go there.” — or as simply providing information or a helpful suggestion — “I recommend that you go there.” — a subtle yet meaningful difference. A 2011 article published inApplied Animal Behaviour Scienceby Helene Pettersson and colleagues found that, like children, dogs are more likely to follow a point when it is accompanied by a cooperative tone of voice as opposed to a prohibitive tone. At the same time, dogs sometimes follow the point to an empty container, leading some to wonder whether, under certain circumstances, dogs might perceive the gesture as a command.\nIt’s a nice thought.\nLike humans, dogs seem to distinguish when communication is — or is not — intended for them, although they could be relying on a more limited set of cues. Numerous studies find that initiating eye contact and using high-pitched vocalizations help dogs understand that the communication is for them. The setting is also important. In a 2011 study reported inPLoS ONE, Linda Scheider and colleagues found that if a person points to a location where a dog has never experienced reinforcement, the dog is not as likely to follow as he would be if he had previously receivedreinforcementthere (making me wonder whether the ring-bearer dog would spontaneously follow the point to the altar).\nAt some level, every pointing gesture suffers from a fundamental ambiguity: we might be pointing to a particularobject, or we might be pointing to a specificspacethat happens to be inhabited by a particular object. Usually, we can figure it out without too much cognitive difficulty. Even nine-month-old infants understand when pointing refers to an object as opposed to the place where the object is located.\nHow about dogs? In a study recently published in theJournal of Comparative Psychologyby Tibor Tauzin and colleagues, an experimenter pointed at one of two different toys on either side of him. Before the dog could approach, the experimenter switched the location of the objects in full view of the dog. The researchers wondered whether the dog would approach the object that had initially been pointed at, but that was now in a new location, or to the original location of the point. The result? Dogs did not follow the object to its new location. Instead, they approached the old location, which seems to imply that, for the dog, pointing could be more about the location than the pointed-at object.\nFor those of us who live orwork with dogs, much of the value of pointing studies lies in what we do with the results. Despite being unflashy, the pointing gesture is actually rich in dimensions and angles that we can explore with our dogs. As Reid recommends, “Take note of your body gestures. Does your dog attend to your gestures in all cases, or only in certain contexts? Dogs are often way more sensitive than we can grasp. They’re not trying to fool you or trick you, get one over on you, or cheat the system. Attending to our gestures is just what dogs do. It’s who they are.”\nCook, A., et al. 2014.My owner right or wrong: the effect of familiarity on the domestic dog’s behavior in a food-choice task.Animal Cognition17: 461–470.\nFranco, F., and G.

  "page_content": "“If your dog doesn’t like someone, you probably shouldn’t either” is a popular expression, reflecting the general view that dogs are good judges of character. But are they? Multiple studies have found that dogs are keenly aware of the behavior of those around them. Baddies beware because dogs don’t like mean people — and even a bribe won’t change their minds.\nCan dogs sense a person’s character?\nYears ago, I had just moved to a small town and was eager to meet other people. When I stopped on the street to talk to my neighbor for the first time, my dog unexpectedly stiffened. Though this man approached my dog gently, my dog backed away and refused to interact at all. It was embarrassing. My dog’s behavior was off-putting and felt like a social setback.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nLater, when I mentioned this interaction to the family who owned the house I was renting, they weren’t surprised. They told me that everyone in town knew he was mean. After warning me to be careful, they shared stories about his history of violence, specifically towards his ex-wife and children, and also towards other people in town. I later learned further unsavory details about him, which was offputting because the man seemed friendly enough during our brief encounter. My dog seems to have had the proper reaction to my neighbor immediately, even though I did not. There have been several studies about how dogs make social and emotional evaluations of people that can provide some insight into how dogs judge a person’s actions. They can evensmell human emotions.\nDespite plenty of reasons to get mad, an animal behaviorist says dogs rarely expressrealanger.\nDogs notice if you’re being unhelpful\nIn one study, scientists evaluated dogs to investigate how they would respond to people after watching them behelpfulor refuse to help other people. In the experiment, the person pretending (for the sake of science) to be in need of help was the dog’s person. The dog watched as their person attempted to open a container while two strangers sat on either side of them.\nIn one scenario, the dog’s parent would turn to one of the people next to them and hold out the container, where they would be assisted by a “helper.” In another instance, the person asked to help would respond by turning away, clearly not giving assistance, leaving the pet parent to continue with the unsuccessful attempts to open the container. In the third group (the control), the pet parent did not solicit help and didn’t interact with either person. The third person in all groups remained neutral, neither helping nor refusing.\nAt the end of each of these role-playing situations, both strangers offered the dog treats. After seeing their person helped, dogs were equally likely to take the treat from either stranger. However, when there was a refusal to help, dogs chose to avoid taking treats from people who were not helpful. Similar results were found in capuchin monkeys, and the same pattern is well known to occur in children.\nAccording to the researchers, this is the first study to show that dogs make social and emotional evaluations of people regardless of what they had to gain. If the pups were acting solely out of self-interest, there would be no differences, meaning an equal number of dogs would have accepted food from each person. It is interesting that the dogs in this study act as though they assume that people are okay and trust them — until they have evidence to the contrary.",

  "page_content": "Check out YouTube and you can find an alarming number of videos of dogs chasing the light from a laser pointer, often while people laugh in the background. While it might seem fun, that laser pointer chasing can lead to serious behavioral issues — Laser Pointer Syndrome in Dogs — a real concern for pet parents. Here’s everything you need to know about how laser pointers can impact your dog’s mental health.\nAre laser pointers really that bad for dogs?\nYep, if you watch your dog’s body language when chasing the laser, you’ll quickly see that laser pointers are bad for dogs. Using a laser pointer isn’t amusing for your dog — that frantic pouncing on the dot can often be seriously unpleasant and filled with tension for pups. The movement of the light stimulates dogs to chase, but there is nothing to catch, and that is why the game is bad for dogs. Constant chasing without ever being successful at catching the moving object can frustrate dogs, leading to obsessive and destructive behaviors.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nFrom another perspective, workingscent detection dogstrained to find things like explosives, drugs or diseases have similar experiences and can become upset when they don’t make regular “finds.” These dogs need regular successful finds to stimulate their training, but they may not experience them during the course of their regular in-field work. That’s why it is standard practice to set up simulated missions in which working dogs are guaranteed to discover what they have been taught to find. Successful searches keep their skills sharp and prevent psychological problems.\nA fascination with lights and shadows is common in high-energy dogs — but it can develop into obsessive-compulsive disorder if it gets out of hand.\nA lot of dogs become obsessive about the light from laser pointers, and there are many cases of dogs who were diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder after (and perhaps partly as a result of) this activity. Dogs become preoccupied with the light, then transfer that interest to similar stimuli, sometimes developing a behavior problem in which theychase lights and shadows.\nLike with people, there’s the potential for eye damage if the laser accidentally shines directly in your dog’s eyes. Children who are unaware of the risks are more likely to cause harm to your pup’s vision.\nHow to prevent behavior problems with laser pointers.\nNo matter how much dogs respond to them, I recommend against the use of laser pointers with dogs. It’s just too likely that the game will negatively affect the dog.\nBut, one way you can use a laser pointer with your dog while also minimizing the risks of your dog developing behavioral problems and psychological damage is to use the laser as a decoy to help them find treats or a new toy. Though the dog does not ever succeed at catching the light, there is a reward in discovering other items. Using the light alongside treats and toys slightly lowers the risk of trouble but does not eliminate the danger.\nLaser pointer alternatives:\nThere are so many other games to play with your dog that are safe, amusing, and behaviorally healthy.

  "page_content": "There are two types of dogs in the world: dogs who become tangled in their leash and those who don’t. Tangled-up pups seem to have aneasy-goingapproach to life — leash and all — while other dogs will stop in their tracks. Some dogs never learn to untangle themselves when the leash goes under one or more legs, even with efforts to teach them how to do this.\nSafety is the main reason you should care about keeping the leash properly organized. It can be dangerous if the leash wraps completely around a leg, and a leash that is out of place can cause a dog to be off balance.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhy are some dogs unable to untangle themselves?\nObviously,intelligencein the problem-solving area can play a role in which path a dog takes. But it’s far more complex than a simple question of brain power, with other factors being important, too.\nOne big predictor of which dogs learn to extricate themselves when the leash has gone between their legs or wrapped around them is whether it makes them uncomfortable to have the leash there. Some dogs don’t seem to care if the leash is partially wrapped around a leg or if it touches their belly, so a twisted leash does not represent a problem. If it’s not a problem for a dog to have the leash out of place, then there is nothing to be fixed.\nA “sniffari” gives your dog a chance to be the boss.\nSome dogs are too interested in other things to focus on a tangled leash. If they are paying attention to the sights orsmells on a walk, any issues with the leash may not be a top priority. Paying attention to other things may account for the dogs who sometimes choose to step over a leash purposefully and sometimes don’t bother; it depends on how exciting the walk is at the moment. Other dogs are always too intent on the sensory experiences during the walk to fuss over where the leash is.\nStop Leash Tangle\nHere are a few ways to help your dog keep their leash untangled.\nChoose a shorter leash\nChoose a shorter leash\nTeach your pup towalk by your side\nTeach your pup towalk by your side\nDon’t use a retractable leash\nDon’t use a retractable leash\nIf using a front harness clip, also attach it to the collar\nIf using a front harness clip, also attach it to the collar\nTeach your dog to “fix it” by capturing the behavior with treats and praise when they do it themselves.\nTeach your dog to “fix it” by capturing the behavior with treats and praise when they do it themselves.",

  },
  "page_content": "One of the best things about living with dogs is the unbridled joy with which they greet you when you come home — no matter how long you’ve been away. It has long been thought, and oftentimes documented, that dogs have a sixth sense that allows them to “know” your ETA in advance. Just how do they do it?\nIn Alexandra Horowitz’s book,Being a Dog, she offers what seems to be a very reasonable explanation. It isn’t just that they can smell us from afar or hear our footsteps or the car motor. Rather, as she writes, “there was a potent combination of two forces leading to these dogs’ abilities. The first is the distinctness of our smell to our dogs. The second is the ease with which dogs learn our habits.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThere’s no time like the present, according to your pet.\nDogs can basically smell time.\nShe says, “It might be that the odors that we leave around the house when we leavelessenin a consistent amount each day.” Basically, your smarty dog’s amazing nose knows that over the hours you are gone, your home begins tosmell lessof you.\nHorowitz tested this theory by recruiting a colleague to sneak one of her partner’s stinky t-shirts into the house hours after her partner left, once again infusing the house with his odor. And yes, the ruse seemed to work. That day, their dog, who had reliably demonstrated that he knew when his person was nearing home, was found snoring on the couch.\nDogs know based on their experiences.\nDogs are also remarkably quick at associative learning. They’re very good at picking up on subtle cues like reading body language, changes in the environment, and listening to sounds. And not just your own signals, but maybe the sound of a neighbor’s car that starts up a few minutes before you arrive home. Environmental stimuli likelight shifts, sounds, smells, and even cues you can’t pick up on can play a role in your dog’s ability to sense when you’re coming home.",

    "title": "Do Dogs Think About the Past?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/do-dogs-think-about-past"
  },
  "page_content": "For better or worse, remembering the past comes naturally to humans — whether you’re conjuring up what you ate for breakfast or how red you turned that time you called your teacher “mom.” This kind of event recollection is called episodic memory, and humans are pretty good at it. But when it comes to our pups, it can be hard to tell what they remember. So, do dogs think about the past the way we do? On the scale of “goldfish” to “elephant,” how unencumbered by the woes of yesterday are our canine friends?\nHow Much Do Dogs Remember?\nResearchers investigated this question with astudyon the topic of canine memory. In the journalCurrent Biology, the group published a report showing that dogs have episodic memory, too.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThe study found that dogs can recall a person’s complex actions even when they don’t expect to have their memory tested. “The results of our study can be considered as a further step to break down artificially erected barriers between non-human animals and humans,” says Claudia Fugazza of MTA-ELTE Comparative Ethology Research Group in Budapest, Hungary. “Dogs are among the few species that people consider ‘clever,’ and yet we are still surprised whenever a study reveals that dogs and their pet parents may share some mental abilities despite our distant evolutionary relationship.”\nDo Dogs Remember Yesterday?\nIn 2015, Marc Bekoff, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Colorado, reflected on the subject of canine memory when he saw an essay called “Dogs Don’t Remember,” published by Dr. Ira Hyman. He disagreed, saying, “So, all in all, unless others and I are missing something, dogsdoremember yesterday...There are many examples of dogs and other animals‘remembering yesterday.’Think of dogs and other animals who have been severely abused. Think of dogs who remember where they and others peed and pooped, dogs who remember where their friends and foes live, dogs who change their behavior based on what they learned, and dogs who remember where they’re fed and where they’ve cached food and other objects. The list goes on and on.”\nDoes your dog freak out when you head for the door? Here’s some advice.\nStudying Episodic Memory in Dogs\nIn the study led by Fugazza, the researchers took advantage of a training method called “Do as I Do.” Dogs trained to “Do as I Do” can watch a person complete an action and then do the action themselves. For example, if their person jumps in the air and then gives the “Do it!” command, the dog would jump in the air too.\nThe fact that dogs can be trained in this way wasn’t enough toproveepisodic memory alone. That’s because it needed to be shown that dogs remember what they just saw a person do even when they weren’t expecting to be asked or rewarded.\nThe researchers first trained 17 dogs to imitate human actions with the “Do as I Do” training method to get around this problem. Next, they did another round of training in which the researchers trained dogs to lie down after watching the human action, no matter what it was.\nAfter the dogs had learned to lie down reliably, the researchers surprised them by saying, “Do It,” and the dogs did. In other words, the dogs recalled what they’d seen the person do even though they had no particular reason to think they’d need to remember. They showed episodic-like memory.\nYep, research says your dog is as special and perfect as you tell them they are.\nDogs were tested in that way after one minute and after one hour. The results show they were able to recall the demonstrated actions after both short and long time intervals. However, their memory faded somewhat over time.\nThe researchers say that the same approach can most likely be used and adapted in a wide range of animal species to understand better how animals’ minds process their actions and that of others around them.\n“From a broad evolutionary perspective, this implies that episodic-like memory is not unique and did not evolve only in primates but is a more widespread skill in the animal kingdom,” Fugazza says. “We suggest that dogs may provide a good model to study the complexity of episodic-like memory in a natural setting, especially because this species has the evolutionary and developmental advantage to live in human social groups.” For all those pet parents out there: your dogs are paying attention — and they’ll remember.",

    "title": "Are There Differences Between Guide Dog Breeds?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/guide-dog-breeds"
  },
  "page_content": "Does the breed of a service dog make a difference? When so many intelligent, loving shelter dogs are in need of homes, why don’t guide dog schools rescue dogs like some of the other service-dog programs (likeAnimal Farm Foundation)? The answer lies in the nature of the work guide dogs are required to do. Dog jobs, like people jobs, are task-specific and require specific temperaments, some of which can be selected through breeding.\nRead on to hear the real-life experiences of seven blind people who’ve used guide dogs most of their lives. They compare problem-solving strategies between 36 dogs representing six breeds. If you’ve lived with a Lab, Golden, German Shepherd, Aussie, Border Collie, Flat Coat, Poodle or hybrid of these breeds, you’ll probably be pretty fascinated by how each breed handles the job.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhat type of dogs are guide dogs?\nTerry Barrett, director of training operations at Guide Dogs for the Blind (GDB) in San Rafael, Calif., says, “In our earliest days, the 1940s, most of our dogs came from animal shelters. It soon became evident that we were looking for something very specific: Dogs who not only had excellent health, intelligence and temperament but also exhibited a willingness to work and thrived on praise.” By the late 1970s, opportunities for shelter dogs all but disappeared.\nAlthough German Shepherds, Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers are the most familiar types of guide dog, any confident, friendly, intelligent and willing dog —large enough for the harness but small enough to lie comfortably under a bus seat — is eligible. Boxers, Smooth-Coated Collies, Poodles, Dobermans, Border Collies and Australian Shepherds are increasingly finding employment as guide dogs, as are their more genetically sound hybrid offspring.\nLoyal, devoted, and dutiful, Pit Bulls are proving to be pretty well suited to helping humans in need.\nLabs are the most common guide dog breed.\nLabrador Retrievers, who constitute about 60 percent of these working dogs, have proven to be the most successful guide worldwide, mainly because there is enough variation within the breed to meet blind students’ myriad needs. “It’s a 50-50 relationship,” says a handler who’s worked with one Lab, two mixed-breed Labs and two Goldens, and now is partnered with aLabradoodle. “Neither one of us is in total control at any given time. Both of our lives depend on what the other one does. Neither of us may be able to make a safe street crossing alone, but together we do it gracefully.”\nGuide dog schools select for temperament characteristics that are broadly adaptable. A guide dog’s disposition requires them to be easily trainable, friendly, calm under pressure, and confident in their job — in all environments. Regardless of lineage, guide dogs have distinct counterintuitive characteristics in common. Because they are, to a great extent, bred for a specific temperament, they are more like one another than they are like others of their particular breed.\nIs there a best guide dog breed?\nBoth the person and dog work as a team, each contributing to a relationship built on trust that begins during class, then deepens and broadens over time. But some blind handlers argue that there are marked differences in each breed’s approach to guide work, while others think that the traits that make good guides neutralize the larger behaviors that characterize each breed.\nOne blind handler who has worked with a German Shepherd for 10 years, a Lab for seven, two different Golden Retrievers for 15 years, and now has two years experience under his belt working with a Golden-Lab cross says that there are some physical characteristics that are different among breeds, such as the gait and how the dog feels through the harness. “Even so, the dog’s unique personality, combined with the person’s — how they work together and what they expect of each other — that’s where the differences are.”\nAnother woman who has worked with two Shepherd guides and one Lab-Golden cross said, “In my opinion, you might say that the retrievers’ style provides more information about the specifics of the environment, but the Shepherds’ style makes for more efficient travel. My Shepherds, in comparison to my Retriever, both typically looked farther ahead as they guided. They corrected for upcoming obstacles from a distance and our travel path was typically a smooth line. Sudden turns or stops happened only in response to an obstacle that unexpectedly crossed our intended path. My retriever cross clearly does not take the same approach. In general, this dog will stop and show me the obstacle, and he will almost always seek prompting from me on which way to go next.”\nOne woman got her first German Shepherd in 1996 after working with three Labs. She says she had to learn the body language that was unique to the Shepherd. “At first, I thought when my Shepherd would insist on going a certain way and I wanted to go another that she was being stubborn or willful. I soon discovered that if I acknowledged her for what she was showing me, and then asked her to go the direction I wanted to go, she was totally fine with that. My second Shepherd is the same way.”\n“How my dogs dealt with obstacles isn’t, in my opinion, a function of breed-specific differences,” says a seasoned 25-year guide dog user who has partnered with an Airedale, a Border Collie mix, an Australian Shepherd and, briefly, a Siberian Husky. “My Airedale, as I recall him, was quick to generalize about the concept “obstacle” but wasn’t particularly good at scoping out his environment and making decisions in advance.” The Aussie and the Border Collie mix seemed to generalize quickly.\n“The Border Collie mix had very high head carriage and was by far the very best dog I’ve worked when it came to overhead hazards,” he said. “The Aussie has been harder to teach naturally occurring overheads like tree limbs, but whether that’s a breed thing or a result of their tendency to work with their heads a little low, I’m not sure.”\nSay What? A look at the types of words that dogs understand.\nAnother typical difference between dogs, explains a blind handler, is their approach to routes. “Personally, I find that my retrievers enjoyed familiar routes. In comparison, my Shepherd gets bored with routine, so you have to get creative with routes and mix things up,” she says.\nShe adds that retrievers are looking to please the handler, as if asking, “Did I do what you wanted, am I making you happy?” whereas her shepherds have been motivated by doing the job and solving the problems. “With Shepherds, it’s not so much about what pleases me as it is about pleasing themselves,” she says.\nA guide dog handler who has worked with three Labs, a Lab mix, a Golden Retriever and a German Shepherd explained, “If I were to generalize,” she says, “I’d say my Labs often worked up to an obstacle before deciding what to do about it, while my Shepherd would decide in advance what to do, perhaps starting the turn more gradually as we approached the barrier. My Golden would stop to show me before trying to work it out.”\n“My Goldens were much more attuned to my reactions to things. If I did hit a branch, I needed only to flinch and they both acted as if they had been corrected. I would describe my Lab as being solid, but she had the attitude that things would move for her or she would move them. She was careful, generally, but also had no compunction about moving me through some tight gaps. It wasn’t always pretty, but she would get you where you needed to go safely and with enthusiasm.”\n“Working a guide dog is like dancing,” she explains. “And being responsive to my partner’s moves is how it works best for me. I’ve had two very large Labs, both with a lot of initiative. They seldom asked for my input, made quick swift movements and expected I would be able to keep up and go with them. They were more likely to try to interpose their bodies between me and muscle me out of the way or into safety. My Golden and my small Lab were likely to be cautious and refuse to leave the curb until they determined that a car they watched was not going to move toward us.”\nEight guide dogs and 34 years later, a handler contemplated her experiences with four Labs, two Goldens, one Shepherd, and one Flat-coat Retriever. “My Flat Coat solved problems by coming to a full stop. Sometimes he would just stand there, and I could feel his head moving. People said that he looked like he was weighing all the possibilities. Then he would make his decision. And in nine years of partnership, he never made a mistake.”\nRegardless of genealogy, each dog takes a unique approach to problem-solving. “I noticed that the Aussie I’m working with now had a very strong preference for traveling on one or another side of a street when we walked home from work,” explained his handler. “Eventually, I figured out the preference stemmed from whether it was or had recently been raining. One side of the street was commercial, the other had lots of trees with branches that hung low when wet.”\nFind out which dog breed is right for your lifestyle.\nA blind woman who has traveled with guides said, “My assumption is that my dog is acting to keep us safe until he proves to be distracted or is putting his agenda ahead of mine. Sure, if that sudden plunge proves to be because my Lab dove for a French fry, the appropriate correction needs to be made. Extra work to minimize that behavior may be called for, but ‘follow your dog’ has to be the first response if we are going to learn to trust and read each other. My safety depends on my ability to read their reactions and go with it and figure out the ‘whys’ later.”\nOne man described all his dogs as having been keen observers. “They’ve all had similar complex personalities,” he says. “They enjoyed their work and have been more than willing to guide and do things such as squeeze into small spaces and stay for hours, only because I have asked them to.”\nA thirty-year guide dog veteran summed it up. “I’ve owned plenty of dogs as pets, but my relationship with the half dozen guide dogs I’ve worked with was different: All of my guide dogs seemed to own me rather than the other way around.”",

  "page_content": "I’m not a jealous person by nature, but I felt such envy recently when a client told me that both of her (unrelated) young adolescent dogs take two to three-hour naps each afternoon, and at the same time, no less. One of the dogs sleeps so soundly that you could vacuum right outside their crate and not wake them up, though the other is likely to awaken in response to loud noises. This type of long and scheduled nap, in addition to a long nighttime sleep, isn’t that common in older dogs.\nMost adult dogs nap on and off during the day and seemingly relish a little extra rest. Though dogs sleep more than people, they are often more flexible abouthowthat sleep is allocated through the day.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHow long should dogs nap?\nDogs need more sleep than people, and some napping is typical. It’s not unusual for adultdogs to sleep 14 hours a day. Puppies often sleep closer to 18 hours each day, although sometimes all this sleep happens in a lot of little nap sessions rather than a few bigger ones.\nSigns your puppy needs a nap.\nSome of the signs that a puppy needs a nap are obvious—yawning, lying down, struggling to keep their eyes open—but other signals may be more confusing. Sometimes a puppy is all wound up and acting crazy, and it seems that what they need is more activity and stimulation. In fact, what theyreally need is a nap.\nThough it’s counterintuitive, those bursts of loopy behavior can be a sign of fatigue. Many puppies become very mouthy when they are tired, and though this looks like a puppy with extra energy, it’s often a puppy in desperate need of rest.\nToo many naps?\nIf you notice changes in sleep patterns or the need for excessive sleep, it may indicate health issues. Concerns can range from something manageable like requiring higher-quality nutrition to as serious as life-threatening cancer. As always, reach out to your veterinarian with any questions or concerns.",

  "page_content": "Dakota had previously struggled with behavioral issues, but this time, he really went bananas. When the cell phone began to vibrate on the table, he panicked, which is why he jumped through the window, shattering it and scaring a couple of kids riding by on their bikes. Luckily, his person was able to calm him down, and his injuries were minor. Is he a bad dog? No.\nThe situation was just more than he could handle. It would be unfair to call his response “bad,” though it was certainly undesirable. Oh, and Dakota isn’t a dog, technically speaking. He’s a wolf hybrid, and like most animals, reacts strongly to anything new — a sound, a person, an object, or a situation. Their difficulty with novelty is one of the main reasons I don’t recommend people getwolf hybrids as pets. But dogs are different.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nSuper Adaptability\nDogs tend to respond more easily to new things, which is why they make great pets. Their ability to take “new” in stride is part of what makes dogs who they are. Perhaps best of all, they quickly form new social bonds throughout their lives, which is why many people are able to have loving, close relationships withrescue dogs.Most dogs are able — even expected — to face new situations without blinking (and, for that matter, without barking). Think of what is typically asked of dogs. Many are placed with new people in a new home at the age of seven to 10 weeks. Some stay in that home, but others are rehomed, in some cases, multiple times. Even dogs who stay with the same family will face much that is new.They might be taken out in a canoe or spend the night in a kennel while the floors are being refinished; eat a different kind of food; endure a loud party;welcome a new dogor a new baby or a cat to their household; move to a new home, a new town, from the city to a rural area, or vice versa. They may have to stay with adog sitter, greet a new dog walker, accept regular rearranging of the furniture, or change routine when their pet parents start working in an office instead of from home. Even if the household remains steady, dogs generally meet new dogs and new people and go to many new places throughout their lives.\nOne-of-a-Kind\nOf course, things don’t always go smoothly. Many dogs struggle to deal with “newness” of one sort or another. Some dogs freak out when they walkon snowfor the first time or when the baby cries in the middle of the night. Though dogs tend to handle novelty better than most other species — each dog is still an individual.\nTips on helping a dog deal with their daily stress.\nPersonality and experience both contribute to how adog reacts to stress, solves problems, and how stressful they find something new. Some dogs may bark, cower or hide; others will growl or lunge; a few will bite. Some pups seek comfort from their pet parents; they might whine, freeze up or approach tentatively; head for their crate; or retrieve a comforting toy.\nSimilarly, responses to a positive novelty can run the gamut from leaping and spinning, sniffing, grabbing, jumping, whining, barking, or a tail wagging that’s vigorous enough to cause a mini tornado of fur. Behavior has a genetic component; dogs are genetically predisposed to be flexible and adaptable. Yet, genetics do more than account for differences among species. They also explain various behavioral differences among breeds and individuals, including disparities in a dog’s ability to cope with changes in their environment. As in other aspects of canine behavior, this ability also varies. That’s why certain traits such as gregariousness, shyness, curiosity, and fearfulness can actually run in lines of dogs.\nHelping Dogs Adapt\nSo, some dogs come into this world with greater potential for enjoying newness or at least successfully coping with it. Still, full development of this potential requires the right kind of experiences at the right age.\nIn order for dogs to maximize their ability to respond well to the unfamiliar, frequent and positive exposure to a variety of people, places and situations early on is essential. Without those opportunities, they may not be able to manage the unexpected as adults.\nPuppies who encounter grass, cats, concrete, elevators, paper airplanes, toys, kids, blankets, music, oven timers, men and women, stairs, other dogs, people with canes, rugs, bells, hair dryers, fish tanks, mirrors, and a wide variety of other elements of their world are far more likely to develop into adult dogs able to handle them, as well as other novel things, later in life.\nExposure to potential social partners has received particular emphasis from behaviorists and trainers. Socialization is the process of becoming aware of the social world and learning how to behave within it. For dogs, it involves making sure that puppies have positive experiences with other dogs and people at the age during which they are most receptive to being influenced by those exposures.\nEven brief encounters in the first few months of dogs’ lives can have a large impact on their future behavior. Absent these opportunities, no amount of contact later in life can make up for the deficiency. Dogs whose worlds were limited during puppyhood are rarely as comfortable around new things, including potential social partners, as those whose early months were rich in experiences.\nHelp! Should I take my young dog to the dog park for “socialization”?\nRecovering from Trauma\nBecause of these missing opportunities, dogs raised in severely impoverished environments — tied up outside or used as breeding dogs in a puppy mill, or in ahoarding situation, for example — struggle to adjust to what most would consider a “normal” environment once they are liberated. In many cases, the problems they face are less a result of the bad things that happened to them and more about the good things that did not. For these dogs, anything new poses a serious challenge, and it can take them months, if not years, to improve. And in the end, it is unlikely that they will ever be able to deal with novelty as easily as dogs with more generous upbringings.Even well-adjusted, flexible, happy dogs can be shaken by traumatic incidents. These events will affect some dogs more than others, but no dog is immune to the effects of something extremely scary or upsetting.A study of pet dogs who survived the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami and the nuclear disaster that followed them showed that these dogs had issues and behavior consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Compared with a control group of dogs who were not involved in the disaster, these traumatized dogs had a harder time learning new skills in training sessions and greater difficulty connecting with new people (caregivers in their rehabilitation program).Dogs can also be negatively affected by less harrowing but still aversive experiences. They may struggle when meeting new dogs who resemble one who attacked them when they were young, develop a reluctance to go to the park after being caught in a thunderstorm there, or become uncharacteristically terrified of strangers as a result of being home alone during a burglary.\nOn the other hand, many dogs do more than just accept new things in their lives; they sometimes actually prefer them. In one study, dogs were offered three toys — two familiar and one novel — and chose the new toy first in nearly 80 percent of the trials, indicating a preference for the new item over the well-known.\nThe range of situations, objects, and social partners that most dogs take in stride is enormous. It’s something people tend to take for granted. A dog’s ability to roll with whatever situation they find themselves in is really amazing and far from typical in the animal world.",

  "page_content": "How is dog intelligence measured? We know bigger dogs, with larger brains, perform better on executive functioning — like short-term memory and self-control — than their smaller breed counterparts. But a dog’s brain size does not seem to be associated with all types of intelligence, particularly social and emotional reasoning. According to some dog cognition researchers, the average intelligence of a dog equates to that of a toddler (around two years). But there are plenty of ways a dog excels beyond that level of understanding.\nHow intelligent are dogs?\nThe internationally renowned Hungarian scientist Vilmos Csányi studies dog intelligence and behavior at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, where he chairs the department of ethology. In his book,If Dogs Could Talk: Exploring the Canine Mind(translated by Richard E. Quandt), he talks about dog intelligence, the social andemotional bondsbetween dogs and humans, and the idea that, by observing the cognitive behavior of dogs, we can also learn much about how the human mind works.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nRico, the Border Collie, made the news because he could differentiate the names of many different toys. “In my view, the Border Collie represents a very interesting case, suggesting that dogs indeed have the potential for fast ‘word’ learning. Of course, this does not mean that they could acquire language like children, but they might have some skills for recognizing the connection between a novel vocalization (“word”) and the presence of a novel object,” says Csányi.\nOn average, dogs are considered as smart as two-year-old children. Csányi says Rico’s word intelligence resembles that of a 14- to 16-month-old baby. “This is in general agreement with what dogs can achieve in other faculties of mind [relative] to human cognition. This study also hints that in the case of ‘talented’ individuals, with special training or ‘education,’ dogs can show an even higher potential for social cognition than has been appreciated so far.”\nIn onestudy, researchers sought to determine if dogs are similarly smart across multiple tests, like people. When people take IQ tests, they tend to perform at a similar level across various tasks. If they do well in one area, they’ll often do well in others. Researchers created a dog IQ test of sorts to test this theory on dogs with 68 Border Collies. The test included tasks like navigating barriers to get to the food, weighing the differences in quantities of food, and following instructions on the location of food. The results showed that dogs performing well on one test were likelier to succeed on another. Not all the dogs did equally well, so it’s clear that intelligence is based on the individual dog. How much of it isunderstanding language?\nThen there’s Chaser. Chaser learned to differentiate at least 1,022 words — more than any other animal — most of which were related to toys. Throw in some basic grammar, her ability to categorize her toys by function and shape, and the start of imitative behavior, and you have one smart dog.\nChaser spent four to five hours a day working on enriching social and learning experiences. John Pilley and co-researcher Dr. Alliston Reid later published their findings and urged everyone to discover how smart their dogs really are.\nAccording to animal behaviorist Karen London, using a more specific terms like“biddable”or“bombproof” can help you better understand your dog.\nAre dogs emotionally intelligent?\nThere have been suggestions that dogs and humansco-evolved. Is it because dogs also excel in emotional intelligence? Dogs have indeed acquired behavioral traits that have human analogs. “Dogs form an attachment relationship with their owners, and very likely (to some extent) with other members of their group, thatresemblesthe way human children are attached to their mothers,” says Csányi. This emotional connection between dogs and people goes beyond family pets. “We have shown that even adult dogs [living in dog shelters] can very rapidly form attachment to humans [after only approximately 30 minutes of interaction]. The development of attachment between adults is again a human-specific trait,” asserts Csányi.\nGregory Berns, a neuroscientist at Emory University who uses functional MRIs to measure activity in the human brain, had long been a dog-lover, so when his family adopted Callie, a hyperactive Terrier mix, he naturally started to wonder what she might be thinking. This led him to consider how he might apply techniques used in his studies of the human brain to dogs. In the fascinating bookHow Dogs Love Us, he recounts the methods his team employed and how their pet dogs made some groundbreaking studies possible.\nTraining the dogs to maintain a sharp and steady focus as well as enjoy themselves while undergoing testing was key. An MRI machine requires the subject to remain perfectly still in a tightly enclosed space while being subjected to loud thumping sounds. Luckily, Berns found the perfect training partner in Mark Spivak, who was confident that positive reinforcement and clicker training could shape the dogs’ behavior so that they would freely and voluntarily maintain the required position. As it turned out, Spivak was right.\nInitial findings showed evidence that dogs empathize with humans and have a theory of mind, and, by extension, that the idea that you must be your dog’s pack leader is a mistake. As Berns notes, “Callie was a sentient being who understood, at some level, what I was thinking and reciprocated by communicating her thoughts within her behavioral repertoire.”\nDo dogs ask questions?\nQuestioning is very important in human group behavior because it shows interest in someone else’s thoughts. Do dogs have the ability to ask questions throughvocalizationor other means? Yep, they do if you listen. “Young dogs also question us: Where do we go? Which way? Who is coming? Who goes down with me? Is it permitted? And so on. If people are careful and answer the questions, it can soon become a regular method of communication with the dog. If questions do not get attention, dogs give up, just like human children,” says Csányi. But it’s not a one-way street; you can also ask your dog questions and get their input on their likes and dislikes. “If I go for a walk with [my dog] at a crossroads, I frequently askWhich way?If I ask, then he carefully sniffs in both directions and selects the ‘better’ one, and starts to go. If I am not posing the question, then he just follows me.”\nHow can you exercise and enrich your dog’s mind?\n“They are very much social animals, like humans, and depend in their development on continuous and variable social input from the environment. This means that they do not only need to be walked twice a day, but strive for substantial social interactions, which can take the form of play or joint sporting or even training,” says Csányi.\nYour dog is your best friend, right? So treat them well. It isn’t an automatic process. You play a huge role in helping to shape your dog’s understanding of the world. If you want your dog to besmart— with training, language, behavior, or emotionally — they’ll need your help to get them there.",

    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/dog-breeding"
  },
  "page_content": "Of the 400 breeds recognized worldwide today, more than two-thirds were created in the last 150 years. There’s no doubt that dog breed shows and their requisite breed standard for appearance played a big part in subdividing breeds, shrinking gene pools, and diminishinggenetic diversity. Breed appearance standards are indeed powerful. As a tool, language plays an important role by which innovation — in this case, of a sentient human-bred domestic animal — is further developed. Or, as the AKC says,refined. Learn how breed standards have influenced how we regard, understand, and think about dogs.\nUnfolding Dog Genetics\nIn the world of mammals, the domestic dog —Canis lupus familiaris, a subspecies of the gray wolf — reigns as the most morphologically diverse. On one end, there’s the 155-pound South Russian Ovcharka, and on the other, the seven-pound Silky Terrier. This incredible variety can be attributed partly to the dog’s basic template, which can be customized by manipulating an unexpectedly small number of genes.For instance, 95 percent of all five canine fur textures and lengths (the Afghan Hound and Curly-Coated Retriever curiously excepted) are orchestrated by three genes. And just six or seven locations in a dog’s genome account for nearly 80 percent of dogs’ vast size and weight differences. (In humans, these genes number in the hundreds, if not thousands). A single mutation, shared by 14 diminutive breeds, determines that a dog will be small, and another is responsible for the long-bodied, short-legged nature of numerous dwarf breeds.Clearly, dog breeds aren’t quite as unique as you might have thought.Dog traitscome in packages. Flip a switch to make the legs more slender, and the skull will narrow as well. Turn down the volume on pigment and the chance of deafness increases.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThose who bred dogs had long known that traits were related, but there was little understanding of how those relationships worked; nor was there much concern. Dogs were bred for skills useful in a practical world. Once breed exhibitions became fashionable and working dogs were awarded championships based strictly on appearance, all this changed.\nAssociating Breed and Behavior\nIn 1866, John Henry Walsh (writing under the pseudonym “Stonehenge”), editor ofThe Field, the most influential hunting and kennel journal in England, was the first to describe a breed’s physical characteristics with phrases that he believed were equivalent to its field ability. A bird dog judged perfect to a well-written breed standard would, by the logic of the day, perform perfectly in the field.At the time, horsemen and sportsmen were the dog influencers (women became active later), and many of the arcane descriptions in breed standards are borrowed from those fields. Today, breed standards serve three purposes: assessment in competition; delineation of unique qualities in different breeds, some very much alike; and maintenance of breed similarity throughout the world.\nA new study found that a dog’s breed accounts for less than 10 percent of their behavior.\nThe question is, what happens to purebred dogs when language, intrinsically fluid and inexact, is used to suspend change in morphology and behavior? In speaking with experienced American Kennel Club (AKC) breeders, specialty judges, and breed historians, we gain some insight into specific ways that a standardized lexicon can influence change in pedigreed dogs far beyond what is intended.\nDogs in Translation\nBreed standard translations are more like corrections or clarifications. When standards are clarified, they usually get longer and, consequently, more exclusive. A standard that calls for feet to be “round, compact, catlike, standing well upon the toe pads,” is more restrictive than one that says feet must be “close, round and firm.” Revisionists tread cautiously because an imprecisely rephrased standard can have an impact on a breed’s genetic diversity.Amending a standard for any reason is controversial. As one Greyhound breeder observed, “The torch handed to us was the perfect coursing dog. Our standard is taken word for word from what was written in the 1860s. If we added more words to make it more explicit, it may end up being a Greyhound different than the one each one of us has in our head.”But progress necessitates change. A handful of words differentiate an apple, an orange, or a pear, but 13 varieties of apples require a larger lexicon. In his 1576 treatise,Of Englishe Dogges: The Diversities, the Names, the Natures, and the Properties, cynologist John Caius described the generic land Spaniel in 58 words: “The most part of their skins are white and if they be marked with any spots, they are commonly red, and somewhat great therewithal, the hairs not growing in such thickness but that the mixture of them may easily be perceived. Other some of them be reddish and blackish, but of that sort there be but a few.” Today, Caius’s dog has morphed into 13 flushing Spaniel breeds. The Field Spaniel standard uses 973 words, short in comparison to the English Springer Spaniel standard, a 2,040 word descriptor.Occasionally, words are added to explain what something isnot. As one breed standard committee member noted, “There were lots of questions from judges about the preferred shape of the eye opening. So we said it’s acceptable as long as it’s not this, that, or the other thing.” And at a California dog show, pointing to Mastiffs benched only a few feet from his St. Bernards, an exhibitor told me, “Sometimes breed clubs have to lengthen standards to differentiate their breeds from others so similar that, if marked differently, could be shown as Saints.”\nIf your heart is set on a purebred pup, start your search at breed-specific rescue organizations.\nWhen Words Fail\nAt the Westminster dog show, AKC VIPs sipped their drinks and talked candidly about breed standards. A Doberman breeder, specialty, and all-breed judge opined, “When people bred to the standard, the animal changed and became what the words described. Also, some groups wrote the standard and have not been able to breed to that ideal, so now, they change the nuance of the words to fit the breed ideal. Making the dogs fit the words, and not vice-versa, is wrong.”Sometimes breed standards include terms that are subjective or indefinite. Or as one judge said, “If the standard calls for a short muzzle, judges select dogs based on the shortest muzzles in the ring. The breed’s muzzle gets shorter and shorter. So you have to ask, ‘Shorter than what?’” This leads to the problems currently associated with brachycephalic breeds.Some breedersget so fixated on one attribute of the traditional standard that they are willing to sacrifice something more important. “For example, they may create a broad head but are willing to accept shorter legs and a longer back in order to do so,” another judge observed.Breed standards, like all nomenclature, are subject to the rules of language. Like the dog it describes, vocabulary is deceptively capricious and unexpectedly fluid. A good example is size. Big breeds are getting bigger. As I was told by a breed historian in reference to St. Bernards, “What was bred to be powerful and strong in 1900 would not be considered powerful and strong today. Like an automobile in 1915, it was powerful then but not compared to now.” If a standard describes a breed as strong and powerful, the ideal dog gets bigger.Rather than hack away at standards, some breed clubs hold seminars for judges in which contemporary nuances of an indefinite vocabulary are refined. Others reluctantly reword phrases to accommodate inexperienced newcomers. Some clubs don’t revise words, but instead, reinterpret their meanings. Take English Bulldogs, for example. As an owner of one of these stocky dogs remarked, “The interpretation of words has changed. The Victorian [Bull]dog was a transition dog, less bulky, less massive, taller, leaner, and is now thicker and more compact.” Another handler observed that “one of the issues in the standard is weight. It calls for 45 to 50 pounds. But it has no height restriction, so a higher-station dog might be thinner.” The 1910 dog was a much taller and leaner dog compared to today’s stout fireplug variety, but both are considered to have been bred correctly to the standard.You can have the same words in several breed standards, but that don’t mean the same thing. Take the word ‘almond-shaped’ to describe the eyes of a German Shepherd Dog — if you look at other breed standards, both the Collie and American Cocker Spaniel call for almond-shaped eyes. Even though the Collie has a small triangular eye and Cocker Spaniel’s eye bulges out from the skull.\nVeterinarians must do more to discourage the breeding of animals with conditions known to seriously compromise their welfare.\nBreeding for Appearance Over Behavior\nThe AKC considers itself a club of clubs. Owners intent on breed registration must first demonstrate that a majority of breeders are interested in establishing a national breed club. Who gets to be in that club is at the heart of a mounting number of controversies.\nIn 1994, the AKC Labrador Retriever standard was revised to exclude dogs less than 22 inches at the withers. Some breeders whose dogs no longer met the standard were part of an $11 million class-action suit against the AKC Labrador Retriever Parent Club (the national organization designated by AKC to represent the breed), claiming that height restrictions excluding shorter dogs no longer described the Labrador Retriever: if you make a bigger dog, you make a different dog. A litigant told me, “It’s perfectly reasonable to change a breed, but the dog should have a different name.” They tried and failed to trademark the name Labrador Retriever; the judge sided with the AKC parent club.\nThe shorter-legged, more compact field-bred Lab continues to be shown in Canada, the UK and other countries that don’t disqualify individuals based on size. In the U.S., conformation and companion Labs are getting increasingly larger. Will diseases linked to large size compromise the American line? Time will tell.\nThe Border Collie war began in 1988, when the American Border Collie Association and others heard rumblings that some wanted to register the breed for conformation showing, which requires a breed standard. This idea didn’t go over well with herding trial enthusiasts because a Border Collie is what it does, not what it looks like. Any dog can enter an open sheepdog trial. There are no age, size, color, shape, or breed restrictions, and registration is not required. Unlike registeredpurebreds, whose lineage must be proven in ancient studbooks, many Border Collie champions are registered on merit (ROM). In theory, a Pomeranian who could prove its worth at a sheepdog trial could, by performance, be called a Border Collie.In the minds of many, AKC conformation specifications threatened 200 years of breeding for performance, not looks. Led by Donald McCaig, the group prepared for battle. McCaig worte: “Hands off the Border Collie! We own Border Collies. Our dogs are companion dogs, obedience dogs, and livestock-herding dogs. For hundreds of years, Border Collies have been bred to strict performance standards and today, they’re the soundest, most trainable dogs in the world. The AKC wants to push them out of the Miscellaneous Class and into the show ring. They seek a conformation standard [appearance standard] for the breed. We, the officers of every single legitimate national, regional, and state Border Collie association, reject conformation breeding. Too often, the show ring fattens the puppy mills and creates unsound dogs. We will not permit the AKC to ruin our dogs.”They filed to legally trademark the name but, like the Lab litigants, lost in court. In 1997, the first Border Collie was shown in conformation at Westminster. In interviewing a handler/owner who had been instrumental in writing the standard. She said, looking visibly distraught, “Right before you got here, a prominent breeder came by and said he will breed a dog with the head held higher. The head has to do with movement in the field, in making eye contact with the sheep, the pattern of behavior that has evolved from two centuries of work. Now I regret having fought so hard for this. The standard should not threaten the dog as a working animal, but I believe it now will.”\nAs a consequence of the acrimonious Border Collie war, few working dog breeders had a desire to become specialty judges, so the fate of the conformation dog was left in the hands of generalist judges who lacked sheepdog trial experience. As predicted, the standard created a split type: working dogs continue to be a rag-tag group, dissimilar in shape, size and color, but the same in their relentless determination to move sheep from one place to another. In contrast, AKC dogs look very similar, but their ability to herd sheep is open to question. Are both types called Border Collies? Formally, yes, but the AKC show Border Collie is widely, popularly and even affectionately known as the “Barbie Collie” by some: pretty as a picture but as blandly attractive and vacuous as the doll from which the name derives.\nAt about the same time the Border Collie war was raging, AKC enthusiasts saw an opportunity to register the Jack Russell Terrier (JRT), an irascible, independent dog with an intense work ethic, extremely diverse genome, and phenotype as dissimilar as that of the Border Collie. Many Jack Russell Terrier breeders vehemently opposed the action, claiming that the breed’s physical and working characteristics would be jeopardized by this move. Nevertheless, the splinter group formed the requisite national breed club, named itself the Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association (JRTBA) and gained AKC recognition in 2001.A lawsuit ensued. After an expensive court battle, the name Jack Russell Terrier was awarded to the working phenotype and the AKC changed the conformation dog’s name to Parson Russell Terrier. The AKC parent club is now the Parson Russell Terrier Association of America. “The Jack Russell Terrier is a feisty, very aggressive, very tough dog. But middle-class urbanites don’t really want that kind of dog. They want a dog that will be a good pet,” says author Alston Chase, who bred the working terrier since the 1970s.The public took notice of the rather obscure breed when it became a media darling in the 1980s. The breed was misrepresented as a mischievous lap dog on shows like the NBC sitcom Frasier. Surprised and disappointed by their dogs’ ornery personalities and exercise requirements, urban pet owners abandoned JRTs at shelters in record numbers.According to Chase, one of only a handful of people in the U.S. continuing to breed the old-fashioned dog, “We’re doing what we can to prevent extinction of the original breed, but people aren’t in love with the value of diversity in the dog. They want dogs that look alike.”\nNow, the old-fashioned Jack Russell Terrier can hardly be found. Like theOld English Bulldogwho faded away with the passage of the 1835 Cruelty to Animals Act and the Wolfhound who died out with the demise of the wolf in the British Isles, the pre-AKC JRT will likely disappear as well.\nBy breeding for conformation and appearance, breeders may be breeding away from desirablebehavior, even putting alleles (forms of a gene) at risk for extinction. It’s all up to chance which genes are swept up.",

So, sometimes the enclosure contained a roommate of the dog being tested with the tokens; other times, it was an unfamiliar dog; and occasionally, it was empty. In some trials, a third dog was next to the dog being tested when they were choosing whether to touch the token to give food away. Sometimes they were alone when making their choice.\nWhy relationships change in multi-dog households.\nWhy Do Dogs Share?\nResearchers found that dogs were more likely to share food in certain circumstances.\nDogs were more likely to give food to dogs who they live with than to dogs who are strangers.\nDogs were more likely to give food to dogs who they live with than to dogs who are strangers.\nHaving another dog with them made them more generous, meaning that they were more likely to give food when they were with another dog rather than when they were alone.\nHaving another dog with them made them more generous, meaning that they were more likely to give food when they were with another dog rather than when they were alone.\nTo be fair, the dogs were not literally sharing the food out of their own bowl. (Food aggressionis a real problem with some dogs.) They were choosing to act so that food would be given to another dog, but they didn’t lose out on any food by providing food to the other dog. Still, it’s nice to know that dogs can share food, even if what we most appreciate about them is their ability toshare love.",

  "page_content": "If you have an urge to create discord and angst, here’s one way to do it: Go to a dog behavior conference or seminar and boldly state, “I think we should discuss the meaning of the term ‘prey drive,’ and decide whether or not we should continue to use it.” Then, make a dash for the exit before it gets ugly.\nWhat is Prey Drive?\nThe term “prey drive” refers to a dog’s eagerness or desire, related to chasing and capturing prey. But, the terminology employed to describe canine behavior is messy, perhaps in part because dog behavior encompasses a number of disciplines, among them ethology, evolution, physiology, neurobiology, sociology, psychology, learning theory and animal husbandry.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nIt’s a trait that makes many dogs successful in the world of canine sports. The term is often used by people whose dogs participate in agility or fly ball as well as by those whose dogs work in search and rescue or law enforcement. Additionally, it has become increasingly popular when discussing dogs with various behavioral issues, typically issues related to chasing (cars, squirrels, runners, bikes, children) and the resulting difficulty inteaching them to comeor topay attentionin general around any of these distractions.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s pro tips for walking a pup that wantsto chase everything that moves.\nSometimes “prey drive” is used in a positive sense, as in, “She’s excited about working because she has a high prey drive. I love her enthusiasm and motivation, and the prey drive gives her such great endurance too.” It can also be used in a negative way, as in, “I can never let her off-leash in areas that aren’t fenced in. She has such high prey drive that she’ll chase anything. I can’t trust her to come back or stay out of trouble.” So, though prey drive is commonly used in the dog world, many people dislike it.\nAre Dogs Driven to Chase?\nFrom an ethological perspective, the term “prey drive” doesn’t make sense. If you ask an ethologist (someone who studies the behavior of animals in their natural environments) who isn't involved in the “dog world” — and the vast majority of them aren’t — what they think of the term, they will look at you quizzically and then criticize it on the grounds that it’s nonsensical.\nTo ethologists, the word “drive” refers to an unknown and variable internal state that explains why an animal’s response to a stimulus is not identical every time the animal is exposed to it. For example, at times, a dog may charge after a tennis ball with gleaming eyes and an over-the-top bouncy enthusiasm, while at other times, that same dog may lazily lope after the ball or even ignore it, though the stimulus (the thrown ball) is the same. What’s different is the dog’s interest in or motivation to chase it.\n“Drive” is the term used to explain that difference, which ethologists consider to be a difference in internal states, perhaps based on neurological or physiological variables over time.\nFluctuation in an animal’s drive doesn’t just affect predatory behavior. It also influences how eager a dog is to eat, drink and engage in sexual behavior, or any other type of behavior for that matter. Yet, we don’t talk about food drive, water drive or potential-mating-partner drive. We say that a dog is hungry or food-motivated (or achowhound); that the dog is thirsty; or, in the case of females, that she is sexually receptive. To be fair, the term “sex drive” is used to describe the state of having an interest in mating — referring typically (but not always) to males — but we don’t say female drive or male drive.\nChase? Wrestle? Tug-o-war? Find out which are fair game.\nEven in the way that many people use it, prey drive lacks precision. Does it mean a drive to run, to chase, to catch something, to bite it, to kill it or any combination of these? Is it all related to predatory behavior, and if so, why is the term “prey drive” used, rather than “predatory drive”\nPrey Drive, Aggression and Impulse Control\nWords and phrases that express precise concepts are indispensable for communication, and the more specific we can be, the better. However, the inexactness of language can make it a challenge to convey precise meanings. For example, because English is short on words that describe emotional nuance, people say things such as, “Do you like him or do youlikehim?”\nSome people feel that the word “drive” doesn’t actually explain an animal’s behavior. In one sense, it’s an oversimplification to say that an animal is behaving a certain way because of an internal state or a change in that internal state. We know that an animal’s motivation changes over time and that different members of the same species behave differently in the presence of identical stimuli, but we don’t often know why. So, the term is more descriptive and less explanatory than it purports to be. A label such as “prey drive” is essentially a shorthand way to describe what we don’t understand since we don’t have complete knowledge of dogs’ internal states and their effect on behavior.\nAnother problem with prey drive is that it is often used in an attempt to explain a dog’s unwanted behavior toward other dogs and even people, neither of which are normally objects of canine predatory focus. We’ve all heard people dismiss a dog’s inappropriate, undesirable and sometimes even aggressive behavior with the comment that the dog has a high prey drive. It sounds so much nicer than saying that the dog has littleimpulse control, a far-from-ideal temperament or has not been the beneficiary of sufficient training.\nBetter Suited Term?\nCriticisms of the phrase may be a predictable result of the fact that often, when terms are appropriated from other fields, they are used in a slightly different way. The current meaning of terms in our field may not match their original use, which can cause confusion and thus, a tendency to consider that the way the terms are being used is “wrong.” The concept of drive, which comes from the academic discipline of ethology, has come to mean something different, though related, in the world of dogs.\nIt’s wise to acknowledge that terms have to be considered in context. Would it be better if no such confusion ever arose and multiple meanings didn’t exist? Sure, there would be advantages, but the reality is that languages change, as do fields of study and their associated terminology.\nIn case you’ve ever wondered what it’s like to live in a dog society.\nCultures vary in the way they accept and integrate shifting meanings in the language used to describe the world around them. On one extreme, the French are well known for their strong national pride in the stability of their language, and the great importance they place on maintaining le bon usage (the correct usage) and resisting change, particularly Anglicisms. At the other extreme is the surfer culture with its enthusiastic proliferation of new words and phrases such as “tubular,” “hang ten,” “in the soup” and “goofy footed.” Americans generally accept new words and phrases easily, accounting for the rapid spread of “going postal,” “cougar,” “to be plutoed” and, most recently, “Tebowing.”\nFinding a Balance\nWhile some folks enjoy referring to “predatory drift” and “reactivity” (the term “aggression” used to suffice), and “prey drive.” Others would prefer to hear that a dog isenthusiasticabout agility or fly ball, or that the dog ismotivatedto run the course, take the jumps or retrieve a ball. What’s important is that we understand one another.\nThe reality is that when most people talk about prey drive in dogs, they are referring to the enthusiasm and strong motivation that makes dogs sharp on the course, eager to participate and reliably give their all in competition or in play.",

  "page_content": "Ariel, my Doberman, lies restrained on her back. She is surrounded by strangers, in a room with frightening smells. In an effort to keep cancer at bay, she has been poked, jabbed, and invaded for more than a year and has now developed one of chemotherapy’s dreaded side effects: an inflamed bladder wall, which is hemorrhagic and painful.The doctor positions the long needle as the ultrasonographer guides its placement via the monitor. Hugging and kissing her, I cannot watch as the needle plunges into her bladder to retrieve its specimen. Yet I know the moment it happens — Ariel’s eyes dilate like deployed airbags, and she turns and tenderly cleans my face until the hurt is withdrawn. This contact is considered by many researchers to be part of the mechanism of the placebo effect at work in dogs.\nPlacebo Effect on Animals\nPlacebo is “the beneficial effect that arises from a patient’s expectations from a treatment, rather than from the treatment itself.” Does the placebo effect exist in dogs? Until recently, the presumed answer was a resounding no, because animals were thought to lack the cognitive capacity to understand the intent of medical care or the power of suggestion, or to have hope of recovery.What a howl! Such nonsense is summarily dispelled by two pages of technical references underpinning a recent veterinary journal article entitled “The placebo effect in animals,” which documents in detail the existence of the placebo effect in dogs, among other species. A subsequent article, “Effects of human contact on animal health and well-being,” follows up with even more scientific references regarding the substantial benefits of this adjunct therapy.Both of the articles suggest that the placebo effect in veterinary medicine can enhance the efficacy of medical treatment, and findings make a “strong scientific argument for encouraging in-hospital visitation by owners when animals are hospitalized.”\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nHelp your dog stay fit and flexible with these stretch techniques by a certified pet strength and conditioning specialist.\nExperimental studies on the mechanisms of the placebo effect in animals have been underway for at least 70 years. Components of this phenomenon, including belief, expectation, and trust, are presumed to be present at a neurobiological level, though cellular mechanisms remain unknown.In humans, the placebo effect is generally ascribed to one or more of the following: classical conditioning, expectation, and endogenous opiates (the body’s own naturally produced pain relief). In animals, interestingly, a fourth mechanism is also theorized: the effect of human contact. Numerous studies have documentedpositive physiologic and health effectsas a result of animals’ visual and tactile contact with a human. The ability of human contact to optimize an animal’s comfort and well-being provides a strong rationale for pet owners being present for many medical procedures.A recent double-blind veterinary study involved arthritic dogs randomly assigned to either a treatment or a placebo group. Their response to treatment was objectively assessed by force-plate analysis, which precisely measures the use of individual limbs while a dog is in motion. The result? Fifty-six percent of placebo-treated dogs had an objectively measured, significant, positive response.\nHey, man. It’s all about those chemical messengers. See how Adaptil can help your pup.\nPositive Effects on the Body\nWhen a person strokes a dog, substantial decreases in the dog’s heart rate can be noted.Human contactalso consistently elicits major positive changes in canine blood pressure and aortic and coronary blood flow. The placebo effect in animals on immunomodulation, cardiovascular disease, drug withdrawal, tumor growth and much more is well documented. The proverbial bottom line is that an animal’s mental and emotional state has a profound influence upon its physical health. And, human contact has a positive impact on the well-being of animals of all age groups, and produces an array of physiologic, emotional, and health effects.Upon discharging Wendy, my beloved, gentle, 11-year-old Doberman to my care, clinicians at the veterinary school advised me to “take her home and love her, she has two to three weeks to live.” I knew this to be correct. Only a few cases have ever survived Wendy’s untreatable and rare cancer for several months, and those who did required intensive, constant medication. After a month of blood transfusions, a last-ditch effort that in recorded practice has never worked, Wendy became incompatible with all available blood from canine blood banks.On a hunch, I had her red-and-rust son’s blood tested and found that it was compatible. I communed with her, telling her that this would be the last transfusion; I also promised to discontinue other treatments and stay close by, enveloping her in love. One year later, with no further intervention, Wendy still warms my side. The veterinary school clinicians are in disbelief. There is truly no medical explanation.That’s all right. I’ll take Ariel, Wendy, and the placebo effect any day.\nMcMillan, Franklin D. “The placebo effect in animals.” J Am Vet Med Assoc 1999; 215, No. 7:992–999.McMillan, Franklin D. “Effects of human contact on animal health and well-being.” J Am Vet Med Assoc 1999; 215, No. 11:1592–1598.",

  "page_content": "How do dogs react to the solar eclipse? Some believe that dogs might appear upset or frightened, and perhaps howl, run away, or seek cover — similar reactions associated with fireworks. But, most dogs don’t really even care. If you are wondering if you need to do anything special to protect your dog’s eyes, luckily most experts say there is little need to worry.\nA dog’s perspective on the eclipse\nUnlike humans, dogs don't rely heavily on vision to make sense of the world. Their primary senses are smell and hearing. When it comes to an eclipse, they might notice the dimming of light, but it doesn't have the same significance for them as it does for us.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n“On a normal day, your pets don’t try to look at the sun, and therefore don’t damage their eyes. And on this day, they’re not going to do it, either,” Angela Speck, director of astronomy and a professor of astrophysics at the University of Missouri, said at a news conference with NASA.\nAnimal behaviorist Karen London on how the time change will affect your cat or dog.\nDogs also lack the cultural and scientific understanding of celestial events. They live in the present, focusing on immediate stimuli, like the scent of a tree or the sound of a squirrel. Solar eclipses hold no intrinsic meaning or threat in their world.\nIt is still important to keep them safe\nMelanie Monteiro, teacher of online pet first-aid classes and the author ofThe Safe-Dog Handbook, says animals shouldn’t need the same eye protection. “There’s really no reason to be concerned about that,” she toldTODAY. “Dogs and cats don’t normally look up into the sun, so you don’t need to get any special eye protection for your pets.”\nBut if you are taking your dog out while watching the eclipse it is important to keep them on leash. And make sure if you are looking up at the eclipse (with special eclipse glasses, of course), that your dog doesn’t take your cue to “look” at what is making you freak out if you get overly excited.\nOther things you can do for your pup include:\nStick to Routine:Maintain your regular schedule for feeding, bathroom breaks, and playtime.\nStick to Routine:Maintain your regular schedule for feeding, bathroom breaks, and playtime.\nID and Microchip:Make sure they have proper identification, including a collar with an updated tag and a microchip — just in case.\nID and Microchip:Make sure they have proper identification, including a collar with an updated tag and a microchip — just in case.\nComfort:If your pup appears anxious because of the eclipse, provide them a comfortable spot to hang out, and offer a few gentle pets, familiar toys, and treats as a distraction.\nComfort:If your pup appears anxious because of the eclipse, provide them a comfortable spot to hang out, and offer a few gentle pets, familiar toys, and treats as a distraction.\n\"Animals are actually quite a bit smarter than we are when it comes to looking directly at the sun,\" saysMichelle Thaller, deputy director of science for communications at NASA, which is including the Life Responds project as part of itscitizen science outreachin conjunction with the eclipse.\nSo, even if your dog isn't spooked by the celestial event, it's probably best to keep them indoors.

  },
  "page_content": "I am obsessed with blankets. Turns out, so is my dog Leo. My blanket obsession began with a passion for textile design, which developed into a habit of buying any blanket, comforter, or quilt that caught my eye. Leo’s blanket habit is related to mine: Whenever I bring home a gorgeous coverlet, he has to chew a gigantic hole right in the middle — as soon as he is left alone with it for more than 20 seconds. While I had trouble with Leo, I’ve also learned a thing or two along the way.\nDealing With Compulsive Blanket Chewing\nSometimes I think fate must have ironically brought Leo and me together or that maybe Leo is saving me from the fate of being crushed under an avalanche of blankets when I open the linen closet. With Leo’s blanket munching, I recognized there were two issues that needed to be addressed. First, Leo could not be left alone with blankets until he learned chewing on them was inappropriate. Secondly, he needed a positive outlet for his chewing, such as a chew toy.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nKeeping Leo away from blankets worked for like a week. His tenacity for finding unattended blankets was borderline inspiring. I’d leave the bedroom door open for a minute while I went to grab clothes from the dryer: Gigantic hole in the blanket. I’d take a catnap on the sofa: Down feathers everywhere when I awoke.\nSince keeping him away from blankets wasn’t going to happen, I tried taste deterrents like bitter spray misted onto the blankets. Apparently, the only one affected by this was me. Many a nap was rudely ended by a bitter taste. After falling asleep in a blanket cocoon on the sofa (exhausted from watching back-to-back-to-back episodes of Cake Boss), my open mouth would inevitably make contact with the surface of the blanket. It was heinously gross. Meanwhile, Leo would power through the nasty flavor. For my sake, I gave up on the bitter spray.\nHow to teach your dog to enjoy, notdestroy, their toys.\nMy plan to redirect Leo’s affection from blankets to toys has been even less successful. Even after taking Leo to dog training, specifically to pique his interest in toys, he drifts after more than 20 seconds unless it is something he can eat (like a bully chew or a Kong toy). I see a future with a morbidly obese dog curled happily on elegant, intact quilts.\nThe reality is Leo and I both have issues that need to be dealt with (though I’d like to think that I can curb my blanket-purchasing habit as soon as I can curb Leo’s blanket-eating habit). What next? Do I give Leo one blanket and designate it ashis? Do I concede that maybe I won’t have nice blankets ever? Why does he have an obsession with blankets?\nWhy Do Dogs Chew on Blankets?\nDogs are instinctive chewers that explore the world with their mouths so it is better to give them their own chew toys, blankets, and ropes rather than sacrifice your blankets, bedding, and furniture. “Chewing can help relieve stress and anxiety, keep their teeth clean, and keep their minds stimulated,” says Dr. Lori Teller, a clinical associate professor at the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine. “Puppies also chew to relieve the pain and irritation of teething.” Here are a few reasons why dogs chew:\nBoredom buster\nBoredom buster\nStress relief\nStress relief\nPuppy teething\nPuppy teething\nIt feels good\nIt feels good\nMental stimulation\nMental stimulation\nHow to Stop Your From Dog Chewing Blankets\nHere are some tips that might work to stop your dog from chewing holes in your blankets. When in doubt, if you think the problem might be a medical issue, check in with your vet to make sure everything is okay, especially if the chewing turns into eating.\nMany dogs are prone to chewing or more destructive behaviors because they are bored. Exercise helps! In my case, Leo was already getting plenty of exercise, but it is a crucial starting point for anyone experiencing this problem.\nChewing is a completely normal behavior in dogs, so it can be challenging to train against their nature. One option is to provide the dog a blanket that is theirs and okay to chew (assuming their interest isn’t ineating the blanket). Sure, the blanket will turn into a shredded mess, but it’stheirshredded mess.\nWith some dogs, blanket chewing is anadolescent phasewhile they are teething; for others, it simply grows into a comforting tool. If your dog is young and still teething, you might find soft toys or stuffies are something that works.\nThey work, even if it is just for a brief blanket chewing break. No better tool in keeping dogs busy than astuffed kong.“Remove any toy that has reached the size where it can become a choking hazard or cause an intestinal obstruction,” says Teller. “If your dog chews off large pieces of the toy and swallows them, then that toy should also be taken away.”",

  "page_content": "As humans, we are part of a long chain of evolution connecting back to a shared branch with so many other primates on this planet. And yet, dogs understand us better than any chimpanzee. Really. It’s science.\nThe theory is that dogs are capable of communicating with their people, not because we train them, but because they evolved alongside us, and the ones who did the best with tricks survived on our generous treats. Read on to find out how researchers figured it out.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nDo dogs understand humans?\nBack in the late aughts, there wasn’t a huge wealth of scientific knowledge on the cognitive capabilities of domestic animals, especially dogs. Many scientists were more interested in studying exotic animals or interested only in animal understanding as it relates to human cognition. “Physically, domesticated animals have smaller brains than wild specimens of the species,” says Brian Hare, aNew York Timesbestselling author and professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke University. “People think that domesticated animals are dumb.”\nWhen Hare was getting started as an anthropology student at Harvard, he began studying the cognitive capabilities of chimpanzees. While working with our closest living relatives, he thought about playing fetch with his dog in the backyard as a kid.\nWhile chimps generally failed to read his basic physical communications, Hare recalled how his dog wouldfollow his pointed fingerto a hidden stick or ball. “I was studying how chimp cognition compared to human cognition, and the chimps were doing poorly,” he says. “I thought to myself, ‘My dog can do this. This is ridiculous.’”\nStudies explain dogs’ ability to follow gestures.\nHare abandoned the nation’s premier science facilities and their chimps and traveled to his parent’s garage in Atlanta, where his subjects became Daisy and Oreo — two Labrador Retrievers. He gave them some simple tests, which boosted his plan to understand canine cognition.\nHare was in new territory. Ray Coppinger, professor of biology at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, and author of Dogs:A Startling New Understanding of Canine Origin, Behavior, and Evolution, supported Hare’s quest. “Hare [was] trying to get at the deeper message — the suggestion that dogs have minds,” Coppinger says.\nIn order to better learn why dogs understand us like they do, Hare assembled a team to perform astudyat the Boston Wolf Sanctuary, in a German laboratory, and stateside at Harvard. The group’s main test worked like this: An experimenter hid a piece of food in one of two containers, and the subject (either a dog, wolf, or chimp), who did not see where the food was hidden, was allowed to choose one. But, before giving them a choice, the experimenter gave a clue indicating the food’s location, for example, by looking at, pointing to, tapping on, or placing a marker on the correct container.\nResearchers say dogs actually have a pretty good sense of what we’re thinking.\n“The idea was to compare our closest relative, chimps, to dogs and wolves and see who is more expert at reading humans,” says Hare. “We thought we’d use chimps as the yardstick; it turned out that dogs are the experts,” says Hare.\nJust as Hare suspected, dogs were better than chimps and wolves at understanding human social cues to find food. They were also more skilled as puppies, regardless of age or rearing history. “What was fascinating was discovering that dogs don’t require exposure to humans to use these social cues,” says Hare. “The big surprise for me was the puppies.” Regardless of how puppies are raised, they’re still tuned into our cues.\nHow do dogs understand humans?\nSo, it turns out that dogs didn’t inherit their human-reading skills from wolves or because they experienced intense exposure to humans throughout their lives. Instead, these results provide the strongest support that dogs’ social-communicative skills with humans were acquired during the process of domestication.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\n“We sought to discover the origin of this ability,” says Hare. “We showed that there has been cognitive evolution; there has been a change in the cognitive abilities of dogs as a result of evolution. Dogs who could read human cues were more likely to survive, more likely to reproduce and pass their genes on to the next generation.”\nWhy it matters.\nOne immediate benefit of the study is how it could influence dog trainers professionally.\n“The message for trainers is that they may not need to train dogs so heavily,” Hare says. “Dogs are so good at flexibly using social cues; over-training can be worse than not training at all. Over-training may make a dog less flexible.”\nCoppinger agrees. “From a training point of view, if the average dog owner thought their dog had a mind, it could affect how humanely they treat the animal,” he says.\nHare adds, “It seems as though dogs, potentially through evolution, have been molded to be sensitive to human needs. I don’t think dog owners were surprised by my findings. This is something that all dog owners intuitively know is true.” But now they have the data to prove it.",

  "page_content": "You might think that threat displays — when a dog growls, barks, stiffens their body, or bares their front teeth — leads to serious aggression. But actually they can prevent an altercation, which is why many of them occur without ever leading to a real fight.

Dogs can assess each other, and often one or more decide that to proceed would be unwise.\nSilent Dog Aggression\nOn the flip side, dogs whonever give any warningbefore behaving aggressively are the most frightening and potentially dangerous.

As long as the dogs are attempting to communicate with one another, there is some possibility that they are seeking to end the conflict. If the dogs have no interest in working out the conflict or to de-escalate the aggression, then the dogs are most likely serious about injuring each other. Quiet fights and quiet attacks involve dogs who are most likely actually trying to cause injury, rather than trying to reach a peaceful resolution.\nAlthough personality differences in how much individual dogs tend to vocalize can influence how loud an attack or fight is, and a victim dog may make piercing yelps and screams while the attacker remains silent, I still generally find that quiet incidents result in the most damage. Of course, there are also tons of exceptions. Unfortunately, many people and dogs are seriously injured by dogs making a big ruckus.",

  "page_content": "Not a week goes by that I don’t get asked what kinds of dogs I think are the most dangerous. When people wonder about the “kinds” ofdangerous dogs, they typically think about breeds. But breed doesn’t have anything to do with it. People should focus on individual dogs and specific circumstances rather than a dog’s breed.\nDogs rarely, if ever,bite without warnings, and sometimes those signs of trouble have been going on for months or even years before the bite happens. Here’s the thing: the problem isn’t unpredictable dogs. It’s misunderstood dogs. Dogs often try hard to communicate that they are uncomfortable or don’t like what is happening to them. But if nobody understands those messages, the dogs continue to be in situations that make them unhappy, and some of those dogs may end up biting.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nAs a professional behaviorist and trainer, I know we need to better educate people about the red flags of potentialaggression in dogs. Red flags exist but are not always picked up on. Here’s what you need to know about dangerous dogs.\nFive most dangerous dogs\nWhile not every dog in these categories is dangerous, it’s important to be aware that there is an increased risk of dog bites when dealing with these types of dogs or dogs in these situations.\nDogs who arescared, nervous, oranxiousmay panic and act aggressively in order to protect themselves. And remember, awagging taildoes not mean that a dog is friendly. Being afraid is at the root of more dog aggression than any other factor.\nIf a dog has noboundariesand has never been taught how to behave, they are more likely to injure someone — perhaps by accident. People (especially children) are often bitten, scared, or hurt by dogs chasing them or jumping up on them.\nHow to teach your pup to play nice.\nIf a dog’s behavior is confusing and does not follow any obvious pattern, it’s easy to be taken off guard by their actions or inadvertently do something that upsets them. Don’t touch a dog who issleeping,eating, orchewing a toy. Respect their space — startled dogs are more likely to bite.\nJust like people, dogs are not at their best when they don’t feel well and most would prefer not to be bothered. Dogs don’t have many ways to let us know thatthey’re in painor that they want to beleft alone. They sometimes resort to agrowl, snap, or bite, especially if they’ve already tried to walk away and go off by themselves, and that didn’t get the message across.\nNot all dogs consider everyone a friend immediately. Many dogs need time to warm up to new people and don’t like being treated as a long-lost friend within five seconds of being introduced. Treating an unfamiliar dog like your best friend can be off-putting to some and lead to aggressive behavior. If you adore all dogs, remember that the feeling of love at first sight may not always be mutual.\nInsurance companies’ breed-restriction lists take a bite out of housing options\nAre certain dog breeds more dangerous?\nStereotyping breedsto predict aggressive behavior is not useful or fair. The predictability of aggression based on a dog’s breed is highly overrated. The idea of breed bans or rejecting certain animals simply because their relatives have misbehaved is not going to get us anywhere.\nCertain breeds are getting more bad press than they deserve, and aggression is a stereotype that seems to stick, even if other generalities are fitting. For example, most people with a Pit Bull know their pitty is more likely to lick an intruder to death than bite them. Yet, most of what wehear aboutis Pit Bull aggression, not excessive licking. Rottweilers and Dobermans are also breeds that many people fear on sight without any actual data about the particular animal in question.\nBreed-specific legislation has profound impacts on families, their dogs, and animal welfare professionals.\nOn the other hand, there’s no denying that certain lines of dogs that have been bred for aggression do exhibit it. Regrettably, aggression is easy to breed for if that is someone’s intent. However, not all members of breeds who have been bred for aggression are from lines with that sort of breeding history.Nurture is key, and anyone can make a fearful, aggressive dog with improper care.\nIn my experience, some dog breeds who more commonly have aggression issues are Golden Retrievers and Labrador Retrievers. Are these bad dogs? Aggressive breeds? Of course not. They are justcommon breeds, so statistically are more likely to be noted as aggressive. Any breed can have an aggression issue. Aggression is far more predictable based on a dog’s previous behavior than on the breed.\nWhy do dogs bite?\nIt’s important when working with an aggressive dog to understand as much as possible about why the dog is biting. Some dogs bite because of fear, because they feel threatened, because they’re in pain, or they feel overwhelmed.\nDogs use their mouths both playfully and not so playfully as puppies, and the vast majority of them develop normalbite inhibition— an understanding of what they are and are not allowed to do with their mouths. Biting is a normal part of canine behavior. While people are more inclined to hit when behaving aggressively, emotions such as anger and frustration combined with high arousal are typically involved with dogs who bite in an out-of-control way.\nSuch bites happen when dogs have the canine equivalent of a toddler’s tantrum because they don’t get what they want. Dogs who bite in these contexts are literally unable to control themselves. It is much harder to substantially improve their behavior compared with other dogs, most of whom are biting as a result of fear.\nSigns of aggression before the bite\nSome dogs already have a bite history towards dogs or people and that’s a clear warning it could happen again — especially if it was an attack that was prolonged and hard to stop. Such relentless aggression is a serious red flag that the dog has trouble with inhibition.\nOther typical warning signs that a dog may bite include growling, barking, lunging, tooth displaying especially with an offensive pucker, a tendency to get frustrated, difficulty calming down after getting revved up, going stiff, tongue flicking, charging at anything of interest, hard stares directed at another individual, facial expressions indicating nervousness or discomfort, becoming mouthy when in an aroused state, excessive sniffing of the ground in social situations, guarding food or toys and being fearful of people, animals, or any other object.\nA PSA to pay better attention to our best friends’ body language.\nWhat to do if your dog has signs of aggression\nAny of these signs, or even the general feeling that something is amiss, warrants a consultation with a person trained to deal with serious behavioral problems in dogs, such as a certified applied animal behaviorist, trainer, or veterinarian board certified in behavior. It’s better to get ahead of aggression withgood training.\nIt’s also helpful to get an outside perspective on how you interact with your dog and your home life, or other environments you spend a lot of time with your dog in. Often, aggression comes from stress or fear, and it may simply be a matter of de-stressing your pup’s life.\nThere’s hope for the overwhelming majority of dogs with a bite history, as many are able to improve their behavior with a combination of behavior modification and a sensible management plan for prevention. However, there is the rare dog whose likelihood of improvement is small because of a lack of any kind of self-control and the tendency to bite when frustrated, angry, and aroused.\nGive your dog some grace, and some care, and these are hopefully issues that never go beyond a warning growl.",

  "page_content": "Ever wanted to see and “smell” the world from your dog’s point of view? We talk with Alexandra Horowitz, a professor of psychology and canine cognition at Barnard College, Columbia University, who also leads the college’s Dog Cognition Lab, about her books on the study of dog behavior. Horowitz’s booksInside of a Dog: What Dogs See, SmellandBeing a Dog: Following the Dog Into a World of Smelluncover new insights into the inner lives of dogs and their external behaviors.This article comprises two interviews originally published in The Bark magazine in 2009 and 2016.\nThe dog’s amazing olfactory powers make their worldview different than ours. Can you explain why?\nAs we go about our day, we see the world first, using vision to help make sense of the sounds (conversation, sudden honking, a nearby thud) and the smells (something rancid or sweet wafting on the air) around us. Dogssmellthe world first, using olfaction to organize and make sense of what they see and hear. The richness of our visual world is matched, if not surpassed, by the richness of their olfactory world.This leads to some profound differences in the way the world looks, which I describe at length in the book. For instance, smells deteriorate over long distances, and are carried hither and thither by currents of air. The visual scene does not change with the breeze, and with distance, only looks “more distant.” The result is that the world is mapped differently for the creature who primarily “sees” it via his nose rather than his eyes.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nHas anyone studied why some dogs are better at smelling than others — is it genetic, or is it drive?\nEverything I’ve seen points to drive being the major indicator of whether a dog will be good as a detection dog: drive to find the odor, to keep working when frustrated, to get to the reward (like a game with a tug toy) at the episode’s end.\nThis is not to say that breed is irrelevant: some breeds are naturally more driven to pursue an odor relentlessly, or are driven to do whatever it takes to get a game of toss with a tennis ball. And some dogs — like Bloodhounds and Beagles — have more olfactory cells in their noses and more equipment around their faces (long ears, drooly jowls) to help bring odors up the nose. They may smell odors at lower levels.\nCuriously, though, the notion that certain breeds are inevitably better at detection work than others hasn’t been borne out. It’s tradition more than science.\nDo working dogs get nose fatigue — do they reach a point at which they can no longer reliably follow a scent? If so, what do the pros do to work around that?\nThe phenomenon of the nose no longer noticing an odor — adaptation — happens to us within minutes. Walk into a coffee shop, take in its familiar odors and a few minutes later, you might smell…almost nothing. The receptor cells in the nose that noticed the odor simply stopped responding after continued exposure.\nThe cells in the dog’s nose work similarly, but any dog employed as adetection dogis doing something different. Because they continue to sniff different areas of the odor “scene,” their noses won’t turn off to the smell. Tracking dogs are also known to simply lift their noses from the ground once in a while and sniff the air, as though to clear their noses.\nOn the other hand, working dogs certainly get fatigued from too much stimulation and too much exertion. Handlers know their dogs and will read their dogs’ responses to know when they need a break.\nIn the bookK9 Scent Trainingby Resi Gerritsen and Ruud Haak (leading specialists in identification, tracking and detection-dogs), I read that female dogs are better at smelling than males. Did this also come up in your research? Any idea if the same can be said for our species?\nGerritsen and Haak are great resources on detection-dog training and skills. I suspect their assessment comes directly from their own and other trainers’ experience with dogs. I don’t doubt it, though I don’t believe that the question has been formally tested. Interestingly, women are often said to be “better smellers” than men, and research does bear this out (on average, of course).\nIsAnimal Planetreally their favorite channel?\nYou note that dogs couldn’t really see TV in the pre-digital conversion days; the physiological reason behind this is significant — can you explain it?\nIt has to do with how we process light. Specialized cells in the eyes of mammals translate light waves into neural activity by changing the pigment in the cells. In the milliseconds that the pigment is changing, the cell can’t receive any more light. This leads to what is called the “flicker-fusion” rate: essentially, the number of snapshots of the world that the eyes can process each second. Our flicker-fusion rate is about 60 images per second.The image on old TVs and film is really a sequence of still shots sent quickly enough to fool our eyes into seeing a continuous stream. Given our flicker-fusion rate, the film needs to be only slightly faster than 60 still images a second to trick our eyes into seeing motion. Dogs, though, have a faster flicker-fusion rate — about 70 or 80 stills per second. When watching film, they can actually detect the individual frames as well as the dark spaces between them. With the recent conversion to entirely digital television broadcasts, though, the flicker-fusion rate is no longer relevant, since digital TV works differently. So, in theory,dogs can watch TV— though it still is not very olfactorily interesting!\nA lot of your research involves dog play. Why is play so important?\nPlay is a terrific venue in which to see dogs’ fast-paced, coordinated behavior; they are highly skilled players. As many dog owners may know, most bouts of play begin with a play signal, such as the familiar “play bow,” in which one dog bends down on his front legs, holding his rump high and his tail up and wagging. Another signal is the “exaggerated approach,” in which one dog lopes toward another dog, often with an extra-bouncy stride. These signals are considered requests to play, or announcements of an interest in playing. It appears to be important to play signal before starting to play, sinceplay involves behavior that would be considered aggressive— biting, mounting, bumping — in another context.\nWhen I looked at play sequences in very slow motion, what I was able to see was that dogs were very good at getting the attention of their hoped-for playmates before play signaling. And they seemed to know what kind of attention-getter would work in different situations: a more forceful attention-getter when the other dog is distracted, a mild one when the dog is standing idly. With humans, a person might need to shout to get the attention of someone talking to someone else; similarly, we don’t need to barge into someone standing right in front of us in order to get his attention. Dogs seem to know that. And then, only after getting the other dogs’ attention, did they signal an interest in playing.\nTwo animal behavior experts agree it’s usuallyplay fighting. Here’s how you can tell.\nDogs of the same “breed type,” like herders, seem to enjoy playing together and appear to have different styles of play than other breed types. For instance, they use the “eye,” and play “who winks first gets to be chased.” Have you studied behavioral traits in breeds and how they are expressed during play?\nI find it extremely interesting that breeds often gravitate to other members of their breed to play. Indeed, it seems that even similar-looking mixed-breeds often play together. Some of that could be explained by their owners’ interest in the familiar-looking or -acting dog (if owners loiter together, it gives the dogs more time to get acquainted). But most of it presumably comes from the dogs’ mutual recognition of characteristic behaviors in one another: the way the other dog solicits play, how he uses his tail and, as you suggest, even showing “eye” or other breed-typical behaviors. My own research did not control for breed, and I don’t know of any other studies that have specifically identified whether or not certain behaviors are more likely during play among members of one breed than play among members of another. It’s ripe for the investigating!\nIt was interesting that you said that long-time or close playmates can exchange shorthand signals with each other. How can we learn to read our dog’s shorthand?\nThe shorthand is usually a component of the play signal. Theplay bowinvolves bringing the forelegs down and the rump up — so, a shorthand version of that is what I call a “play slap”: just bending down on the front legs, usually with an audible slap. Similarly, many signals involve an open, almost grinning-looking mouth; as shorthand, a dog can do a very short open-mouth display with another dog. If you know the components of the signals, you can see how dogs break them up to use with their regular playmates.\nHow can you tell if your dog feels or is expressing guilt?\nIt is an open question whether dogs feel guilt, one that we all have our hunches about but that is very hard to confirm empirically. I recently published a study testing whether the “guilty look” that dogs show —ears back, tail down, slinking off or avoiding eye contact — actually indicates that the dog has disobeyed and possibly feels guilty. I found that dogs showed the most guilty looknotwhen they had actually disobeyed, but rather, when they were scolded or confronted by a suspicious owner, even if they had done nothing wrong.What most dogs do seem to know is that some actions — those that have provoked punishment in the past — are “wrong,” off-limits or at least likely to provoke punishment again. This is not the same as feeling guilt. They may do the guilty look as an entreaty not to be punished.\nHow to get your pet to stop chewing on inedibles from clothes to couches.\nHow can you tell if your dog is bored? I know that is one of the biggest concerns of pet parents.\nBoredom in dogs looks remarkably similar, in broad strokes, to what it looks like in humans: flagging energy, reduced activity, poor attention, sleeping too much. Dogs may pace (similar to zoo animals kept in too-small enclosures with nothing to engage them) or do repetitive actions, such as licking orchewing themselves obsessively. If you come home to find your house in disarray, socks mauled, pillows disemboweled, it’s likely that your dog was bored — at least until he found those socks and pillows with which to occupy his time. Boredom can be sated by giving the dog something to do: play with him, give him plenty of social time with other dogs, or hide safe toys or treats for him to find when you’re away.\nYou said that “in many ways, dogs act as if they think about their memories as the personal story of their life.” What do you mean by this?\nIt is an intriguing question whether dogs think about themselves — that is, whether they have a sense of their own life story, their autobiography. It is also a very difficult question to address scientifically. I am proposing, however, that much of dogs’ behavior, such as what they remember — where they buried that bone last summer, the dog who was hostile the last time they met, a shortcut home — indicates that they are, in fact, thinking about their life in an autobiographical way.\nBesides enrolling our dogs in nosework classes, what do you recommend that pet parents do to tap into their world of smell and enrich their lives?\nLet them smell. If you live with a dog, start thinking about what the world is like from an olfactory point of view. Let them smell you (you are your scent, to your dog), let them smell each other (that’s how they find out who it is), and let them smell the world. Takewalks for smelling(not just for peeing, or for exercise). The pleasure that comes from watching a dog snuffling down a path, nose to the ground and nose in the air, guided by nothing more than the filaments of odors that come his way, is to me unmatched.",
