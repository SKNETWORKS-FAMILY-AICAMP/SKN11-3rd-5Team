  "page_content": "Most dogs don’t love it when we leave them home alone. We get it; we don’t like to be away from them, either. It’s annoying to leave our best friends for mundane and unimportant things like jobs, errands, a social life. However, disliking watching their pet parents leave the house and actually panicking about it are two different things.\nA few simple things help most dogs become comfy: exercise, food-puzzle toys, and a comfortable spot to rest until we get back. Assisting dogs with separation anxiety is a serious challenge, but you and your pup can overcome it. First thing’s first: myth-busting. There are several pervasive myths about treating separation anxiety, and clearing them up makes it more likely that dogs will get the effective treatment they need and deserve to be happy and well.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nYou must confine your dog to a crate or small room when you are gone.\nIf your dog is chewing on anything and everything when you are gone, peeing, pooping, and droolingon your carpets, and generally making a giant mess of your house every time you leave, the idea of confining your dog is tempting (oh, so tempting!). However, doing this when you are gone does nothing to ease the panic they feel about being alone.\nAt best, all confinement does is keep the mess to a smaller area, while doing nothing to alleviate your dog’s fear of the situation. It may also teach your dog to beterrified of the cratethey used to be happy to settle down in when people are home. It can even lead to injuries for dogs who are desperate to escape the crate to try to find you.\nIt’s essential to leave your dog with a stuffed Kong or a similar food toy.\nShockingly, leaving your pup with astuffed Kongis far less effective when treating separation anxiety than using desensitization methods. In other words, you need toget your dog usedto all your “leaving” cues, such as putting on your shoes, picking up your keys, or touching the doorknob. That is much more effective than giving them special toys or treats when you leave them alone.\nGiving your dog a treat or toy they love as you leave just adds to the routine of you leaving and is one more signal to them that you’re heading out. Also, many dogs in this scenario are too upset to eat, and even those who do will sometimes finish the food and then panic when it is gone.\nGetting more exercise will fix it.\nExercise is generally helpful for dogs’ wellbeing, and I’m all for adding more of it to your dog’s daily life.Exercise is enjoyablefor dogs, it’s good for their health, and helps many dogs sleep better, which, in turn, makes them feel better. Exercise will enhance their life no matter what.\nWhat it willnotdo, though, is serve as a treatment for separation anxiety. Exercise ismagic up to a point(and necessary to keep your pup healthy), but it cannot cure anything and everything. Trying to fix separation anxiety by giving your dog more exercise is much like trying to cure yourself of a fear of heights or a fear of spiders by going running every day. It’s a beautiful idea, but it’s a myth rather than a real solution.\nOnly use medication if nothing else works.\nYour vet can help you decidewhether to use medicationto help treat your pup’s separation anxiety.  As a behaviorist and trainer, medication is out of my area of expertise, but I can share the basics.\nA benefit of using medication is that it makes dogs better able to learn. That means they respond more effectively and more quickly to efforts to teach them to handle being left alone. It’s not a last-resort strategy — it’s part of a multi-pronged approach for helping them cope with being left alone. If medication is appropriate for a dog, based on a veterinarian’s medical opinion, it can have a huge positive impact on the progress of the behavior modification. Consider consulting with your veterinarian about medication now as a part of your efforts to help your dog. Don’t wait until it feels like a last-ditch effort.\nOnly the dog’s pet parent can calm them down.\nThere is a common belief that a dog with separation anxiety will become upset and panicky if they are away from their pet parent. In most cases, dogs with separation anxiety are fine whensomeoneis there with them, even if it is not their person. They only become distressed if they are alone, rather than if they are away from their family.\nThat makes the logistics of treating separation anxiety easier because you don’t have to be with your dog constantly, though you do have to make sure someone is with your dog at all times. It’s still hard, but with a community of support, it can be done, and far more easily than if you had to be the one with your dog 24/7. Being with your dog every minute of every day sounds amazing in theory, but in practice, it’s hard on your lifestyle. We all need a little space sometimes, ya know?\nSeparation anxiety is your fault.\nIt’s easy to criticize and assume people are doing something wrong if their dog flips out when they’re alone. This is completely false. I suspect many people like to thinktheycould never end up with a dog with separation anxiety because this is only a problem for people who have made mistakes.False.\nBlaming people for their dog’s struggles is misplaced and unkind. Isn’t the world harsh enough without accusing people of causing problems that aren’t their fault? Any number of reasons — breed tendencies, instinct, a natural stress response, etc. — can cause this issue. It doesn’t mean pet parents did anything wrong.\nReferences\nDeMartini-Price, Malena.Separation Anxiety in Dogs: Next Generation Treatment Protocols for Fearing and Phobic Dogs.

  "page_content": "I vividly remember my dog Grendel’s worst episode of toy-aggression. A friend and I had planned to go snowshoeing with our baby daughters on our backs. My friend arrived and let her dog, Monty, out of her car before I had a chance to remove Grendel’s tennis ball from the yard. Monty went for the ball, and Grendel went for Monty. We couldn’t break up the fight because of our babies and resorted to shouting until the dogs separated, leaving blood on the snow behind them.\nThis is an extreme example of toy-aggression, also known asresource guarding. Paige Gordon, a certified professional dog trainer atSpiritDog Training, defines it as protective behavior towards a possession or a resource a dog is afraid of losing. It’s behavior that originates in their instinct of perceived threat. “If your dog is exhibiting the signs of resource guarding or aggression around their toys, this is something that generally needs to be addressed immediately, as it is a behavior that can escalate and become a safety concern quickly,” Gordon says.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents.

Signs of toy-aggression may includegrowling and other body languagethat sends warning signals.Reactivityto an unwelcome advance may turn to aggression, like Grendel’s attack on Monty. “Dogs will display space-making behaviors, such as snarling or growling, giving the other dog or approaching person a chance to walk away safely,” Ryan says.\nToy-aggression is different than the behavior your dog exhibits when they’reripping up toys(which is aggressive, but only towards the toy — not you or another dog). It’s also different than the behavior your dog exhibits whenthey want to play(an open, grinning mouth, wagging tail, and enthusiastic play bow).\nGordon explains that dogs understand what’s currently in their possession as “theirs” and generally develop toy-aggression out of fear of losing an object they value. Some dogs may value one toy more than others, such as a ball. “They don’t understand that if someone were to take the toy they’re playing with, they have a whole bin of toys off to the side,” Gordon says. If you notice your dog becoming attached to a particular toy, try introducing them to one they haven’t used in a while fora game of tug or fetch.\nRyan says dogs assign value to toys on a changing basis. “A toy that the dog guards one day might not be as exciting the next day, or maybe it takes their dog sibling or friend playing with it to remind them how exciting it can be.”\nGordon says dogs with a high toy drive are more likely to exhibit resource guarding and toy-aggression. It’s similar to human impulses around certain items, Ryan says. “In the moment, they want it and don’t want to give it up,” he says.\nPlaying keep away or hiding their toys, growling when you approach to take their toy, and refusing to give up a toy are sure signs of toy-aggression. Other signs are snapping, hunching over toys, and getting tense or freezing, Gordon says. “One sign is taking the toy and running into another room to avoid being bothered,” Ryan says. “When you approach, they may stop playing and stare at you.”\nToy-aggression is normal behavior, Ryan says. It’s cause for concern, Gordon explains, when it escalates and becomes a safety risk. “Like, if your dog gets to the point where they may bite if you try to take away the toy,” she says.\nAs soon as you notice your dog guarding a toy, take action. Begin limiting access to prized items and teach the “drop it” cue, Gordon advises. Ryan concurs. “We want to manage the situation around kids, unfamiliar people, and other dogs, and teach the dog a solid ‘leave it,’ or ‘drop,’ or ‘trade’ cue for when we need an item,” he says.\nTurns out, even experts have a hard time defining these terms.\nStep-by-step training guide for toy-aggression\n“Counterconditioning” is the technical term for the method of teaching your dog to associate something they like, such as treats, with you taking something they’re guarding. “Desensitization” is the term for getting your dog used to your approach when they’re engaged with something they value. The more you practice counterconditioning, the more desensitized your dog becomes to you reaching for and taking their toy.\nStep 1:Start by standing far enough away to avoid prompting a reaction from your dog, and toss high-quality treats to them. The goal is to associate your presence with something they enjoy as much as the object they’re guarding, and begin to develop a positive emotional response to your approach.\nStep 2:Step closer, expecting your dog to begin demonstrating aggressive behavior. Back away and approach again, continuing to toss treats. Work at each level of intensity until your dog is comfortable, then progress to the next level. The goal is to be able to approach your dog and take their toy. This may take days, weeks, or months, depending on the intensity of the toy-aggression.\nStep 3:Ultimately, you should be able to approach your dog, take their toy, and give it back without a display of aggression. Practice doing this regularly to prevent toy-aggression.\nExperts agree: breed doesn’t have anything to do with it.\nHow to prevent toy-aggression in dogs\nResource guarding may have a genetic component that’s hard to avoid, Gordon says, but every dog benefits from a well-trained and practiced ‘drop it’ cue. She says don’t ever forcefully pull a toy out of a dog’s mouth, and always try to prevent other dogs in the house from stealing each other’s toys.\nWhen to call a professional to help with toy-aggression\n“If your dog is escalating the resource guarding to the point where they seem like they may bite or are trying to bite, you should call in a trainer who specializes in resource guarding and aggression,” Gordon says.\nBottom line\nToy-aggression is normal behavior for dogs of any breed.\nToy-aggression is normal behavior for dogs of any breed.\nUntreated, it becomes dangerous.\nUntreated, it becomes dangerous.\nLack of training around toy-aggression, and not a dog’s breed, contributes to this aggression.\nLack of training around toy-aggression, and not a dog’s breed, contributes to this aggression.\nFAQs\nResource guarding is defined as protective behavior towards a possession or a resource that a dog is afraid of losing. Signs include hiding toys, playing keep away, hunching over a toy, tensing up, growling, and snapping when they perceive a person or another dog threatening their toy.\nAs soon as you notice toy-aggression, limit access to toys, train (or reinforce) the“drop it,” “leave it”or“trade”cue. Also, begin desensitizing your dog to your approach when they have a toy.\nTo prevent dogs, especially in multi-dog households, from taking each other’s toys, limit access to coveted toys (like apeanut butter-stuffed Kong) and create designated times for each dog to enjoy the toy. Or separate spaces if you have identical toys.",

    "title": "Why Do Dogs Always Take Up the Entire Bed When They Sleep With You?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/why-do-dogs-take-up-whole-bed-sleeping"
  },
  "page_content": "As dog parents, we spend a lot of time talking about training — ways to gently convince our precious pooches tocome when we call, not topee inside the house,and to sit quietly while waiting for a treat (or five). But what about the ways that they trainus? For instance: I used to be a person who sprawled out all over the bed while sleeping. But now that I share it with two small dogs? Let’s just say that fully extending my legs is a privilege I rarely enjoy.\nI call this phenomenon “dog-spreading.” For whatever reason, some dogs don’t just like to sleep in the bed — they defy the laws of physics by expanding to twice or thrice their normal size, stretching their limbs and turning into dead weight that refuses to be moved. After midnight, I swear my 25-pound dog turns into a boulder, plastering herself against my thigh and cornering me in what feels like two square inches of mattress space until dawn mercifully breaks. How does she do it?Whydoes she do it? These are questions that do not concern her, because she’s already asleep. But still, as I lay awake at night wondering what this might do to my joints after a few years, I knew I needed to get some facts.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nThe short answer, of course, is that dogs are a lot like people and all have theirindividual sleeping preferences. “Some like to curl up into a cozy little ball, while others prefer to sprawl out like a starfish,” says Dr. Brian Hare, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University and author ofPuppy Kindergarten. “Some want to lean into your warmth, while others are champion kickers — it really depends on the dog’s personality.”\nIn other words, as veterinarian Dr. Betsy Challen, certified dog and cat behaviorist and owner ofPawsitive Animal Careput it, “Once you invite a dog into your bed, you never know what you are going to get.” That said, you don’t have to lie helpless in the dark. If your dog’s sleepy-time antics are driving you barking mad, you have some options.\nWhy do dogs take over the whole bed?\nThe longer answer is that we kind of brought this on ourselves. Historically, both Challen and Hare point out, dogs were not often found in human beds. Before the 1980s and 90s, Hare says, “sharing a bed with your dog often meant waking up with fleas or ticks.” But in the 20-plus years Challen has worked as a veterinarian, she’s watched dogs move into the house after decades of sleeping Snoopy-style in backyard dog houses. Now, she says, many have their own beds and playtime set-ups.\n“So, to many dog owners, dogs are like children,” Challen says. “And in this way, [pet parents] naturally have the inclination to have their dogs, often starting at the age of a puppy, sleep in their beds.” Obviously, Hare notes, the rise of preventatives has made nighttime cuddling a lot more appealing as well.\nAs natural pack animals, Challen says, dogs are used to sleeping together in dens, so sharing our beds is usually a no-brainer. At the same time, as many of us have noticed while waking up with our best buds’ rumps in our faces, “they don’t alwaysmake the best bed-mates.”\nWhy is your dog burrowing under the blankets?\nWhile some doggos like to hermetically seal us into a small spot by pinning us under the covers, others prefer to snuggle up beneath the sheets. According to Hare,burrowing is usually completely normal— “unless it’s paired with signs of anxiety or distress.”\nMore often than not, dogs who like burying themselves in cotton are natural burrowers to begin with, Challen says.\nOne such breed, according to dog trainerAnthony Sorosky, is the Daschund. “They are almost always preferring to be under the covers, often all the way down to your feet,” he says. “These dogs are wired genetically to pursue their prey down into the ground. Hence theshape of their body. They are quite good at it, too. Imagine if your job was to chase a badger down a hole and pull it out by its toes. You would have to be pretty comfortable in tight spaces. You may actually feel more comfortable in tighter spaces and prefer them.”\nIs it OK to try to move your dog while they’re asleep?\nMy dogs might not appreciate this answer, but yes, if your dog’s chosen sleep spot is standing between you and some precious ZZZ’s, it’s totally fine to wake them up or gently coax them into another spot. “Just gently nudge them over — unless they’re elderly, in pain, or have a history of aggression,” Hare says. “Otherwise, they’ll probably just reposition and fall right back asleep.”\nIt’s natural to feel hesitant, especially given that old saying about “letting sleeping dogs lie.” But for those who find themselves reluctant, Challen offers a little pep talk.\n“When it comes to dogs and pets in general I often think, whose house and bed is this anyway?” Challen says. “The dog usually has its own bed and has chosen to sleep in ‘your’ bed or has been invited into your bed by you. If your dog is waking you up throughout the night and making you sleep in an uncomfortable manner then I think it is completely fine to remove your dog from your bed. After all, your dog doesn’t have a job to go to in the morning, a test to take… you get the idea. Let the dog know when he is welcomed in your bed, but also when he is not.”\nAnd if your dog chooses not to play nice and refuses to leave the bed? “It may be time to take a good look at the relationship you have with your dog,” Challen says. Sorosky agrees: “Look around, and you will probably find a few other places where the dog is getting his [or] her way at your expense.”\nWhat should you do if your dog growls when you try to move them?\nAs tempting as it might be, don’t ignore the behavior. Instead, Challen says, “I would immediately assess the situation and get the dog off the bed.”\nAlittle growlmight seem innocuous. But Challen has seen many situations in which pet parents did not intervene and then saw the behavior escalate — especially when new people like friends, new romantic partners, or children enter the bed.\n“I have had to counsel many owners on what to do in this situation, and proactivity is the key,” Challen says. “If your dog is growling when touched or moved and is left to continue in this manner, it can lead to aggression.”\nIf you’re concerned about your dog’s growling, Sorosky suggests using a leash at night. If your dog growls, do not let them stay on the bed. Use the leash to remove them from the bed without reaching for their collar. “Sometimes, if your dog starts to realize that it is his own behavior that can get him an invitation onto the bed or get him sent off, he’s likely to make a change,” Sorosky says.\nIs it wrong to banish your dog from the bed after letting them sleep in it?\nNope! As Hare points out, “Dogs are incredibly adaptable — it may take a bit of time and consistency, but they can absolutely learn a new routine.”\nIn some cases, your dog might already have their own safe place, like a bed ora crate.These spots can come in handy when guests or children are around, Challen says, in case your dog needs a place to settle down. If your dog already feels comfortable in their own bed, you should feel no qualms about sending them there at night.\n“You will find after a while that your dog may prefer to sleep here not only overnight but during the day, when there are [storms] or when he is feeling like he wants to be left alone,” Challen says. “One of my clients missed his special cuddle time with his dog before bed, but no longer wanted his dog sleeping on the bed with him. He was willing to go cuddle his dog on his dog’s bed, in his safe space, prior to going to bed for the night. This was a win-win situation after both parties got used to it.”\nIf you’re starting from scratch, Challen says basic cues like “up” and “off” can teach your dog which places are suitable for sleep and which are not. Hare also suggests making your dog’s new nighttime digs “as positive and rewarding as possible.” Make sure the spot feels safe and cozy, and try feeding your dog meals and treats there to create happy associations. “Also,” Hare says, “a nice long walk before bedtime helps — if they’re tired out, they’ll settle in more easily.”\nAt the end of the day, Sorosky says, “dogs are more flexible than we may think.” So, if you’re losing sleep to a pooch who insists on taking up the entire real estate of the bed, trust in your bond and find an arrangement that works for both of you.",

    "title": "Why Do Dogs Bury Bones?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/why-do-dogs-bury-bones"
  },
  "page_content": "Every time my dog, Lilac, gets a new bone, she buries it right away. Watching her dig a hole is almost worth the money I spent on the bone itself. She carefully places the bone inside the hole, nudging the dirt over it with her nose. She does all this with an air of solemnity, mostly in the soft soil around the base of plants. If it’s cold, she’ll dig a shallow hole in the decomposing brown leaves at the edge of the woods and cover the bone with leaves. Months later, she retrieves the partially decomposed prize.\nVeterinarian Dr. Marc Smith, owner ofNatchez Trace Veterinary Services, says dogs are highly instinctual creatures, despite centuries of domestication and their reliance on us. Their close relatives, wolves, often bury their food to protect it from scavengers.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\n“Your dog might bury its bones based off genetically instinctual behaviors,” Smith says. “Although your dog probably does not have scavengers looking to steal its precious bone, this instinct still lies within them.”\nThe bone in question might instead be a treat, a toy or coveted chew. Kinship has aguide to the safest options(spoiler alert: it’s pig ears and bully sticks). There’s also advice aboutwhat types of bones are safe for puppiesand why it’snever safe for dogs of any age to have rib bones.\nWhy do dogs bury bones?\nDr. Aimee Warner, resident veterinarian atWaggel, says a dog’s instinct to bury bones is a behavioral tendency inherited from their wild ancestors. “Wild canines used to cache food for future consumption, particularly when food was not always available,” Warner says, adding the urge remains particularly strong in hunting and guard dogs. “It’s a survival mechanism for them. Some still do it now, even in the house — by ‘digging’ on the carpet or pushing imaginary dirt onto a toy or treat. It’s such a great demonstration of instinct.”\nResource guardingis definedas your dog’s protective behavior toward food or a toy it fears another animal might steal. My first dog, Grendel, would attack other dogs for approaching her toy or take another dog’s toy and growl at them if they tried to get it back. “Resource guarding can happen in many different ways, sometimes burying bones and sometimes even in the form of aggression,” Smith says. “If your dog is burying their bones as a form of resource guarding, your dog is trying to hide its bone [to keep it] from being stolen.”\nDigging and hiding are stimulating, sensory behaviors that entertain dogs, Warner says. Garden soil, couches and clothes baskets are ripe for exploring. Digging a large hole in the garden is one of many things dogs do for entertainment, Smith says. “Sometimes dogs will bury their bones to stimulate themselves,” he says. “This could be due to thembeing boredand not having a good source to put their energy into.”\nWarner explains that digging can be a symptom ofanxiety and stress, like boredom. “Burying is an anxiety/stress-relieving mechanism in some canines, particularly under routine or situational stress,” she says.\nTerriers and Dachshunds are among the dogs bred to hunt underground animals like gophers who were threatening farmers’ crops. They’re so good at digging that the American Kennel Club (AKC)developed Earthdog, a simulated sport for underground hunting dogs. In the absence of activity that speaks to their deepest instincts, dogs will dig vigorously in soft, yielding soil or bedding to soothe themselves. “Sometimes, dogs just need a sense of security to make them relax,’ Smith says.\nThe historical roots of burying behavior\nUnderstanding the roots of your dog’s behavior can help you appreciate their connection to history.\nImagine a hole in the ground as a refrigerator for your dog’s ancestors. Like us, your dog’s wolfish forbearers appreciated a consistent food supply. Within canine evolutionary history, burying is a wolf’s deeply rooted solution to a persistent problem.\n“Burying their excess food allows them to have food whenever they need it,” Smith explains. “They also live in the wild, thus leaving food out and about will attract all sorts of scavengers to come and steal their excess food.”\nShould you let your dog bury bones?\nIf your pup’s digging is sporadic and doesn’t damage your yard or home, it’s generally harmless, Warner says. “If your dog is having some small bury-and-dig nirvana and is not ruining furniture, soiling beds or being overly possessive, then it’s fine,” she says.\nSmith agrees and says it depends on your tolerance. “Generally, the only reason to stop this behavior is if it is harmful to you,” he says. He cautions that digging can lead to more destructive behaviors. “For example, this urge to dig in the yard could suddenly turn into an urge to dig a hole in your couch,” he says.\nHow to stop your dog from burying bones\nA tired dog doesn’t have the energy to dig. Warner advises making sure your dog is well-exercised mentally and physically. If burying bones is a form of mental stimulation, Smith suggests trying a toy that was made to stimulate digging behavior. These snuffle mats could be a great option to curb your dog's destructive behavior while still giving their energy an outlet, he says.\nObserve what items your dog likes to bury. My dogs, for example will bury bones and chews but not treats and toys. “Sometimes the best way to eliminate a problem is to start at the root of the problem,” Smith says. “If your dog is only digging around their bones, removing the bones does not give the dog a chance to exhibit that behavior.”\nSometimes digging is the symptom of abundant energy that can find another outlet. Give your dog an engaging chew or toy. Smith mentions toys that are designed to stimulate a dog’s desire to dig. “These dig mats can be filled with treats making the dog want to dig and helping to get out that desire,” he says.\nDogs are infamous diggers, bones or not. I still find (and narrowly avoid) holes my dogs dig looking for mice in the fields around our house.Training your dog not to digis possible if you’d rather not twist your ankle walking through your own yard. Warner suggests providing them with a sandbox or garden bed to place objects and bury. If encouraged, they’ll likely return to that area. “If your dog is having a hard time curbing the urge to dig, sometimes a compromise is a great choice,” Smith says. “By redirecting this behavior to one specific location, it can be easier to control and manage.”\nIf the behavior seems obsessive, is destructive or impossible to redirect, Smith advises meeting with a veterinarian or behaviorist to unearth (no pun intended) the cause. “The best way to deter the behavior is to first discover why your pet does this,” he says. “If you can discover the why, you can then figure out how to stimulate your dog in a way that deters the digging behavior.”\nFAQs\nDog bury bones and toys out of instinct to protect or save those items for (in their minds) times of scarcity. Their first instinct might be to dig outdoors but, failing that, the pillows and blankets on your bed are soft, yielding and familiar.\nNo, not if you don’t mind your dog digging a hole to bury the bone. Much of canine behavior that mystifies us comes from deeply instinctual places. Some dogs were bred to dig (think terriers) and it’s in their genes.\nSome are more likely to dig than others. Terriers, Dachshunds, Beagles, Schnauzers, and Border Collies are among the high-energy working dogs bred to dig for small animals. Huskies dig to keep themselves cool.\nStrategies include limiting access to bones, fencing off favorite excavation areas, redirecting the behavior or creating a designated digging area.\nReferences\n“Why do dogs bury bones?” SPCA New Zealand, Dr. Jess Beer,https://www.spca.nz/advice-and-welfare/article/why-do-dogs-bury-bones",

  },
  "page_content": "We all have our vices, and dogs are no different. Some treat the trash can like their own personal buffet. Others love living up to stereotypes by gobbling down textbooks and homework. And then, there are the true freaks of the canine kingdom — the naughty pups whomunch on dirty clothes like socksand underwear.\nMake no mistake: We’re not here to literally yuck anyone’s yum, especially when that someone is your beloved dog. In fact, experts say that chewing on clothing is a pretty common, if not entirely productive, fixation. Sometimes, it’s boredom. Sometimes, it’s because they want to interact with something that smells like their favorite person.Aw.And sometimes, it’s pure animal instinct.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nWe asked two experts — Amy Learn, board-certified veterinary behaviorist and certified animal behavior consultant  and Jenny Dagnino, behavior and training manager for theArizona Humane Society— to give us the dirt on this grimy habit, and how best to handle it in your pet.\nSo, why do dogs chew on clothes?\nBecause they’re bored or anxious\nYou might not think much about your laundry, but for a dog, that pile of filthy clothes might be as intriguing as the season 3 finale ofThe White Lotus.“Clothes are interesting,” Dagnino says. “Especially clothes that have been worn. Clothes that smell like you. Stinky clothes. Dogs love stinky things — the stinkier, the more attractive.”\nSweaty socks, dirty underwear, bras hung on the doorknob, and leggings you just wore to the gym are all fair game, as far as an untrained dog is concerned. And if your pooch isdealing with anxiety, all that chomping could be a coping mechanism.\n“Dogs chew on lots of things,” Learn says. “Chewing is a self-soothing behavior that allows them to decompress when they are overwhelmed. Some dogs choose hard items [like] sticks and bones, while others choose softer things to rip apart. Others chew or suck on soft items in a compulsive way due to life or environmental stress.”\nBecause they love us\nIn some cases, Learn says, dogs will specifically seek out clothing items that smell like their humans “because they are interesting.” Dagnino likens this impulse to a familiar line from the children’s bookWhere the Wild Things Are: “Oh please don’t go — we’ll eat you up —we love youso!”\nThe impulse can be incredibly strong, especially when your clothes’ stench rises to the same level as your dog’s passion. Dagnino recalls her sister’s husband, who was a line cook, and her Daschund, who always eagerly stole his socks when he came home from a long day of work.\n“It must have been disgusting, but she wanted that sock as soon as he got home,” Dagnino says. “I think dogs will often chew things that smell like their favorite people.”\nBecause they’re dogs\nAs fun (and, sometimes, important) as it is to armchair psychologize our pets, there is one other reason your dog might be endlessly fixated on your laundry pile: Dogs are hardwired to chew, and unless we teach themwhatto chew, they might be drawn to just about anything. That’s why chewing laundry can be particularly common among younger dogs and dogs who have not been trained to nibble on sanctioned items only.\n“It’s just a behavior that's kind of built in,” Dagnino says. “It’s their software.”\nWhat should you do if your dog likes to chew on clothes?\nYou know that Benjamin Franklin quote about an ounce of prevention being worth a pound of cure? That’s definitely true here. If your dog can’t stop chewing holes in your favorite clothes, your first step toward happiness and harmony is to cut them off at the source. As Dagnino puts it, “You’ve got to get that stuff out of reach.”\nYouknow the drill: Close the necessary doors. Keep your clothes off the floor. Use baby gates, lidded hampers, and all other tools at your disposal to keep your funky socks out of reach. Once you’ve ensured that your dog can’t get to the wrong “chew toys,” you can focus on helping them find therightones. Learn suggests using chew toys, exercise, attention, and play tokeep your dog satisfied.\n“When a dog has something it should not, trade for a treat, and then offer an appropriate chew item instead,” Learn says. “If thedog guardsor becomes aggressive, seek help from a veterinary professional or a positive reinforcement trainer.” Punishment, she says, is not an appropriate training tool.\nBut one more thing about those chew toys. Per Dagnino, it’s not enough to drop a heap of stuffed animals and squeakers on the floor and hope for the best. You need to pay attention to your dog and find out which toys they actually like — and, in some cases, to help them learn to like them.\nSome dogs willgravitate toward certain toysright away — fromthe squeakers, to the ropes, to the cuddly stuffies. Others might be apathetic at first. In those cases, Dagnino suggests sitting down and trying to engage them in play.\nIf you have a rope toy on hand, try dipping it in low-sodium broth and freezing it for extra appeal. You might also try toys that you canstuff with goodieslike peanut butter and treats. Whenever your dog chews on a sanctioned item, act excited and give them the praise they deserve. And to keep toys feeling fresh and novel, get a rotation going, keeping only a few out at a time.\nWhen should you take them to a vet?\nChewing might be the gateway to eating, but according to both Dagnino and Learn, these behaviors often have different causes. If your dog is actually swallowing your dirty drawers, it’s probably time to call a vet. In some cases, Learn says, chewing and swallowing clothing can be more than a behavioral issue; your dog might eat clothing because of underlying gastrointestinal discomfort. In some cases, Learn says, they might need a special diet or treatment protocol to feel better.\nIf your dog has eaten something and you’re worried they might have an intestinal obstruction or othergastrointestinal issues, Learn suggests watching for telltale signs, which can include decreased appetite, not eating,vomiting or retching, diarrhea, and constipation.\nAnd even if your dog seems fine, eating clothing is still cause for concern and should not be ignored. “Eating non-food items can become acompulsive behaviorcalled pica if left untreated,” Learn says. “It should be addressed early on.”\nIt can be tempting to try and deal with these problems alone, but in this case, it’s best not to bite off more than you can, uh, chew. If your dog is actually eating clothes or other non-food items, schedule a full examination and work-up with your veterinarian and come up with a plan to shift their eating habits. Your dog’s digestive system will surely thank you.",

  "page_content": "Most dog parents would say their pet has a personality, even a sense of humor. Once, while playing with my dog, I told her to go get her toy, and she returned to me with a live spider in her mouth. This left me with two questions: Is my dog funnier than me? Also, is my dogmessing with me on purpose?\nWhile the jury is still out on the former — though many signs point to “yes” — it isn’t uncommon for dogs to give us mixed signals, especially ones you could swear were intentional:\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nJumping out of the bathjustbefore you’ve finished fully rinsing the soap out\nJumping out of the bathjustbefore you’ve finished fully rinsing the soap out\nBegging to go outside only to immediately beg to be let back in\nBegging to go outside only to immediately beg to be let back in\nTaking your slipper and gleefully prancing around the house with it\nTaking your slipper and gleefully prancing around the house with it\nPawing to be pet, then acting stand-offish when given attention\nPawing to be pet, then acting stand-offish when given attention\nWaiting until you’ve finally finished putting on all their outdoor gear to kick off their booties in one fell swoop\nWaiting until you’ve finally finished putting on all their outdoor gear to kick off their booties in one fell swoop\nHearing “What do you have in your mouth?” as a sign to chew faster and then promptly swallow\nHearing “What do you have in your mouth?” as a sign to chew faster and then promptly swallow\nAnd oh, this one: making sure their butt is positioned just in front of your face before letting one rip\nAnd oh, this one: making sure their butt is positioned just in front of your face before letting one rip\nIf you’ve experienced what can only be described as “trolling” behavior, welcome. Fortunately, I spoke with a couple of experts about why your dog is messing with you — and what to do about it.\nWait, do dogs have a sense of humor?\nRats are known to laugh when tickledandapes will playfully tease one another, but does your dog understand when they’re being funny (especially at your expense)? While there is research to suggest thatsome animals may have evolved a sense of humor, it’s more likely that your dog isengaging in playrather than trying to pull a fast one on you.\nFor example, you’ve probably seen your dog give a “play bow,” with their front paws on the ground and their rear in the air. Margaret H.B., an educator at a Midwest animal shelter, says this is the best indicator that your dog is feeling playful. “Often they’ll be holding a ball or toy to make it incredibly clear they want to run, play, wrestle, etc.” she says, adding that dogs will play bow to people and other pets alike. In other words, if it seems like your dog is teasing you, they’re probablyjust trying to play. (As for the fart example, that’s just unfortunate timing.)\nDoes my dog associate “teasing” with play?\nThink about how you typically play with your dog. Is there a lot of keep-away? Fake-outs? Pretending to throw something and hiding it behind your back? Is this not you trolling your dog? When humans and dogs play together, both will typically engage in behaviors that are best categorized as “playful teasing.”\nIn fact, dogs will often signal that they are playing when the game at hand is particularly frustrating. As a 2024study on human-dog playfound, “play bows appeared to be integral to dogs’ play activities, usually when the dog was playing object-keepaway andtug o’ war, or the dog was reacting to the human engaging in frustration games like object-keepaway or fakeout.” Put another way, your dog might associate light frustration with fun.\nWhat if my dog is giving me mixed signals?\n“Sometimes, interpreting a dog’s behavior can be confusing,” admits Dr. Valli Parthasarathy, who is a co-owner of and Veterinary Behavior Specialist atSynergy Veterinary Behaviorin Portland, Oregon. She recommends paying attention to your dog’sentirebody languagewhen trying to understand their behavior — is theirtail waggingwhile they let out a low growl? Are their ears back (whichcould mean anxiety) when they are playing a confusing game of keepaway with their favorite ball?\nDr. Parthasarathy also says to remember context here: “Is there a pattern to when it happens? Could it be that they are trying to get your attention to do something [else]?” If your dog’s confusing bids for attention persist and accompany signs of discomfort (like growling), it could be a sign that your dog is physically uncomfortable. In this case, Dr. Parthasarathy recommends reaching out to your vet to check for anypossible medical conditions.\nHow can I get my dog to stop trolling me?\nTo generalize a bit, pet parents aren’t mad about this behavior. On the whole, we love our little babies no matter what they do, and to be honest, we probably love them morebecauseof their hijinks. But if they are truly are getting on your nerves, there are some things you can do.\nWhileyoumay be able to contextualize your dog’s behavior,theirunderstanding of context is much more limited. For them, keepaway is fun, regardless of whether it’s you with a tennis ball or them with your slipper. One solution? Both experts recommend familiarizing yourself with your dog’s specific behavior, particularly usingtraining classes.\n“Not only is training fun for your dog and strengthens the bond between you two, but it’s also an amazing opportunity to learn from an expert about what your dog is trying to tell you with their body language,” Margaret H.B. says. She advises checking your local shelter’s available training classes and keep an eye out for ones that focus onpositive reinforcement.\nIf nothing else, you can alway post videos of your dog messing with you with hopes of going viral. One pet parent’s temporary misery is the internet’s treasure.",

  },
  "page_content": "It’s super common for people to hope their dogs will just grow out of their problematic behavior, likebarking at every dogin the neighborhood, chasing the cat, or biting strangers. That’s not usually the case, but there are a few common behavior issues that most dogs will outgrow —thankfully— especially if we give them just the right guidance. Here’s a look at the behaviors you can expect your dog to outgrow with time, patience, and a little help.\nSubmissive urination\nDoes your puppypee when people greet them, or even when other dogs say hi? Maybe they do it when they hear a loud noise or are surprised in any way. It’s actually pretty common, sad to say. They also often cower, tuck their tails, roll over on their backs, or flatten their ears. The good news? Most dogs stop having this pee-reaction by the time they are a year old.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nAnd even better? Dogs with this issue are usually the sweetest and most gentle pups. Sure, cleaning up the mess is annoying, but remember, it’s a sign your dog has a fantastic temperament. While you wait for this phase to pass, try having all greetings outside or on easy-to-clean floors, keeping the carpets off-limits when people come over. You can also toss a treat over your puppy’s head so they turn away and have a little snack before greeting you, which often helps prevent accidents.\nPeeing and pooping in the house\nAh yes, the messes we all dread. No one enjoys cleaning up after a puppy, especially when they leave little surprises around the house. But the optimistic take? Most dogs get the hang ofpotty trainingwithin a couple of months. Dogs naturally prefer to do their business far away from where they sleep, eat, and play. So, we’re on the same team here! When I taught puppy classes for dogs eight to 16 weeks old, the potty questions were constant, but by the time the puppies were in the next class, for puppies 16 weeks and older, nearly all of them had gotten the hang of it.\nTo help speed up the process, keep an eye on your puppy, take them outside frequently (especially after eating, enrichment activities, waking up, or playing), and reward them with yummy treats when they potty outside.\nPuppy mouthing\nPuppy teeth are sharp, as insharp as knives. And guess what? Puppies explore their world with their mouths. It’s totally normal for them tonip and bitewhen they’re excited, teething, or just want to play. But hey, we don’t want to feel like we’re beingchewed on like a toy. The good news is this phase doesn’t last forever.\nMost puppies go through a mouthy phase that peaks around three months and eases up by seven months. Tohelp your pupmove past this, give them tons ofappropriate chew toys, get them lots of exercise and mental stimulation, and if they get too bite-y with you, just walk away. They’ll eventually get the idea. And remember: Even if you don’t actively train them, most puppies will naturally stop with the mouthiness as they mature.\nDestructive chewing\nChewing is another one of those things that’s part of the puppy package. Puppies chew or destroy things (like toilet paper off the roll) to relieve teething pain, explore their environment, or to relieve energy. But that doesn’t mean they need to chew on your favorite boots or that couch you just bought. (Isn’t it always themost expensivething they choose?)\nThe good news is that this destructive chewing phase doesn’t last forever. Young puppies chew a lot, then slow down as they get older. Around the time they hit adolescence, though, they might hit another “chew frenzy,” but this is temporary, too. To save your stuff (and your sanity), make sure they have plenty of pup-safe chew treats orfrozen Kongs. It helps them understandwhat’s OK to chewand what’s off limits.\nAdolescent shyness\nIt’s common knowledge that many puppies go through a period of fearfulness at around two to three months. But did you knowadolescent dogsalso have an easily “spooked stage?” That may not be good news to anyone who is already going bonkers because their adolescent dog is ignoring them, being frustratingly independent, and generally not acting like the puppy they have come to know and love.\nWell, the good news is that this period is temporary, usually lasting just a few weeks or a month or so. With support from you — letting them be near you, giving them treats or toys when they are overwhelmed, andtalking to them cheerfully— many young dogs quickly stop being a little anxious and uncertain. Soon, they return to being the more confident pups they were before.\nExtreme energy and jumpiness\nLiving with a dog who seems to have unlimited energy? Yeah, I feel you. High-energy pups areexhausting. (Charming, butexhausting.) But don’t worry, while your dog might always be a bit of a ball of energy (because let’s face it, most dogs don’t turn into lazy couch potatoes), theywilleventually calm down. The youthful energy andconstant jumping aroundwon’t last forever.\nAs they get older, they’ll start to have more “chill” moments — andnotjust when they are sleeping. In the meantime, make sure they’regetting tons of exercise,mental stimulation, andenrichmentto help keep their brains and bodies busy. You’ll start to notice they can relax more and more as they mature.\nWhy you shouldn’t give up\nSadly, dogs don’t miraculously outgrow every behavior problem, but these common puppy issues usually fade with age. If any of these behaviors are one of your major stressors right now, hang in there! With a little time, patience, and the right support, your dog will soon be moving on from a lot of these habits. Keep doing your best, and enjoy the puppy journey — it’s so worth it.",

    "title": "A New Study Says 99% of Dogs Have Behavior Issues—These Are the Most Common",

  },
  "page_content": "We like to think of our dogs as perfect creatures — because, well, they are. But if we’re totally honest with ourselves, there are probably one or two things they could work on. Before you get defensive, rest assured that dealing with a few challenges doesn’t make your pet abad dog— in fact, it turns out that it makes them incredibly normal.A recent studypublished in theJournal of Veterinary Behaviorfound that 99.12 percent of dogs have behavioral issues.\nResearchers analyzed data from theDog Aging Project (DAP),a long-term scientific study which maintains a survey database of over 43,000 dogsand counting. For the DAP survey, pet parents rated behavioral issues on a scale from zero to four — zero meaning there is no problem, and four meaning the problem is serious. When researchers examined how many dogs had either one moderately serious to serious problem (rated three to four) or two moderate to serious problems (rated two to four), they found that nearly every single dog fit the bill.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nSome of the troubles were more common than others. Separation and attachment behaviors were the most popularly reported problems, with 86 percent of dogs experiencing moderate to serious issues. Fifty-six percent of dogs had trouble with aggression, and half of dogs struggled with fear and anxiety behaviors.\nOf course, most manifestations of behavioral challenges aren’t cut and dry. “The questions used in the study are not intended to be a diagnosis, and many behaviors overlap into different categories,” Dr. Bonnie Beaver, a study co-author,told Texas A&M.“For example, anxiety and separation are often related behaviors, but questions about them were put into separate categories. Dogs may act aggressively out of fear, but again the questions about each were in separate categories. So, a fear-biting dog may not be obvious in the results.”\nWhat you can do\nBeaver proposes that veterinarians and pet parents should work together to keep an eye on their pet’s problematic behaviors before they escalate. “Some studies report that only 50 percent of veterinarians ask questions about behavior during appointments, and owners may not think to ask the veterinarian about something they don’t like,” Beaver told Texas A&M. “This has to change, so we don’t end up missing half of the problems.”\nShe recommends that pet parents start by learning how to read theirpet’s body language.This is especially important when it comes to aggression, which can become dangerous if misunderstood. “Aggression is a normal behavior in animals and it happens for a reason,” Beaver told Texas A&M. “So, you need to consider why the dog is behaving that way. Is it fearful? Is it being threatened by a little kid getting too close, somebody staring in its eyes, by a bigger dog coming toward it, or by a stranger approaching? As veterinarians, we’ve got to look at the context in which a behavior happens to try and appreciate what might be going on in the animal’s mind.”\nThis is vital, she adds, when it comes to dogs who interacts with kids, who are unlikely to be able to adequately understand a dog’s perspective. Children should be taught how to interact with pets and encouraged to give any unknown dog space.\nOverall, it’s important that people give plenty of attention to their dog’s behavioral issues — even if they’re common. Helping a pup overcome the fears that motivate most bad behaviors is the best thing you can do for both of you. If you need to bring in the big guns, acertified dog trainercan be a life-saver. And even if your pup can’t 100 percent abandon their old ways, there are positive tactics you can use tomanage their behavior.\nAnd while dog training should be taken seriously, no one should be discouraged from adopting a dog by the sight of such a high statistic. After all, as hard as it may be to believe when looking into those wide puppy eyes, no one’s perfect.",

    "title": "Play or Aggression? How to Interpret a Dog Who’s Showing Teeth",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/dog-showing-teeth"
  },
  "page_content": "Seeing the corners of your dog’s mouth lift and their teeth appear in what looks like a goofy doggy grin never fails to make a pet parent smile. However, when those teeth are bared in a snarl, it elicits a very different reaction from pet parents because this body language can signal aggression. Interpreting your dog’s body language when they show their teeth is important for keeping your dog comfortable, as well as you and those around you safe.\nMichelle Baker, founder and dog behavior specialist atFurkids Inc., a canine daycare and enrichment center, says dogs have an entire language of their own. “One of their more misunderstood signals is showing their teeth. Is it a friendly grin or a warning? That all depends on the context and the rest of their body language,” she says. “Sometimes, it’s a warning: ‘Back off, I’m uncomfortable.’ Other times, it’s a submissive gesture, almost like a nervous smile. And yes, some dogsdo smile.”\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nBaker describes the submissive grin as a dog pulling back their lips like they’re cheesing for a photo. “It’s often seen in happy, friendly, and slightly nervous dogs trying to show they mean no harm,” she says.\nElisha Stynchula, a certified trainer and owner of“I Said Sit” School for Dogs, says if a dog is growling while showing their teeth, they’re communicating aggression. “In the most common meaning, a dog showing teeth in a growl is representing a threat display, to let someone or some dog know that the snarling dog is unhappy with the current situation,” she says. Meanwhile, other dogs may “make a little snarl when they are displaying submissive behavior and deferring to a human or dog.”\nA dog showing their teeth can mean playfulness, submission, aggression, fear, anxiety, or pain.\nA dog showing their teeth can mean playfulness, submission, aggression, fear, anxiety, or pain.\nStudy your dog’s body language when they show their teeth.

They’re responding to a stressor in their environment.\nWhat does it mean when a dog shows their teeth?\nLaurie Hood, the founder ofAlaqua Animal Refuge, sees thousands of dogs come through her doors, each with their own unique story. “One of the most heartwarming sights is when a dog enters our refuge, tail wagging and flashing what we lovingly call a ‘happy dog smile,’ ” she says. “But we also see dogs who show their teeth out of fear, stress, or uncertainty.”\nHow can you tell the difference between a dog who’s truly smiling and one who’s warning you to keep your distance? “Dogs use body language to communicate: showing their teeth can mean very different things depending on the situation,” Hood says.\nManaging expectations about your dog’s behavior makes for a good relationship\nOrigin of grinning in dogs\nBaker says the idea of dogs grinning dates back to when they were first domesticated. She says researchers including Konrad Lorenz (a pioneer in studying domesticated animals), Raymond Coppinger (who wrote extensively on the domestication and evolution of dogs), and Brian Hare (who focuses on dog cognition and evolution) have posited that dogs who could mimic human expressions like a smile were favored over dogs that weren’t as good at reading and responding to human social cues.\n“But can dogs truly smile in the way humans do?” Baker asks. “Not quite. Their version of a smile is more about body language and mimicking social cues that garner them positive attention. So, in a way, it’s kind of a symptom of happiness.”\nStynchula firmly believes some dogs in the community have developed grinning as a mimicking behavior. “There are also dogs who have been trained to show their teeth in a smile command that can be really cute to show off as a trick,” she says.\nCommon misconceptions about dogs showing teeth\nThe most common misconception is that any display of teeth equals aggression, Stynchula says. If you’re unsure, however, err on the side of caution. “Assume that it is aggressive rather than make the mistake and think that the dog is being submissive or displaying the rare doggy grin,” she says.\nBaker agrees it’s a misconception that any time a dog shows their teeth, they must be aggressive. “Dogs show teeth for many reasons, including fear, stress, submission, playfulness, or even pain. The trick is looking at the whole picture — are they stiff and growling, or loose and wiggly? A stiff body, tense face, and direct stare along with bared teeth? That’s a warning. A dog showing teeth while play-bowing and bouncing around? That’s likely just playful excitement. They also may expose teeth during playtime as a way to correct unwanted behavior in another dog. It’s their way of saying ‘I don’t like this, please stop.’”\nSimilarly, does your dog’s growlalways mean aggression? Sometimes, growling meansdogs are working it out. Hood adds thatwagging does not always signal friendliness. “Tail position and speed matter. A slow, stiff wag can mean tension, and a fast, aggressive wag can indicate stress.”\nThere’s abigdifference between a dog smiling and showing their teeth.\nSix common reasons why your dog is showing teeth\nAfearful dogmay show their teeth as a defensive signal, Baker says. Accompanying signs of fear include a low body posture, wide eyes, and pinned ears.\nAlong with teeth,signs of aggressioninclude a stiff posture, a hard stare, growling, and raised hackles. “The teeth are a warning, telling you to back off,” Hood says.\nMany dogs smile when they’re excited to see their favorite person.Play fightingcan be another reason for a friendly show of choppers. “When playing, some dogs will flash their teeth while wrestling or chasing, but their bodies remain loose and relaxed. This is often seen in social, confident dogs,” Hood says.\nLike a fearful or aggressive dog, an anxious dog may show their teeth.\n“Some dogs offer a submissive grin to show they mean no harm,” Hood says. “They’ll pull their lips back, wag their tails, and wiggle their whole body. This is an appeasement gesture, not a sign of aggression.”\nIf a normally friendly dog suddenly starts baring teeth when touched or approached, this could indicate an injury or illness that needs veterinary attention, Hood says.\nHow do submissive grins and warning grins look different?\nThe difference between asubmissive grinand a warning grin depends on the rest of the picture. “What is the dog’s body language telling you?” Stynchula asks. A dog with an aggressive, warning grin is going to be displaying stiff, upright behavior with theirears forward or back, depending on the individual dog. “In this case, there will likely be piloerection — when the hair is standing up on the dog’s back,” she says.\nIn a submissive display of teeth, the dog’s posture will likely resemble a crouch. “Many people mistake a submissive grin for aggression and vice versa, which is why it’s so important to look at the dog’s whole body language — not just their teeth,” Hood says.\nHow to respond when your dog shows teeth\nHood says Alaqua teaches adoptive dog parents that growling or teeth-baring is communication, not bad behavior. “A dog that’s punished for warning signs may learn to skip the warning and go straight to a bite,” she says.\nLike Hood, Stynchula says the biggest piece of advice she gives is to never punish a dog when they’re showing their teeth and growling. “That sounds counterintuitive to so many pet parents. However, the growl is the dog’s first level of communication that it’s uncomfortable. If you push a dog that’s growling, you’re likely to get a bite. And ifyou punish a dogthat’s growling, you’re likely to end up with a dog who skips growling. Next time the comment will be, ‘He bit out of nowhere. There was no sign.’ ”\nBaker suggests that you try to identify what’s making a dog uneasy and remove the stressor if possible. “Give them space, and don’t force interactions,” she says.\nIf your dog is habitually displaying their teeth in a sign of aggression, the sooner you call a behaviorist, the better. “If a dog consistently shows teeth in a tense, warning manner — especially if it’s accompanied by lunging or snapping — it’s important to seek help from a professional behaviorist or veterinarian,” Hood says. “At Alaqua, we work with behaviorists to help rehabilitate dogs who need extra support before they’re ready for adoption.”\nBaker says frequent, intense, and unpredictable growling and teeth-baring is a sign your dog is struggling with something bigger — fear,resource guarding, stress, oreven pain. “If there’s ever a bite involved, or if a dog is escalating in their warnings, it’s time to consult an expert before things get worse,” Baker says.\nCan you train your dog to smile by showing teeth?\nSome dogs, especially those prone to submissive grins, can learn to show their teeth in happy, controlled ways withpositive reinforcement, Baker says. “If a dog naturally grins when excited, you can pair it with a command like ‘smile’ and reward them with treats or praise. Just be sure not to encourage teeth-showing in a dog that tends to do it when stressed. It’s important to understand the ‘why’ behind the behavior before trying to shape it into a trick.”\nStynchula knows a dog who was trained to show his teeth in a big, silly looking grin. “That became his default behavior when he was greeting people. He was a big Labrador and not terribly scary, but it did make some people uncomfortable with his big old teeth-bearing grin,” she says.\nBottom line\nAt the end of the day, a dog’s smile, snarl, growl or tail wag is all about context, Baker says. “Watching their body language, energy, and the situation they’re in will tell you whether they’re feeling happy, worried, or playful. Understanding a dog’s body language and communication helps build a stronger, safer bond with our dogs, keeping communication clear and relationships thriving.”\nFAQs\nGrowling and teeth-baring are methods of canine communication — not bad behavior — and should not be punished. Instead, identify what’s making a dog uneasy and try to address it.\nDon’t overreact, and don’t punish the dog or yell at them. If you don’t know why the dog is baring their teeth — or they seem aggressive — carefully remove yourself from the situation.\nThey’re greeting you. Dogs show their teeth in something like a smile and wag their tails to show they’re happy to see you.\nDogs can be trained to smile, but a spontaneous display of teeth accompanied by loose, wiggly body language is a dog’s way of expressing joy. Other times, what looks like a smile is really a submissive grin.\nIf your dog suddenly seems more tense and aggressive, the sooner you call a veterinarian or behaviorist, the better.",

  },
  "page_content": "A lot happens on the couch, and all of it is interesting to your dog. Licking the couch is their way of “reading” what happened there. Dr. Antje Joslin ofDogtopiasays dogs lick the couch because they likehow it smells and tastes, they’re bored, or they’re trying to get your attention.\nThe couch is particularly interesting if you have children. No matter their age, kids like to eat on the couch, and will spill food on the couch. “Couches often have food crumbs, drink spills, or scents from people that attract dogs,” Joslin says.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nSometimes, however, licking the couch is a sign of a medical issue. “Licking can be a self-soothing behavior, similar to how some people bite their nails. It may help relieve anxiety or stress,” Joslin says.\nWhy do dogs lick furniture?\nLicking is normal instinctive, exploratory behavior. The most obvious reason dogs lick floors and furniture is to pick up interesting things (aka edible items) left behind. But licking the couch veers into obsessive territory when normal deterrents such as exercise, food, toys, and play aren’t enough to distract your dog.\nWe break down the most common reasons.\nMost common reasons your dog is licking the couch\nIf your dog doesn’t have much to do while you’re at work, and the couch and other furniture are sitting there, well…. Smith says, “Beyond medical causes, there are behavioral reasons for excessive licking.Boredom is a major factor. Dogs develop a habit of licking simply because it provides mental stimulation.”\nJust like people develop nervous habits (such as hand-wringing and toe-tapping), anxiety and stress trigger compulsive nervous licking in dogs when they feel uneasy or overwhelmed.\nDr. Marc Smith ofNatchez Trace Veterinary Services, sayspain and discomfortcan also lead to localized licking. “Joint pain, injuries, and infections may cause dogs to focus their licking on a specific area in an attempt to soothe discomfort,” he says. Inflammation or non-obvious issues such as nausea, dental issues, or a neurological problem may trigger compulsive licking. Don’t be alarmed but do call the vet.\nDr. Lindsey Kaplan, veterinarian at the dog care companyWoof, says dogs will lick areas of their body that hurt. “Dry skin, fungal or bacterial infections, or hot spots can lead to excessive licking of the dog’s body or furniture,” Kaplan says.\nIf you’ve heard ofobsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD) in people, then you know it occurs when normal behavior becomes repetitive with no obvious purpose or function, and disrupts daily activities. What may start as innocuous couch-licking can become obsessive behavior if it’s not addressed.\n“Separation anxiety or stress may also cause your dog to lick surfaces like the couch, floors, or themselves as a coping mechanism,” Kaplan says. “If licking is directed at a single object like the couch, it could be a sign of a compulsive behavior disorder.”\nThis is an obvious one. My dog Lilac loves popcorn as much as I do, and during movie night will lurk around the couch, licking up stray kernels. Even after you’ve cleaned the couch, it may smell enough like food that your dog is tempted to see if you missed any salty crumbs.\nAssuming you spend some of your non-working hours on the couch, it maysmell stronglyof you. If your dog is left at home for long periods, they may gravitate to the couch to comfort themselves with your smell.\n“If the couch smells like food or has acertain texture, it might attract your dog to lick it,” Kaplan says. Nubby-textured couches or real leather sofas made of cowhide may taste and smell particularly good. Leather, faux or not, and microfiber can be easier to clean.\nDogs explore with their mouths and noses, so it makes sense that the couch and other furniture in their territory are ripe for exploration.\nScent-markingis when dogs use urine to leave a message. Dogs signal their readiness to mark by sniffing and turning parallel to their target. It’s not the same as house soiling, and similarly shouldn’t be punished. If you see your dog sniffing near the couch or detect signs of urine, block their access to the couch and other targets, and consult a veterinarian or behaviorist for advice about discouraging scent-marking in the home.\nThat little nose sure works well...\nHow do you get your dog to stop licking the couch?\nFirst, Joslin says, clean food and residue with a pet-safe cleaner, and avoid eating or drinking on the couch (or other furniture) where your dog is licking.Like many other unwanted behaviors, licking can be deterred with a distraction. Try not to react when you see your dog licking because even a negative reaction is attention. Instead, firmly and gently redirect them. “Offer your pup chew toys, lick mats with peanut butter, or puzzle toys to keep them occupied,” Joslin says. “If your dog licks due to anxiety, try calming treats, pheromone diffusers, or a comfy dog bed as an alternative.”\nSmith says another option is an anti-lick spray. “Anti-lick sprays for dogs are specially formulated with bitter-tasting ingredients that deter licking, chewing, or biting of affected areas,” he says. “These sprays create an unpleasant taste that discourages the behavior without harming the dog, helping to break the cycle of excessive licking that can lead to conditions like lick granuloma.” He cautions that while anti-lick sprays can be effective as a short-term deterrent, they work best when combined with treatment of the underlying cause, whether it’s medical, behavioral, or emotional.\nBottom line\nIf the behavior persists or becomes obsessive, it’s a good idea to check with your vet to rule out medical issues and address any underlying illness. This is particularly true if licking is accompanied by signs of anxiety such as destructive behavior, panting, and pacing. “It may indicate stress or separation anxiety,” Kaplan says.\nFAQs\nExcessive couch licking may be a symptom of an underlying issue. Try diverting your dog’s attention with an engaging toy, a puzzle feeder, or even a dog bed made of fabric similar to the couch. Investing in a slipcover for your couch is another option until the behavior is under control. If the issue persists, consult a veterinarian.\nIf your dog licks the couch enough that the fabric is thinning, they may be able to access the stuffing more easily. Follow the strategies, above, to reduce licking.\nLeather is made of cattle hide, and for that reason, may be more appealing to dogs, just like chew toys made of rawhide. The upside of leather is that it’s easier to wipe-off food residue. If you’re worried your dog will destroy your leather couch, consider moving it to a room your dog can’t access or investing in a slipcover.\nOnly a vet can diagnose Cushing’s disease. But obsessive licking can be a symptom of this endocrine-based disorder that causes overproduction of the stress hormone cortisol, particularly in older dogs.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is when normal behavior becomes repetitive and disrupts daily activities. In dogs, OCD can manifest in numerous behaviors such as tail-chasing, fence running, and yes, couch-licking. If you suspect OCD, visit your vet for a diagnosis and treatment.\nReferences\nAstacio, Raquel. “Cushing’s Disease in Dogs: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatments.” Tails “N” Tummies, Tails “N” Tummies, 16 Jan. 2023,tailsntummies.com/blogs/education/dog-cushings-disease?srsltid=AfmBOorO00sEKSvzsVwIurt5HJ-pwTOokmL2MXkdFDVjeqX4zhdTQL--.\nAstacio, Raquel. “Cushing’s Disease in Dogs: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatments.” Tails “N” Tummies, Tails “N” Tummies, 16 Jan. 2023,tailsntummies.com/blogs/education/dog-cushings-disease?srsltid=AfmBOorO00sEKSvzsVwIurt5HJ-pwTOokmL2MXkdFDVjeqX4zhdTQL--.\nFarricelli, Adrienne. “10 Ways to Stop a Dog from Destroying the Couch When Left Alone.” HubPages, Feb. 2022,discover.hubpages.com/animals/How-Do-I-Stop-My-Dog-From-Destroying-the-Couch.\nFarricelli, Adrienne. “10 Ways to Stop a Dog from Destroying the Couch When Left Alone.” HubPages, Feb. 2022,discover.hubpages.com/animals/How-Do-I-Stop-My-Dog-From-Destroying-the-Couch.\n“Cushing’s Disease in Dogs: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatments.” Tailsntummies:https://tailsntummies.com/blogs/education/dog-cushings-disease?srsltid=AfmBOorO00sEKSvzsVwIurt5HJ-pwTOokmL2MXkdFDVjeqX4zhdTQL--\n“Cushing’s Disease in Dogs: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatments.” Tailsntummies:https://tailsntummies.com/blogs/education/dog-cushings-disease?srsltid=AfmBOorO00sEKSvzsVwIurt5HJ-pwTOokmL2MXkdFDVjeqX4zhdTQL--",

  "page_content": "My dog, Lilac, is a licker. She licks her bed, the floor, the dining table chairs, and even the grass. Dr. Lindsey Kaplan, a veterinarian at the dog care companyWoof, says licking is a natural behavior that serves a variety of purposes from communication to self-care. Lilac’s licking seems like normal exploratory behavior, but sometimes I worry itsignals anxiety.“While occasional licking is normal, excessive licking may signal a deeper issue, such as health or behavioral problems,” Kaplan says.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nUnderstanding the behavior: Why dogs lick\nAlicia Collins, founder and CEO of theK9 Activity Club,sayslicking is instinctive. It’s how a dog gathersscent informationthrough their Jacobson’s organ (or vomeronasal organ) on the roof of their mouth, which helps them analyze pheromones and chemical signals in their environment.\nBut licking can also be a learned habit and a potential warning. “While licking is a normal part of being a dog, the reason behind it depends on the situation,” Collins says.\nCollins lists some of the main reasons why dogs lick:\nCare, affection, and bonding: “From the moment puppies are born, mother dogs lick them for grooming, warmth,and bonding. This instinct continues into adulthood, with dogs licking their pet parents and other dogs as a way to show love and affection.”\nCare, affection, and bonding: “From the moment puppies are born, mother dogs lick them for grooming, warmth,and bonding. This instinct continues into adulthood, with dogs licking their pet parents and other dogs as a way to show love and affection.”\nCommunication and submission:Collins says puppies in the wild lick their mother’s mouth to request food, while younger or more submissive dogs may lick dominant ones as a sign of respect and deference. “In a pack, dominant dogs eventually correct excessive licking by showing mild dominance — such as baring teeth or giving a warning snap.” If a domesticated dog continually licks their pet parent without receiving feedback or correction, licking can become an obsessive behavior over time.\nCommunication and submission:Collins says puppies in the wild lick their mother’s mouth to request food, while younger or more submissive dogs may lick dominant ones as a sign of respect and deference. “In a pack, dominant dogs eventually correct excessive licking by showing mild dominance — such as baring teeth or giving a warning snap.” If a domesticated dog continually licks their pet parent without receiving feedback or correction, licking can become an obsessive behavior over time.\nTaste and exploration:“Dogs use their mouths and tongues to explore the world, much like human babies do. They may lick you because they enjoy the salty taste of your skin or because they detect interesting scents on your hands,” Collins says. “If a dog licks furniture or floors persistently, they may be investigating leftover food smells or past spills.”\nTaste and exploration:“Dogs use their mouths and tongues to explore the world, much like human babies do. They may lick you because they enjoy the salty taste of your skin or because they detect interesting scents on your hands,” Collins says. “If a dog licks furniture or floors persistently, they may be investigating leftover food smells or past spills.”\nGrooming and cleaning:Just like cats (though maybe not as much), dogs groom themselves. “Since they don’t have hands to clean themselves, they use their tongue to remove dirt and debris from their fur,” Collins says. “If your dog licks you, it may be their way of ‘grooming’ you as part of their pack.”\nGrooming and cleaning:Just like cats (though maybe not as much), dogs groom themselves. “Since they don’t have hands to clean themselves, they use their tongue to remove dirt and debris from their fur,” Collins says. “If your dog licks you, it may be their way of ‘grooming’ you as part of their pack.”\nStress, anxiety, or comfort:Some dogs lick excessively when they are stressed, anxious, or bored. “The repetitive motion can be self-soothing, similar to a child sucking their thumb,” Collins explains.\nStress, anxiety, or comfort:Some dogs lick excessively when they are stressed, anxious, or bored. “The repetitive motion can be self-soothing, similar to a child sucking their thumb,” Collins explains.\nThey especially love to do this when they’re ignoring you.\nHealth-related reasons for licking\nCollins adds medical issues to her list of reasons why dogs lick. Kaplan agrees, saying allergies, pain and discomfort, skin conditions, and digestive issues are all health-related reasons for licking. “Dogs with allergies often lick in addition to, or instead of, scratching themselves,” Kaplan says. “They may excessively lick themselves — often their paws, genitals, or anus — or lick inanimate objects in their environment.”\nDr. Marc Smith ofNatchez Trace Veterinary Services,says dogs lick to soothe themselves when they have stomach pain. “Dogs experiencing nausea or gastrointestinal discomfort may lick excessively as a sign that they are feeling unwell,” Smith says.\nIn his clinic, food and environmental allergies are the most common causes of skin-related licking. “While dogs may lick to relieve itchiness, the licking behavior can actually make things worse,” Smith says. “Excessive licking creates a moist environment where bacteria can thrive, increasing the risk of infections.”\nBehavioral factors that cause licking\nBoredom and anxiety, including separation anxiety, may cause dogs to lick excessively. “If a dog is left alone or lacks mental stimulation, they may resort to licking as a self-soothing or attention-seeking behavior,” Kaplan says.\nSome dogs lick furniture or people for attention if they’ve been rewarded with affection or treats for that behavior, Kaplan says. “Without intervention, licking becomes a compulsive habit, particularly if your dog finds it rewarding or calming,” she says.\nHow does that taste, bud?\nWhy dogs lick specific things\nSmith, Kaplan, and Collins all agree that there are underlying reasons why dogs lick everything.\nIt’s well known that dogs lick people to show affection and get attention. Smith says licking can be a sign of submissiveness. “They may also lick human skin due to food residue, natural saltiness, orenticing scents,” he says.\nIf you see your dog licking the air like a lizard, examine them for nausea, anxiety, dental issues, or a neurological problem. If it happens frequently, discuss it with a veterinarian.\nNo matter how clean you keep your house, furniture has intriguing tastes, smells, and textures.\nThe most obvious reason forlicking the flooris that someone (maybe them) spilled food there. “When dogs lick the floor, it’s often because they smell food particles,” Smith says. “However, excessive floor licking can also become a compulsive habit linked to boredom.”\nToys are designed with dog-friendly flavors and textures, so they’re a good option for licking. Dogs might lick their toys to showexcitement or enjoyment, Kaplan says. It can also be a comforting behavior, similar to a dog carrying around a toy like a security object, Smith notes.\nDogs oftenlick each otheras a sign of social bonding, grooming, or affection, Kaplan says. Smith says this is a natural pack behavior. “In multi-dog households, licking can play a role in social bonding and hierarchy,” he says. “It is often a submissive gesture, with lower-ranking dogs licking more dominant ones to reinforce social structure.”\nSome dogs put the ‘ick’ in ‘lick’ — if seeing them lick their own genitals isn’t your thing. “Licking their own body, especially their paws, is a natural grooming behavior,” Kaplan says. “However, excessive licking of one area may signal allergies, irritation, or infection.”\nWhen to be concerned about excessive licking\nIf a dog repeatedly licks a specific area of their body, this could indicate an underlying health issue, such as an allergy, insect bite, infection, or injury, Collins says.Nausea can causeexcessive licking of the lips, floors, or objects. “If you notice excessive licking, especially paired with hair loss, sores, or digestive issues, it’s best to consult a veterinarian,” Collins says.\nSmith advises seeking help before the issue worsens if licking is affecting your dog’s quality of life. “When a dog obsessively licks a specific area, the repeated friction and moisture break down the skin’s natural barrier, leading to inflammation and irritation,” he explains. “The constant licking triggers a cycle of discomfort as the irritated skin becomes itchy or painful, prompting even more licking.”\nOver time, the affected area thickens, develops sores, and can become infected, resulting in a condition known as lick granuloma oracral lick dermatitis. “Without intervention, lick granulomas can become chronic, requiring a multifaceted approach to healing that addresses both the physical wound and the root cause of the compulsive behavior,” Smith says.\nHow to change your dog’s excessive licking behavior\nExcessive licking can be reduced with patience, training, and help from a veterinarian or behaviorist if you suspect medical issues. Kaplan suggests first giving your dog more mental and physical stimulation. “Ensure your dog gets plenty of exercise and mental stimulation through play, walks, and puzzle toys,” she says. “This can reduce boredom-related licking.”\nRedirect your dog’s licking behavior to something positive, like an absorbing toy (for instance, Woof makes an innovative treat-filled toycalled the Pupsicle). Reward them when they stop licking and engage with the toy or exhibit another healthy behavior, Kaplan says.\nTeach your dog simple cues like “leave it” or “no lick.” Consistent training can break the habit over time. Then there are products designed to discourage licking. “If your dog is licking furniture, you can try using a pet-safe deterrent spray,” Kaplan says. “These sprays usually have an unpleasant bitter taste or scent that will discourage licking.”\nIf anxiety is a factor in your dog’s excessive licking, your treatment plan could include calming aids like pheromone diffusers, anxiety wraps, or products to help reduce stress. “Calming products can work alongside behavior modification to help relax your dog, reducing anxiety-driven licking,” Kaplan says. Your veterinarian might also recommend anxiety medications.\nSmith says one of the most effective ways to deter excessive licking is to modify the dog’s environment and routine. “Ensuring enough physical and mental activity can prevent boredom-induced licking, while also helping rule out potential triggers,” he says.\nBottom line\nCollins says most of the time, licking is a harmless expression of affection, curiosity, or self-care. But if the licking is related to a health issue, boredom, or anxiety, identifying the reason for obsessive licking will help determine the best course of action. “With proper treatment, training, and care, most dogs can learn to reduce or stop excessive licking,” Kaplan says. “If the behavior persists, or if there are signs of injury or discomfort, it’s important to consult with your veterinarian.”\nFAQs\nConsult a vet if excessive licking is causing redness and hot spots. Licking may be a sign of allergies, pain, and digestive issues that can be treated by a veterinarian. Licking furniture or air might indicate nausea, anxiety, dental issues, or a neurological problem.\nDiscussing the context of your dog’s licking with a veterinarian or behaviorist can help you determine if there’s a health issue or if the licking is a behavioral problem.\nIf it’s hard to interrupt your dog’s licking, or if they return to licking after a brief interruption, they may have a medical issue or they’ve developed a compulsive disorder.\nPossibly. Make sure your dog has plenty of fresh, clean water, and consult your veterinarian about the right diet to make sure your dog is getting the nutrients they need.\nNot always. Licking is a normal behavior that dogs use to explore the world andto communicate. If it becomes repetitive and obsessive, however, this can mean your dog is stressed, anxious, or bored. Depending on where your dog is licking, it could also indicate a health issue.\nVisit a vet if your dog is repeatedly licking a specific area of their body, causing sores and hair loss. This could indicate allergies, infection, or injury. Nausea and digestive issues can also cause excessive licking of the lips, floors, objects, and even the air.\nReferences\n“Lick Granuloma in Dogs.”Vca_corporate,vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/lick-granuloma-in-dogs.",

If you’re wondering how to stop your dog from jumping on the couch, the answer is that it’s going to take time, effort, and a lot of patience.\n“If, for some reason, you don’t want your dog on your couch, it’s important to provide them with alternative behaviors,” certified professional dog trainer and authorSassafras Patterdalesays. “Make sure that your dog has comfortable and appropriate places to lay and sleep near where you are, such as dog beds.

Dogs may also dig in the couch because there are crumbs, food, treats, etc., buried in the cushions.”\nSome dogs may also dig at the couch as an attention-seeking behavior or even out of boredom, so make sure your pup gets plenty of exercise and purchase some interactive toys to stimulate their mind.

Your pup is less likely to try to jump on the furniture if it’s inconvenient for them to do so.\nPositive reinforcementtraining can also go a long way, especially withyoung dogs, but you can train an adult dog, too. Reward your dog with treats for avoiding the furniture. You can also use clicker training. Just make sure to train consistently and regularly to help reinforce the behavior you want.\nIf you try all the above solutions and nothing works, you may need to consider a compromise — or even letting your dog win. Some people allow their pets on the furniture, and that’s fine. You may just want to invest in waterproof pet blankets or couch covers to protect your sofa.\nIn between cuddle sessions, work on these eight basic cues with your pup.\nHow to deter your dog from jumping on the sofa\nIf you’re frantically googling “how to keep my dog off the sofa,” you’re likely to find a lot of suggestions, but it’s important to choose a method that works best for your dog and their particular personality. Deterrents can be helpful when it comes to keeping your pet off the couch, but they work best when paired with consistent training. Focus on thoseobedience basicswhile also considering these solutions.\nPlacing aluminum foil on the couch, especially when you’re away from home, can deter your dog from jumping on the sofa. The uncomfortable texture and crinkly noise make the couch cushions significantly less appealing.\nMaking noise, such as shaking coins in a jar when your dog jumps on the sofa, may deter them from jumping up there in the future. Just consider whether your dog is already easily startled by loud noises, such as thunder or fireworks. You don’t want to give your pup a new fear or make an existing one worse.\nWhen you’re away from home or out of the room, you can physically block the sofa so your dog can’t access it. If the room has a door, simply close it or use baby gates to keep your pet away from the couch. You can also set up cushions as a barrier around the furniture.\nIf you need a stronger deterrent for a dog on the couch, consider investing in products like couch defenders or training mats. Couch defenders are small barriers that you can place around furniture to keep pets away. They’re available in neutral colors to match your decor and can be easily folded up and stored when you have company.\nTraining mats are placed directly on the couch cushions and are available in a variety of sizes. They can be covered in small, pointy nubs that are uncomfortable for your dog to sit on, or there are more high-tech versions that emit an annoying noise or a small static shock when your dog touches them. Both options are safe deterrents to help keep your dog away from your furniture.\nReferences\n“5 Tips for Successful Dog Training.”Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine | Virginia Tech,vetmed.vt.edu/news/2023/dog-training-tips.html.\n“5 Tips for Successful Dog Training.”Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine | Virginia Tech,vetmed.vt.edu/news/2023/dog-training-tips.html.\nBasic Dog Training Concepts.www4.uwsp.edu/psych/dog/la/drp12.htm.\nBasic Dog Training Concepts.www4.uwsp.edu/psych/dog/la/drp12.htm.\nBoston, City of. “Pet Behavior Tips.”Boston.gov, 23 Nov. 2019,www.boston.gov/departments/animal-care-and-control/pet-behavior-tips.\nBoston, City of. “Pet Behavior Tips.”Boston.gov, 23 Nov. 2019,www.boston.gov/departments/animal-care-and-control/pet-behavior-tips.\n“Digging in Dogs.”Animal Health Topics / School of Veterinary Medicine, 24 Nov. 2021,healthtopics.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/health-topics/canine/why-does-my-dog-dig.\n“Digging in Dogs.”Animal Health Topics / School of Veterinary Medicine, 24 Nov. 2021,healthtopics.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/health-topics/canine/why-does-my-dog-dig.\n“Dog Training | Dog Training Tools.”Community Care College, 3 Apr. 2023,communitycarecollege.edu/veterinary-assistant/dog-training.\n“Dog Training | Dog Training Tools.”Community Care College, 3 Apr. 2023,communitycarecollege.edu/veterinary-assistant/dog-training.\nTodd, Zazie. “All About Dog Training: The Best Way to Train Your Dog.”Companionanimalpsychology.com, Blogger, 6 Oct. 2020,www.companionanimalpsychology.com/p/all-about-dog-training-how-to-train.html\nTodd, Zazie. “All About Dog Training: The Best Way to Train Your Dog.”Companionanimalpsychology.com, Blogger, 6 Oct. 2020,www.companionanimalpsychology.com/p/all-about-dog-training-how-to-train.html\n“Training Tips for Dogs.”VMBS News, 11 Mar. 2022,vetmed.tamu.edu/news/pet-talk/training-tips-for-dogs.\n“Training Tips for Dogs.”VMBS News, 11 Mar. 2022,vetmed.tamu.edu/news/pet-talk/training-tips-for-dogs.\n“Why Do Dogs Chew, Dig and Tear Stuff Up?” Richmond SPCA,www.montgomerycountymd.gov/animalservices/Resources/Files/Preventing%20%Destructive%20Beahvior%20in%20the%20Home%20PDF(1).pdf.\n“Why Do Dogs Chew, Dig and Tear Stuff Up?” Richmond SPCA,www.montgomerycountymd.gov/animalservices/Resources/Files/Preventing%20%Destructive%20Beahvior%20in%20the%20Home%20PDF(1).pdf.",

  "page_content": "Dogs engage in numerous behaviors that are mystifying, and to humans, disgusting. For some pet parents, hand licking is one of them. Patting my dog Lilac becomes a game of keep-away if I don’t want her licking my hands, which I confess sometimes grosses me out. Learning the origin of this behavior has given me a fresh perspective. Besides, there’s always soap and water.\nDr. Aimee Warner, a veterinarian at the pet-insurance companyWaggel, describes hand-licking as something of an honor. “The hand-licking of your dog can be traced back to canid puppies,” Warner says. “These puppies in the wild are known to lick their mother’s mouth to get her to regurgitate food. When your dog licks your hands, it’s a way of showing trust and affection to you as their provider.”\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nParham Raoufi, founder ofPaws Grooming Empire, says hand licking is a way for dogs to connect and convey emotions. “Dogs frequently lick your hands due to their desire for affection, curiosity, and need for reassurance,” Raoufi says.\nWhy does my dog lick my hands?\nWarner says dogs have extremely sensitive taste buds that help them gather information, much like talking and reading. Just like a good conversation is satisfying to us, a hearty hand lick releases yourdog’s endorphins. “When they lick your hands, they’re actually getting precise chemical information about your activities and location during the day, essentially ‘reading” your day,” she says. “When they lick your hands, they show affection while also making themselves feel good.”\nParham says in the absence of verbal communication, licking is aform of self-expression. “A dog depends on scent along with flavor and skin perception to investigate the environment,” he says. “After a sniffing investigation, your dog moves on to lick you using both scent and tasting abilities to study your scent identity.”\nThe sentiment is nice, but...\nMost common reasons your dog is licking your hands\nParham says dogs typically lick your hands for three main reasons: greeting, affection, and information-seeking. Pay attention to the context of the licking, because it usually provides some clue as to its meaning. “Knowing these subtleties will enable you to better understand what your dog is attempting to convey through this behavior,” Warner says.\nThis is the primary reason your dog licks your hands. Warner says occasional licks during periods of relaxation signify affection.\nOpening the door to wiggles and tail-wagging is one of the best parts of being a dog parent. Licking your hands is just another way for your dog to greet you.\nRepetitive licking and pawing can signal an underlying issue.\nLicking is a way for dogs to soothe themselves. “More licking on the occasion of thunderstorms or fireworks displaysindicates nervousness,” Warner says.\nParham points to increased licking as a possible sign of allergies, injuries, or joint pain. When this becomes obsessive or leads toskin irritation, it’s time to call the vet.\nThose taste buds on a dog’s tongue aresensitive. With that in mind, Warner says your hands might be telling your dog an interesting story.\nTheir toes might smell like Fritos, but there’s no way they tastethatgood.\nWhen is your dog licking your hands a problem?\nParham says a certain amount of licking is common behavior, but if the licking increases rapidly, this may indicate health problems. “Dogs tend to lick frequently when they experience symptoms of anxiety, stress, or appear unwell,” he says. “Frequent licking in dogs sometimes develops when they have allergies, injuries, or joint pain.”\nOther problem signs to watch out for include hand-licking disrupting their daily routine, causing skin irritation (for you or the dog), or when it’s followed by other undesired behaviors such as pacing, whining, or destructiveness. It’s also telling when your dog protests when you try to stop them from licking.\nHow to stop your dog from licking your hands excessively\nExperts agreethat redirection, positive reinforcement, and exercise all help reduce excessive hand-licking. Since licking is an inherent behavior for dogs, it’s difficult to stop it entirely, Parham says.

Also, employ consistent verbal cues. “Teach ‘no lick’ or an equivalent command, rewarding them when they [stop licking].”\nWhen your dog isn’t licking, engage in positive reinforcement training with a reward. Since a tired dog is a calm dog, make sure your dog is getting plenty of exercise and mental stimulation. If the licking appears to be anxiety-induced, identify and remove the cause of anxiety. In the case of a thunderstorm or unavoidable loud noises in the vicinity, ease your dog’s urge to lick your hands by redirecting them.\nThen there’s the obvious: “Wash hands thoroughly,” Warner says. “Eliminate food odors that are possibly enticing them.”\nKeep in mind that some licking is perfectly normal and even healthy bonding behavior. “It’s only when it gets out of hand that you’ll need to take action,” Warner says. “If the behavior recurs or appears to be compulsive, consult with your veterinarian or a professional animal behaviorist.”\nFAQs\nLicking is normal behavior. Dogs lick our hands to show affection, self-soothe, and investigate what we’ve been eating.\nYou can train your dog not to lick your hands, and by understanding why dogs lick our hands (read the full guide, above), maybe take some of the “ick” out of “lick.”\nYes, obsessive licking may signify anxiety, boredom, allergies, pain, or injury.\nHealth-wise, hand-licking is generally safe. However, dog saliva does contain bacteria, so it’s best to wash your hands after your dog has licked them, particularly if you’re immune-compromised or about to prepare food.\nTry redirecting both of them by asking them to sit calmly for a few seconds and rewarding them when they do.",

  "page_content": "Training dogs is one of the great joys of my life, so many clients are surprised when I see a dog’s problematic behavior and don’t immediately suggest some training techniques to fix it. Instead, I might say, “Let’s use management here!” In other words, we can find some simple hacks — aka manage the pup’s environment — first to eliminate anything that might be causing them to, for example, root through the trash,bark at any guestwho comes to your door, or run off to rip up your brand-new couch.\nMaking changes to positively influence the behavior of dogs is popular in the dog-training world, but there’s some shame associated with it among many pet parents. There’s a tendency to think that this approach is a cop-out, but I totally disagree. Management is a great way to help dogs in challenging situations by making iteasierfor them to do the right thing. These simple suggestions that I give my clients are often straightforward and require minimal effort. You may even say “duh” at a few of these and wonder why you never tried them. No worries — that’s why I’m here to help.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nHere are a few of my favorite hacks for preventing problem behavior before it even begins.\nKeep “intruders” out of their sight line.\nBlock the glass portion of your front door with fabric or a poster board to keep your dog from standing there all day getting upset by all the passersby. Some dogs get excited by people outside in a good way, but others watch on edge and survey your property like a sentry. According to them, everyone is trespassing, no exceptions. Covering the glass so your dog doesn’t see what’s out there can add calm, peace, and quiet to many households.\nDitch the doorbell.\nDisconnect your doorbell if your dog goes wild when anyone rings it. Knocking is far less upsetting to almost all dogsthan the doorbell. If your pup is not worked up to begin with, it will be easier to teach them to sit, go to their “place,” or togo get a toywhen someone is at the door.\nKeep all the “no-no” items away from them.\nPutting secure tops on tempting containers can be a game changer in many households. A covered garbage can stop dogs from having a trash party. And a covered hamper prevents dogs fromgetting socks and underwearto grab or eat. (Thisdog who ate 24 sockscould have used a hamper with a lid!) For truly committed dogs, putting these items behind a closed door may be necessary. I suggest putting the laundry basket in a closed closet and the kitchen trash can in the garage or under the sink (if possible) to avoid problems.\nGive them some slack on the leash.\nUse a 10-to-12-foot leash on walks instead of a four-to-six-foot leash toprevent pulling. Many dogs just need a little more room to roam and don’t pull as hard with that extra line. Some will pull no matter what the length of the leash is, but for a lot of dogs, a longer leash makes walks more fun (and safer!) for everyone.\nTo find out which type of walker you have, attach two shorter leashes to double the length of their leash as a test. This way, you can figure out if a longer-leash hack will work for them. Another way to lessen pulling is to go on an out-and-back route rather than a loop. A lot of dogs don’t pull, or at least not nearly as much, when they are retracing their steps (they are less curious about somewhere they’ve already been). So, this method may get you half a walk free of pulling, which is a big improvement.\nProvide them with plenty of activities.\nGive your dog something to do so they don’t get bored and try to entertain themselves by being mischievous. Most dogs have certain times of day or certain situations when they are more likely to get into trouble. For many dogs, mischief o’clock is mid-morning or late afternoon.\nOnce you know your dog’s witching hour for naughtiness, get in the habit of giving them something to dobeforethere’s a problem. For example, give your dog astuffed Kongwhen you are making dinner so they don’t try to help themselves to your ingredients. Give them something new to chew on before your friends come over. Have pre-prepped items, like a stuffed Kong that has already been frozen in the freezer, that you can easily give your dog if you need to occupy them at the last minute for any reason.\nBlock their access to the counter to begin with.\nCounter surfing behaviorwill happen if you don’t prepare. If, the first time your dog puts their paws on the counter, they find a jackpot of food they can snack on, they will try to get up on that counter again as soon as they can.\nTo keep them from being rewarded, block access to the counter, especially while you are cooking and food is all over the place, or nobody is watching the counter. Try putting up a baby gate, put them in a pen or crate in the kitchen, ortether themso they can’t reach the counter. Another option is to open your drawersjust enoughso they can’t reach the counter. Either keep the counters clear of food completely, store food that’s on the counter in closed containers, or push the food to the back of the counter so your dog can’t reach it (unless they are so tall that that  simply won’t work).\nBottom line: Control the environment so you don’t have to work so hard to control your dog.\nAlmost everyone with a dog is dealing with some kind of behavior they don’t like. But you don’t always have tohire a behavioristto work on all of these things. Try some of the above ideas and see how much better things get. Then you can narrow in on a training plan for any issues that remain. This way, life is easier for everyone.\nFor more tips on managing your dog’s behavior, check out Juliana DeWillems’snew bookManage It!: Hacks for Improving Your Dog’s Behavior.",

  "page_content": "Chasing cars isn’t just a classicSnow Patrol song— it’s also a dog behavior that’s so common you can find it in cartoons and comic strips. But what may be funny in two dimensions can be deadly in reality, and you definitely don’t want your dog to get in the habit of pursuing your neighbor’s Subaru when they leave for work each day.\nKeeping your dog safely inside or in the backyard is one option, but thaturge to chasewon’t simply go away on its own. How can you stop your dog from trying to take a bite out of a sedan (and endangering their life in the process)?\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nWhy do some dogs seem to lose their minds when a truck goes by?\nWhy do dogs chase cars?\nIf you see your dog chase a car — or attempt to — it can be easy to see the behavior asimpulsive. But chasing is anatural dog behavior. Dogs have a naturalprey chase drive(also known as a predatory chase drive), which means they often feel theoverwhelming urgeto chase … well, anything: other dogs, cats, birds, small animals, and, yes, cars.\n“Chasing cars is a very natural behavior for a lot of dogs,” certified professional dog trainer and authorSassafras Patterdalesays.\nThe rapid movement of another animal or object in particular triggers dogs to chase; it’s like a reflex. “The sound and movement of moving cars, especially fast-moving cars, taps into a dog’s natural prey drive or, depending on the breed, herding drive,” Patterdal says.\nSome breeds have been bred for hunting and pursuit, which means they may have higher prey drives than others and may make them more likely to go after a passing car. Other dogs want to chase because it’s simply fun and activates the pleasure centers in their brains. Others still are stressed by the sound and movement of cars, which they may respond to by engaging in chasing behaviors orlungingat passing cars.\nSafety above all else\nEven if their impulse to chase is natural, the last thing you want is your dog lunging at cars or, even worse, pulling away from you and giving chase. The result could be injury or even death to your pet, not to mention potential injury to you if your dog pulls you down or liability for collisions or accidents.\nIf you’re wondering how to stop a dog chasing cars, it’s important to start by keeping your distance from any traffic, no matter how slow, until you train your dog to react appropriately.\nHow far away should you and your dog be from traffic? That depends on your dog’s comfort level. Standing on the sidewalk may be plenty of distance for some pups, while others may need a little more space when training.\n“Try to walk your dog at a distance where they are able to see cars but aren’t inspired to chase them,” Patterdale recommends. “If your dog is over-aroused by the moving vehicles, try to move farther away.”\nKeeping your dog on a leash, preferably a short, six-foot lead, not a retractable or long-line one, is also important, according to Patterdale. “Safety is a first priority,” Patterdale says. “Dogs should be on leashes when out walking to prevent them from being able to access cars they are chasing.”\nMake sure you also have a secure grip on the leash or use a wearable, hands-free option that tethers your dog to you.\nHow do you stop a dog from chasing cars?\nBefore you can teach your dog not to chase cars, you have to have the basics down. Work on the “stay” command until your dog understands tohold their positionuntil you release them. You can also teach your dog “watch me,” which encourages them to focus on you and ignore their surroundings. It’s also essential to practice and trust inyour dog’s recallso you know they’ll come when called, even in exciting situations.\n“It’s important to understand why our dogs are chasing cars and that it’s natural for dogs,” Patterdale says. “We want to focus on creating opportunities for them to be successful.”\nTo teach your dog chase is not for cars, regularly practice rewarding their attention with cars in sight, either with a treat or a clicker if you preferclicker training.\n“When your dog sees a car, praise and treat them,” Patterdale says. “This can help to shift your dog’s emotional response to the moving vehicles.”\nWhen your pup consistently looks at you rather than a passing car, slowly begin to decrease the distance between your dog and the traffic. Creating this positive association around cars is known as counterconditioning — usingpositive reinforcementtraining to help your dog learn new behaviors.\nFor some dogs, it’s not as simple as just throwing a ball.\nToys for dogs with high prey drives\nKeeping your dog physically and mentally stimulated can also help reduce your dog’s prey drive. Consider interactive toys that tap into your pup’s natural hunting and chasing instincts andeducational toys, such as puzzles that engage your dog’s brain. If you have a dog with prey drive, the right toys can simulate hunting without putting your pet in danger.\nAnother thing you can do is provide your pet withplenty of exercise, with or without the use of toys. Toys that help facilitategames of fetchor tug of war,playing fetchwithout a toy, or even organized dog sports, such as herding trials, provide opportunities forplaythat are healthier and safer alternatives to pursuing vehicles.\nIf your dog keeps chasing after cars (or trying to) even after you’ve worked consistently on training, you may want to enlist the help of a professional dog behaviorist. A specialist may be able to help determine issues or breed traits that could cause your dog’s chasing behavior.\nReferences\n“Animal Safety Tips.”Veterinary Hospital,hospital.cvm.ncsu.edu/resources/animal-safety-tips.

  "page_content": "As much as you love your leash-reactive dog, they can make walks challenging, to say the least. When they throw a fit because they see another dog, a person, or a leaf that blows their way, it can be downright mortifying. Other dog parents stare while their own pup walks serenely past your own, as if silently judging you. Before you head out on a walk with your leash-volatile pup, you probably find yourself singing some version of Sabrina Carpenter’s “Please, Please, Please.” (“Heartbreak is one thing, my ego’s another. I beg you, don’t embarrass me...”)\nUnfortunately, there is no magic way to get them to stop this behavior. Effectively managing leash reactivity requires patience and diligence. Leash reactivity involvesdogs lunging, barking, or otherwise responding explosively to passing people, animals, or stimuli while restrained on walks.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nTackle leash reactivity with these steps:\nStep one: Create positive associations.\nBegin counterconditioning your pup’s behaviorusing high-value treatsthat you only give them during outings to shift associations with triggers from scary to pleasant. Reward disengagement.\nStep two: Change it up.\nChoose alternate walking routes and times toavoid likely triggersfor quick wins while rigorously training emotional control around milder stimuli. Avoid aggravating triggers, which can delay their progress.\nStep three: Purchase a better leash.\nInvest in adaptable transitional leashes that enable you to adjust control while preventing lungingand nibbling.Neverdrag or choke your dog with their leash, which only exacerbates bad behaviors and creates negative associations.\nStep four: Refocus your dog’s attention.\nInterrupt fixating triggers by changing direction, blocking sight lines, or creating distractions, likesqueaking a toy. Refocus their attention positively on you rather than allowing them to fixate on stimuli.\nStep five: Stay calm.\nModel relaxed, tension-free body language. Soothing praise for appropriate check-ins reinforces focusing on you over their environment. Remember, excitable or tense human energy oftenmakes dogs more reactive.\nStep six: Assess your dog’s triggers.\nConsider why your dog may dislike restraints — feeling vulnerable, lacking environmental awareness, or associating proximity to you with other “threats,” like other people walking their dogs, could all contribute. Identify and resolve root causes when feasible.\nWhat is leash reactivity?\nLeash reactivity is when your dog overreacts to a stimulus while they are on a leash. Dogs can be “reactive” toward any kind of trigger they have a negative association with, such as other dogs, cars, or people. As mentioned above, reactivity could look like lunging, barking, orgrowling. Some dogs may be fearful or try to run away from the thing that upsets them.\nWhere does this reactive behavior come from? To understand reactivity, it’s first necessary to understand how a dog communicates (hint: it’s a lot different than how humans communicate). Dogs prefer to give each other space, circle around each other,sniff butts, and then maybe play or, if they decide they don’t like each other, get out of each other’s faces.\nAnd what happens when you introduce a leash into the mix? Well, a leash essentially puts a dog in a “cage” — their movements are restricted, largely out of their control. On-leash greetings often occur head-on andface-to-face, which is not a typical way for dogs to greet each other naturally. There are several reasons why a dog may not like this type of greeting:\nSome dogs get very sensitive or upset when a stranger (human or canine) comes close to their beloved pet parent.\nSome dogs get really excited by the prospect of saying hey to another dog — but alas — the leash! It gets in the way, and then they get frustrated.\nIf a dog is fearful of the stimuli in front of them, the leash interrupts their biological “flight” response, and doesn’t fully allow them to escape from the thing that’s upsetting them — which can causeeven more stress.\nHow to train a leash-reactive dog:\nThe goal of leash-reactivity training is to keep the dog below their threshold of frustration. This way, they can see the thing causing the reactivity without getting upset. You have to change their reaction to the stimuli, but you can only do that if you start their training at a safe distance away from the trigger.\nIf their reactivity is severe and prevents you or your dog from feeling comfortable on a walk, it is best to enlist the help of a trainer ASAP. While training, whether on your own or with a trainer, you want to work up to distances that are closer to the stimuli. Reward them with a treat often, especially as you near the problem.\nEventually, your pup should exhibit fewer stress signals as they near their trigger. An important note: Don’t rush. Each dog will go at their own pace. If you see your dog exhibiting signs of stress or frustration, then you’ve moved too quickly and are expecting more from them than they can handle. Back off, and try again at a farther distance. Keep up your training routine as long as you need until their previous trigger is no longer bothering them.\nP.S.Neveruse aretractable leash. They offer zero control and often jam, putting your pet (and any others within 20 feet) at risk.",

  },
  "page_content": "At some point in your dog’s life — probably sooner than later — you’ll notice them chewing on a stick. Chewing on non-food items is fairly normal, instinctive behavior, especially for puppies (cue a lament for your favorite pair of Birkenstocks). It keeps dogs busy and helps them expend energy.\nMore specifically, dogs may chew on sticks when teething, bored, seeking attention, or suffering a nutritional deficiency. However, this behavior isn’t safe and veers into dangerous territory when your puppy or dog startseatingsticks.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nMichelle Baker, founder of, and dog behavior specialist at,Furkids Inc. (a canine daycare and enrichment center), says that although your dog carrying the occasional stick might seem harmless, the reality is that sticks can pose serious medical risks. “Sharp edges can puncture gums. Splinters can get lodged in the throat,” Baker says. “And if swallowed, pieces of wood can cause intestinal blockages or internal injuries.”\nThis is why it’s important to understand the reason behind why your dog is eating sticks. Once you determine the cause, you can find ways to redirect the behavior towards something less dangerous.\nCan dogs eat sticks?\nMost dogs can and will eat sticks. Butshouldthey? No. Eating sticks can lead to serious issues, such as internal injuries and intestinal blockages. The good news is that once you identify the reason why your dog is exhibiting this potentially dangerous behavior, you can learn how to discourage it.\nWhy they shouldn’t make a DIY chew toy out of the stuff in your yard.\n5 reasons why your dog is eating sticks\nPuppies exploring their environment will eat sticks and other non-food items (such as dirtand rocks) out of curiosity. To most dogs, the shape and texture of sticks mimic bones and toys. “Dogs explore the world with their eyes, nose, and — most importantly — their mouths,” Baker says. “Sticks, being conveniently scattered across yards and parks, make for easy-to-grab natural toys that many dogs find irresistible. Not only do they provide an outlet for play, but chewing can also help relieve anxiety. Whether it’s a teething five-month-old puppy or a senior dog stressed out by the neighbor’s home renovation project, chewing on a stick can feel like a form of self-soothing.”\nTeething puppies, in particular, enjoy the texture of sticks to soothe their aching gums. From six weeks to six months of age, puppies slowly lose their baby teeth as their permanent teeth start erupting. The process causes discomfort and pain, which triggers their instinct to chew on anything they find.\nColby Julien — a puppy parent, dog behaviorist, and dog trainer atGeo-Sniffing(an interactive scent-pod discovery game for dogs) — says that between teething and exploration, puppies seem to put everything in their mouths. “Instead of chasing or forcibly removing the stick, which can lead toresource guarding, you can redirect their attention with something more interesting,” she says.\nBored dogswill find their own fun, which might not be fun for you. “Dogs who lack mental stimulation often seek their own entertainment, and sometimes that means making sticks their chew toy of choice,” Baker says. “Take a look at your pup’s enrichment routine. Are they engaging in interactive play, puzzle feeders, or snuffle mats? If mealtime consists of a basic food bowl and nothing else, switching to more engaging alternatives could curb their urge to turn the backyard into a buffet of bark and branches.”\nIf your dog figures out that you’ll run over and start playing tug-of-war when they start chewing on a stick — well, game on. To avoid reinforcing this attention-seeking behavior, try responding as calmly as possible. Dogs arenatural scavengersand will return from a foray into the woods proudly carrying their latest trophy.\nYour pup may be trying to find something they need in that stick. Poor-quality commercial dog food often contains artificial, non-essential ingredients that can lead to a nutritional deficiency. Homemade diets and an excess of treats can also cause nutrient and mineral imbalances, leading dogs to eat non-food items, a condition called pica. The best way to find out if your dog has a nutritional deficiency is through blood work.\nBrb, running out to buy air plants and succulents.\nIs it safe for dogs to eat and chew on sticks?\nIt’s never safe for dogs to chew on sticks. Whatever the reason, dogs andpuppies should not chew on sticks. Splinters can cause oral lacerations, choking, intestinal trauma, and toxicity.\nHow to discourage your dog from eating sticks\nBaker says with a little training (and a few well-timed treat swaps), you can ensure that your pup enjoys their playtime without a potential emergency trip to the vet. Dogs learn that trading sticks for treats or toys is fun. “Encouraging safe chewing habits and offering engaging enrichment alternatives can help redirect your dog’s love for sticks in a safer direction,” she says. “Teaching a strong ‘leave it’ cue can also be a game-changer. This helps your dog learn to let sticks be — before they turn into a splintery snack.”\nSafe options for chewinginclude pigs’ ears and bully sticks. (A bully stick, in case, you didn’t know is a dried, cured bull’s penis.) Don’t give puppies anything as hard as abully stickuntil they’re at least six months old, because their gums are too sensitive. Avoid plastic bones, rawhide, and marrow bones for dogs of all ages.\nWhen you’re going to an area where your dog might find sticks, Julien advises carrying a toy that your puppy or dog gets only when they’re outside. For puppies, she says, “If you forget the toy, remember everything is novel, so even a leaf or an empty poop bag can redirect. Or call your other dog over to create a distraction. Puppies are easily distracted, so engaging them in play helps them drop the stick voluntarily.” Be patient — some puppies value sticks more than toys, so you may need to experiment with different distractions.\nCasually throw the toy far away. And stay calm, she says, because overreacting and reaching for your puppy’s mouth makes the stick a valuable resource. “The hardest part is to stay calm and not overreact. Vets will warn you of the dangers of ingestion, but behaviorists focus on preventing resource guarding,” Julien says. “Not only does grabbing an object make a puppy guard the object, but some might even swallow it. If the stick isn’t [capable of being swallowed], supervise calmly and redirect.”\nExercise is one of the best ways to ensure your dog will be tired enough to avoid temptation, whether the object is a stick or a pair of shoes. If you know that your dog chews on sticks to release energy and cure boredom, investing in more exercise is the best way to discourage your dog from chewing on sticks.\nBaker says some dogs carry objects in their mouths to manage nervous energy. “It’s their version of a stress ball except, in this case, the ‘ball’ happens to be a tree branch,” she says.\nJulien adds that puppies may also chew sticks because they’reoverstimulated. “Overstimulated puppies get extra mouthy, and chewing can be a sign they need a nap, not more activity,” she says. “Recognizing when your puppy needs rest can prevent unnecessary chewing.”\nBaker says if your pup has developed a serious attachment to sticks — one that borders on obsession — it’s time for an intervention. The best approach? A trade-off. “Offer a high-value treat in exchange for the stick, followed by an approved chew toy,” she says. “Praise them enthusiastically for making the swap because — let’s be honest — giving up a good stick is a big deal in the dog world.”\nWhat to do if your dog has eaten a stick\nIf you suspect your dog has swallowed a stick,do notwait it out. Seek emergency veterinary care immediately. “A lodged or sharp piece of wood could rupture the digestive tract, turning a minor chew session into a life-threatening emergency,” Baker says.\nBottom line\nChewing is a very normal, natural instinct for dogs, and sticks resemble objects we commonly give them such as store-bought bones, antlers, and bully sticks.\nChewing is a very normal, natural instinct for dogs, and sticks resemble objects we commonly give them such as store-bought bones, antlers, and bully sticks.\nDogs also chew and eat sticks because they’re bored, teething, seeking attention, or trying to satisfy a nutritional deficiency.\nDogs also chew and eat sticks because they’re bored, teething, seeking attention, or trying to satisfy a nutritional deficiency.\nFAQs\nChewing is a natural instinct for dogs.Chewing keeps dogs busy and uses energy.

You’ll only make the stick more enticing. Instead, ask your dog to trade the stick for a treat or toy.\nOur job as pet parents is to give our pups the safest items to satisfy their urge to chew. Make sure your dog has a balanced diet, and swap sticks and rocks for high-value treats and toys.\nEating non-food items is a condition called pica. It can stem from medical, behavioral, and psychological problems, or because of a nutritional deficiency in your dog’s diet. Other conditions that may lead dogs to eat rocks include canine diabetes, parasites, worms, or tumors. Puppies may eat rocks because they’re teething.\nReferences\nChew, Dogsee. “All about Puppy Chew Sticks for First-Time Dog Parents.”Dogseechew.in, Dogsee Chew, 31 Dec. 2020,www.dogseechew.in/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-puppy-chew-sticks-as-first-time-dog-parents.\nChew, Dogsee. “All about Puppy Chew Sticks for First-Time Dog Parents.”Dogseechew.in, Dogsee Chew, 31 Dec. 2020,www.dogseechew.in/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-puppy-chew-sticks-as-first-time-dog-parents.\nMelen, Alex. “The Real Reasons Why Dogs Like to Carry Sticks Home.” HUND Denmark, 29 Sept. 2022,hunddenmark.com/blogs/news/the-real-reasons-why-dogs-like-to-carry-sticks-home.\nMelen, Alex. “The Real Reasons Why Dogs Like to Carry Sticks Home.” HUND Denmark, 29 Sept. 2022,hunddenmark.com/blogs/news/the-real-reasons-why-dogs-like-to-carry-sticks-home.",

  "page_content": "Imagine your ordinarily sweet, affectionate pup suddenly growling at you over a food bowl, lunging at a stranger, or even biting a family member. It’s alarming, confusing, unacceptable, and heartbreaking. But before you panic, know this: Aggression doesn’t come out of nowhere.Sudden canine aggressionis almost always a symptom of an underlying issue, such as pain, fear, or an environmental shift.\nAggression isn’t about dominance or disobedience — it’s a form of communication. Your pup is telling you something is wrong, and it’s your job to figure out what that is. Whether a hidden injury, anxiety, or an unnoticed change in their world, uncovering the cause will help your dog feel safer while protecting those around them.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWhat causes aggression in dogs?\nAggression in dogs is often misunderstood. While some assume it’s a personality flaw or an issue of dominance, the reality is more complex. Dogs don’t snap for no reason. They respond to stimuli based on their physical and emotional states. Aggression can stem from pain, fear, learned behaviors, or sudden environmental changes. The key to addressing this isn’t punishment (never shout at an aggressive dog) but understanding thewhybehind the behavior.\nTurns out, even experts have a hard time defining these terms.\n6 common reasons for sudden aggression\nDogs are resilient, but that doesn’t mean they’re immune to pain. A hidden injury or an underlying medical condition can make even the most patient, loving dog irritable. Pain may be the culprit if they suddenly growl when touched or snap when approached. Conditions such as arthritis, dental infections, or even a thorn stuck in their paw can cause discomfort that manifests as anger and aggression.\nCertain medical conditions can alter your dog’s attitude and behavior. Neurological disorders, thyroid imbalances, or cognitive decline (in older dogs) can increase aggression.\nThough rare in vaccinated canines, rabies is a well-known illness that causes severe aggression. More commonly, conditions such as brain tumors or canine cognitive dysfunction (dog dementia) can make them more irritable and disoriented.\nAnxiety makes dogs nervous and reactive. If they feel threatened or overstimulated, their fight-or-flight response may tip them toward fight. Dogs with separation anxiety, noise phobias (like gunshots, fireworks, or thunderstorms), or past trauma are more prone tosudden aggressionwhen they feel overwhelmed or trapped.\nSide note: Rescue dogs often have past trauma from neglect, abuse, and mistreatment. Be cautious and go slowly when interacting with canines who could have a traumatizing history.\nDoes your dog suddenly growl when you approach their food bowl or a favorite toy? That’sresource guarding, a deeply ingrained survival instinct. Some dogs are naturally more protective of their possessions, while others develop this behavior due to insecurity or past experiences with scarcity.\nDogs thrive on routine. A significant disruption, such as moving to a new home, adding a new pet or baby to the household, or changing a pup’s schedule to accommodate a pet parent’s routine, can make them feel insecure. When dogs feel uncertain about their surroundings, they may react aggressively to regain control.\nAs dogs age, their patience thins. Cognitive decline, arthritis, or loss of sight and hearing can make them more irritable. A dog who once tolerated and loved rough petting and play may suddenly growl if they can’t see your hand coming or if their joints ache.\nItispowerful enough, even for the tough cases, and itisthe best choice—here’s why.\nWhat to do if your dog becomes aggressive\nBefore assuming that this is a behavioral issue, take your dog to the vet.Pain and medical conditionsare among the leading causes of sudden aggression, and a thorough checkup can rule out hidden health problems. Blood tests, X-rays, or neurological exams may be necessary to pinpoint the cause.\nKeep a log of your dog’s aggressive episodes.\nWhen do they happen?\nWhen do they happen?\nWhat was going on before and after?\nWhat was going on before and after?\nAre there common factors, such as a specific person, object, or time of day?\nAre there common factors, such as a specific person, object, or time of day?\nIdentifying triggers will help you understand if theiraggression stems from frustration, fear, or pain.\nIf your dog’s aggression persists, a certified canine behaviorist or a professional trainer can help. They’ll assess the pup’s body language, triggers, and environment to create a custom behavior-modification plan.\nAvoid trainers who rely on dominance-based techniques, because aggression begets aggression. Positive reinforcement is the gold standard for changing aggressive behaviors.\nHow to identify triggers for dog aggression\nPinpointingaggression triggersrequires close observation.\nBody language:Does your dog stiffen before growling? Do their ears go back when approached?\nBody language:Does your dog stiffen before growling? Do their ears go back when approached?\nContext:Are they aggressive only when eating?

Positive reinforcement is a more effective, humane training method.”\nLong-term strategies to prevent aggression\nTraining isn’t just about teaching commands. It fosters trust and clear communication between you and your canine companion. Awell-trained dogfeels more secure, reducing anxiety-driven aggression. Regular obedience strengthens their ability to handle stressors calmly and predictably, preventing reactive outbursts.\nConsistency is essential. Even short, daily training sessions reinforce positive behaviors and help dogs build impulse control over time.\nMany behavioral changes stem from underlying medical conditions that go unnoticed until they manifest as aggression and mood swings.\nRoutine vet visits can catch issues such as arthritis, dental disease, or thyroid imbalances before they can cause severe discomfort. Early detection and treatment of medical problems improve your dog’s quality of life, while preventing pain-induced aggression from escalating. A proactive approach to healthcare ensures behavioral concerns aren’t rooted in physical suffering, allowing for more effective management and training.\nHow to assess the risk of keeping an aggressive dog\nNot all aggressive dogs pose the same level of risk. Consider the following.\nSeverity and triggers:Is the aggression situational or unpredictable?\nSeverity and triggers:Is the aggression situational or unpredictable?\nManagement options:Can their environment be adjusted safely?\nManagement options:Can their environment be adjusted safely?\nProfessional input:A behaviorist can help assess long-term outcomes.\nProfessional input:A behaviorist can help assess long-term outcomes.\nIf a dog’s aggression is extreme and cannot be safely managed, difficult decisions may need to be made.\nMuzzles areoften misunderstood, but can be an essential safety tool for managing aggressive behavior. A well-fitted basket muzzle allows your pup to pant, drink, or take treats while preventing them from biting or attacking in stressful situations.\nIf your dog has shown aggression toward people or other animals, a muzzle will protect them as the dog undergoes training and behavior modification. However, a muzzle shouldn’t be a permanent solution or a substitute for addressing the root cause of aggression. When used correctly, it’s a temporary measure that keeps your dog and those around them safe, while they learn to navigate aggressive triggers.\nWhat to know about rehoming a dog for aggressive behavior\nRehoming a dog with aggression is a challenging, emotional decision. But in some cases, it may be the safest option for everyone involved.\nIf a dog’s behavior poses a risk to household members (especially children), or can’t be managed despite dedicated training and medical interventions, finding them a more suitable home may be the most responsible choice.\nFull transparency is vital when rehoming an aggressive dog. Potential adopters need to understand the risks and necessary management strategies. Breed-specific rescuers, trainers, or experienced handlers are better equipped to take in a dog with behavioral challenges than a general adoption shelter or everyday pet parent. Although rehoming should be a last resort, giving a dog a second chance in an environment better suited to their needsmust be done responsibly.\nBottom line\nA dog’ssudden shift towards aggressionis rarely random. This can be a symptom of pain, fear, anxiety, or an environmental change that has thrown them off balance.\nA dog’ssudden shift towards aggressionis rarely random.

  "page_content": "My dog, Willy, is a serious marker. He officiously patrols his territory and marks the same trees, bushes, and boulders most days. In the woods, he and his littermate Lilac mark on top of each other’s marks in an amusing game of one-upmanship.\nFortunately, Willy doesn’t have to be very polite about where he marks, because he’s surrounded by woods. I only discourage him from lifting a leg on my flower pots. He doesn’t mark in the house, but many dogs do — and many more live in areas where it’s not polite to lift their leg on the neighbor’s bushes. Un-neutered males are the biggest offenders, but spayed females (Lilac) and neutered males (Willy) mark as well.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nReversing this behavior often requires removing frequently marked objects, limiting your dog’s freedom to mark, and thoroughly cleaning marked spots to eliminate the smell of urine that encourages further marking. Watching your dog for signs they’re about to mark and discouraging them is another strategy to (ahem) curb this often unwanted behavior.\nWhat is marking?\nIt turns out that marking is a form of canine communication, like graffiti on a bathroom wall that declares, “Willy was here.” Dog pee contains pheromones, or chemical messages, that convey stats like gender, age, health, and reproductive status. Alicia Collins, founder-CEO atK9 Activity Club & Lodge, explains that marking is when dogs, both male and female, pee on things to communicate — rather than to relieve a full bladder. “All canine species, wild and domesticated, mark to convey information about identity, reproductive status, boundaries, and claimed territory,” Collins says.\nCelebrity dog trainerVictoria Stilwell on how to keep your dog from using your living room as a toilet.\nWhy do dogs mark territory?\nDogs mark territory mainly as a way to announce their presence and plant their flag. In polite terms, it’s like a canine calling card. Brett Reynolds, director of dog care forThe Dog Stopand a certified fear-free animal trainer, says that a dog may also mark due to the arrival of new family members, the presence of another dog, and reproductive readiness.\nWhen my son came home from the hospital 17 years ago, my first dog, Grendel, became very anxious and territorial. She didn’t begin marking in the house, but it wouldn’t have surprised me. Collins and Reynolds agree that a new baby or family member can lead to territorial marking. “Disturbances and disruptions to a familiar routine can result in behavioral marking,” Reynolds says.\nStress and separation anxiety can increase marking.Sally Grottini, an American Kennel Club evaluator/trainer and assistance/service dog trainer specializing in behavior, says urinating in the home, along with constant barking and whining, destructive behavior, defecation, and digging at the door are other signs of separation anxiety.\nCollins says if your dog is urinating more than usual, they may have a urinary tract infection (UTI). This leads to increased urination that mimics marking. Females are more susceptible to UTIs so that’s one clue. “Consult your veterinarian if your dog’s elimination patterns are unusual or seem painful,” Reynolds says. Some medications will make a dog drink more water, which can lead to increased urination.\nIntact male dogs are most likely to mark. But Reynolds says altered (spayed or neutered) dogs also exhibit urine marking.\nThink of marking as your dog’s dating app. It’s how they signal availability. “Other dogs can smell reproductive status,” Collins says.\nSince marking is the way a dog defines their territory, the presence of another dog can lead to increased marking. “Urine marking leaves a scent signature for other dogs in the area and can signal territorial boundaries,” Reynolds says.\nResearch shows that little dogs may feel the need to scent mark more frequently than big dogs.\nHow to stop dog marking\nMost dogs are housetrained by the time they reach adolescence and sexual maturity, when they’re anywhere from six to 12 months old. Ideally, if you’ve housetrained them yourself, they’ve equated peeing in the house with marking in the house. If an adult rescue dog comes into your life, however, it’s possible they haven’t learnednot to mark in the house.\nThis is where careful observation of your dog’s body language comes in. Marking is preceded by sniffing, during which time (a few seconds or longer) dogs gather information. Then, in preparation to mark, they’ll turn their bodies parallel to the target and lift their leg. The time to intervene with a firm verbal command is during the sniffing stage.\n“If you notice your dog marking, or better yet, sniffing surfaces preparatory to marking, you should interrupt and hurry them outside,” Reynolds says.\nCollins says spaying and neutering frequently reduce the desire to mark. But Reynolds adds that if marking is anestablishedbehavior pattern, removing sex hormones may not change the habit.\nScent is a strong trigger for marking. Adult dogs whopee in the housewill return to the same spot if it’s not cleaned. “Clean the space with a specialized cleaner that will eliminate the smell,” Collins advises.\nIf, after cleaning, your dog returns to the spot and indicates they’re going to mark, move quickly to re-associate the act with something appealing like a treat, a toy, or a trip outside.\nReynolds and Collins agree that restricting access to areas where your dog marks or removing marked items is a strategy to curb the behavior. Collins also advises using a leash to control where your dog can move around in the house.\nIf you think your dog is marking because their territory is threatened by a new family member, try to create positive associations with that person. If the person is old enough, have them give the dog treats. “This can take time — and maybe help from a professional — so the dog understands their place in the family,” Collins says.\nReynolds says adamantly that you should not punish your dog because you think you’re the pack leader and want to assert dominance. “The notion that humans must assert control to demonstrate their dominance is inaccurate and can be dangerous,” he says. “Punitive action causes additional stress and can increase marking behavior.”\nWhether you’re inside or outside, watch your dog for the prelude to marking, and try to stop them in the act. Sniffing is a sure sign they’re thinking of marking, or they need to pee. If you can’t watch them inside, confine them to a crate or a small room where they’re less likely to mark. “Using a firm ‘no,’ and a time-out if needed, can help prevent the dog from marking in the moment and in the future,” Collins says.\nBottom line\nMarking is a common behavior.\nMarking is a common behavior.\nIt is more common in male dogs, especially ones who haven’t been neutered.\nIt is more common in male dogs, especially ones who haven’t been neutered.\nTo stop a dog from marking a spot, instead of punishing them, redirect the behavior, or stop them and move them to a different location.\nTo stop a dog from marking a spot, instead of punishing them, redirect the behavior, or stop them and move them to a different location.\nFAQs\nWatch your dog for sniffing, during which time they’re gathering information, or “reading” any previous marks.Thisis the time to intervene with a firm verbal command and redirection. If they’re going to mark, they’ll turn their bodies parallel to the target and lift their leg.\nMarking is an instinct, so there should be times —  maybe when your dog is off leash in a grassy or wooded area — when they can mark freely.\nNo, that will damage your relationship with your dog and compromise the trust you need to train your dog not to mark.",

  "page_content": "You could practically hear it as you read this headline, couldn’t you? Ahigh-pitched howlstrong enough to shatter eardrums, followed by the insistent blaring of a thousand short, staccato barks. The noise warps time and space, making seconds feel like years. The longer your dog screeches, the more you begin to wonder,Is this ever going to end, or is this just my life now?\nRest assured, if your dog loves to bring the ruckus, you don’t have to live like this forever. But training your dog tostop barkingwill require technique, patience, and, more than anything, empathy. When our dogs bark, they’retrying to tell us something. It’s up to us to figure out what they’re feeling and how we can help.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nYoucantrain your dog to turn down the noise.\nWhen confronted with a particularly vocal dog, certified professional dog trainer Courtney Bayer always returns to the same mantra: Your dog isn’t trying to give you a hard time; your dog ishavinga hard time.“ I tend to tell myself that a lot,” Bayer says, “so I’m not taking it personally.\nIf you can feel the frustration building up, remember that your dog isn’ttryingto annoy you. Dosome deep breathingand try to redirect their focus. Bayer suggests physically moving the dog somewhere else to reset their brains and give them something better to do. In the long run, you’ll want to come up with a plan to limit your dog’s triggers and train them to channel their feelings another way.\nTraining is never a one-and-done solution. Certaintips and tricksmight help, but at some point, you’ll likely find yourself right back where you started, plugging your ears and resisting the urge to pull your hair out. Whenever impatience sets in, Bayer suggests thinking of your dog like a toddler who’s trying to express big feelings but can’t find the words. “It kind of puts you in a better mindset than, ‘Oh, my dog is embarrassing and making me frustrated and angry,’” she says.\nThat framing can help you better manage the task at hand: figuring out what’sfreaking your dog out, and then, how to fix it. Bayer has a handy acronym for this process: “M.E.A.T.”\nManagementmeans working with the environment to eliminate stimuli.

This will be a learning process for both of you. Find other people who are dealing with the same thing, either within your local community, in a training class, or online. These groups can be a vital source of communal support as you all find one-on-one time to work with your dogs. “It doesn’t have to be specific to barking,” Bayer says. “It helps with bonding. Training will go faster.”\nDepending on why your dog barks, your training process may vary.\nWhy is my dog barking?\nWant your dog to bark less? Start by figuring out why they are barking in the first place. Then, you can address their emotional needs.\nThese are the kinds of barks that catch us off guard when we’re on an important Zoom call and themail carrierarrives. Some dogs see themselves as the protector of the house, and they take that job very,veryseriously — no matter what else we might have going on. If you want them to bark less, try thanking them for their services.\nNo, seriously. Consider “thank you” as a training cue to let your dog know they’ve done a good job and can stand down. Bayer suggests using a warm tone — something like, “Thank youfor letting me know the UPS guy is here!” Then, you can reward them for coming away from the window or door and engaging with you.\n“Anecdotally, I feel like that helps them feel recognized,” Bayer says. “Like, ‘OK, I’m doing my job, and I’m getting rewarded for it, but I don’t have to continuously bark and lunge at the window.’” If your dog is barking out of fear (say, of other dogs), trydesensitization training.\nIf your dog isbarking out of boredom, that’s on you to fix. “If they’re bored, that means they’re not getting enough exercise and enrichment,” Bayer says. When your dog starts, say, barking in the yard after sitting outside for a few hours, punishment is not the appropriate response. Instead, step up your pet-parenting game and engage with them in a constructive activity, likeexercise or playtime.\nThis one, Bayer admits, is “everyone’s least favorite.” Your dog wants something and will stop at nothing until they get it. Unfortunately, rewarding this behavior by giving them whatever they want all but guarantees they do it again.\n“You have to take away what the dog wants, which is eye contact, touch, speech, or whatever you’re holding,” Bayer says. “Remove yourself, like a reverse timeout.”\nFair warning: If you try this, your dog will likely resort to an “extinction burst,” barking even more in a desperate Hail Mary. Usually, Bayer says, “that’s when people give up or give in, and they say the training isn’t working.” But if you stick to your guns and push through this stage and occasionally reward your dog for his silence, you’ll get the behavior you want.\nThis one’s similar to demand barking, Bayer says, except that in these cases, your dog is focused on something other than you. Maybe they want to play with one of their dog friends on the other side of the fence, or they lost a toy under the couch. Whatever it is, they want it and can’t get to it.\nIn these cases, Bayer says, you’ll want to withhold your assistance much like you would with a demanding dog. Train your dog to come to you for help instead of barking at thesource of their frustration.\nWhen should I see a vet?\nIf your dog barks out ofseparation anxiety— meaning, they essentially have a panic attack any time you leave the house or a room— speak to a vet as soon as possible. In these cases, training alone is often not enough. “There almost always has to be some kind of medical intervention if it’s true separation anxiety and not just boredom,” Bayer says.\nAs mind-numbing as barking can be, the right solutions will bring you and your dog closer than ever. And if you and your pup ever need a break, there’s alwaysdog yoga.",

  "page_content": "People are given all sorts of advice that experts disagree with. Thanks to the ease of sharing information in the age of social media, the bad ideas spread quickly, gaining traction with alarming ease.\nThis problem is hardly unique to the dog world. In fact, lies rampage over the truth in a variety of fields. A few weeks ago, my stylist debunked some myths I’d believed about keeping my hair healthy (apparently you can brush your hairtoomuch!), and a bicycle mechanic told me what I was doing to keep my bike in good shape was actually hurting it (apparently you can put too much oil on your bike chain, too!).\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nSo, now that I’ve had some people course-correct me on a couple of things in my life, I felt maybe I should do the same for dog parents. Here are seven lies that are often shared about dog behavior.\nYou should reach your hand out when meeting a dog for the first time.\nIt’s not a good idea to advise people that this is the perfect way to act around any dog. If you do this to a friendly, sociable dog, they will likely sniff you and happily move on to the next stage of getting to know you. But reaching your hand out to greet a pup is a great way to upset them — and possibly get a bite to the hand (or worse).Showing your hand to afearful dogwill probably make them more afraid. It’s threatening and unpleasant for them and can make their fear of people worse. Even more alarming: Most dogs who are aggressive act this way because they are afraid. Do not give a dog a reason to bite your hand.\nThe best thing you can do when meeting a dog is to let them approach you. Stand still (not rigidly—stay relaxed!) with your arms at your side, then turn a little to the side with your weight shifted to the leg further away from the dog. If the dog comes up to you, great! If they don't, let them be. If they do choose to come, it is much more likely to be a safe and enjoyable experience for all when you pet them.\nDog's like when you pet them on the top of the head.\nSure, many dogs tolerate it without doing anything, but they still probably are not really into it. Don’t believe me? Watch people with their dogs, and notice how often pups try to get away or dodge the hand reaching over their head to pet it.\nMost dogs will politely let you know that they are not enjoying it, but it’s a good idea for humans to cut it out and pet dogs where they enjoy it. Most oftenthey enjoy petson the chest, behind the ears, or on the back at the base of the tail.\nYou can see the guilt on your dog’s face.\nSo many people say their dog acts guilty in certain situations — when they come home and see missing food or a wrapper on the floor. But we know from scientific research that pups maylookshameful, but that isn’t necessarilywhat they are feeling.\nIn a2015 study, researchers looked at nearly 100 dogs and their people; the pet parents were instructed to forbid their dog from eating a piece of ham and then leave the room. Then an experimenter either picked up the ham or left it for the dog to eat. The returning pet parent had no way of knowing whether their dog ate the ham. And per the study, they could not tell, based on their dog’s expression, whether they felt guilty.\nDogs are acting “guilty” when their people scold them, not when they have eaten something they shouldn’t. The guilty look is an attempt to appease their people and has nothing to do with their behavior.\nA tail wag always means a dog is friendly.\nSadly, it is not this simple. The most accurateinterpretation of a tail wagisnotthat the dog is friendly, but that the they are willing to interact. Friendly dogs are certainly willing to interact, and they wag their tails. But there are unfriendly ways of interacting, and dogs with these intentions also wag their tails. The details of the tail wag can tell you more about whether it’s is a friendly one.\nIf your dog’s full body (or at least their whole backside) is moving while they wag their tail, they are more likely to be friendly. The same is true if the pup’s tail moves fast, while remaining fluid and flexible. If the tail rotates in a circle starting at the base, this is also a sign of friendliness. In contrast, if you see a pup do a slow, stiff tail wag — perhaps only the tip of the tail is wagging — this is a warning, especially if the rest of their body is also stiff. These days, more people know that a wagging tail does not always equal a friendly dog. But I still regularly have clients who say, “I can’t believe they bit someone; they were wagging their tail!”\nYou can’t teach an old dog new tricks.\nHappily, this is not true at all. Dogs remain flexible in their behavior throughout their lives and can always learn new skills. There isnoage limit on training a dog, and many pups continue to learndeep into their golden years.\nWhile age itself does not interfere with dogs learning something new, conditions that are often associated with aging may be a problem. If a dog is old enough to haveorthopedic issues, for example, they may resist certain actions because they are painful for them. Similarly, if they experiencesevere cognitive decline, they will struggle to learn. Otherwise, they can be excellent students no matter how gray their muzzles are.\nYou don’t need to walk your dog if they are out in the yard a lot.\nIt’s a mistake to assume your dog is running around and getting the exercise they need when alone in the yard. Dogs just don’t tend to do that. They might run a little along the fence or race out into the yard when you first open the door, but mostly they lie around orwalk slowly and sniff.\nDogs don’t tend to exercise themselves. Also, part of what a walk provides (for dogs who can handle them and benefit from them) isenrichment in the formof stimulating sights, sounds, smells, and social encounters. Your dog misses these benefits if they are not given theopportunity to explorebeyond their own fences.\nTheir poor behavior is your fault.\nThis lie has caused so much pain to many good people who have dogs with less-than-ideal behavior.Of coursehow we raise our dogs influences who they become and how they behave, but it’s not the only thing that does.\nTheir genetics are hugely influential. They may be naturally shy, tend to be afraid of anything new, react strongly to loud noises, or have such a high energy level that giving them adequate exercise is a Sisyphean task. Also, we can’t control everything that happens to them, and one traumatic incident out of our control can derail a lot of dogs, no matter how skillfully we train them.\nAnother issue is their health. If a dog suffers from a bad health incident, that can have a big influence on them, especially if it happens at a young age, and they miss out on some important experiences. This lie, sometimes alternatively phrased as, “there are no bad dogs, only bad people,” is so prevalent that it’s one of the most common comments I hear from people when they learn what I do for a living. I find myself constantly telling people that many of my clients have raised two, five, eight, or even 11 dogs. But they are only calling me about one of these dogs, which tells me it isn’t about them.\nReferences\nOstojić, Ljerka, et al. “Are Owners’ Reports of Their Dogs’ “Guilty Look” Influenced by the Dogs’ Action and Evidence of the Misdeed?”Behavioural Processes, vol. 111, Feb. 2015, pp. 97–100,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2014.12.010.\nOstojić, Ljerka, et al. “Are Owners’ Reports of Their Dogs’ “Guilty Look” Influenced by the Dogs’ Action and Evidence of the Misdeed?”Behavioural Processes, vol. 111, Feb. 2015, pp. 97–100,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2014.12.010.",

  "page_content": "More often than not, being a dog parent means trying to decode some seriously strange behavior: Why is my dogstaring so intentlyat that empty corner in the living room? Why are theylicking their pawsso much? And why can’tthey stop humpingthat one specific friend of mine? Some mysteries are more frustrating than others — and some are loud enough that you’ll want to solve them sooner than later.\nFor instance, does your dog sometimes bark over and over again in exactly the same way? Same pitch, same intonation, same cadence? To coin a word, this behavior could be called a barkpeat. Get it? Like repeating but, you know, barking.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nSo, are they barking out the same phrase in dog-speak, like a toddler might monotonously yell, “Mom, mom, mom, mom” when asking for a snack? Does it mean something specific? To get to the bottom of the baying, I asked two experts to share everything they know about canine vocalizations.\nWhy do dogs bark the same way over and over again?\nActually, they may be repeating the same sound because they are, indeed, asking for a very specific thing; it’s likely they’re trying to communicate something important. The reasons might vary, but if your dog is barking up a symphony, it’s best to pay attention,” says Ann Allums Vest, certified professional dog trainer and owner ofAnnie The Dog Nanny.\nThat’s where context clues andbody languagecome in. Assess your dog’s posture, pitch, and surroundings to determine which kind of barking you’re hearing. That way, you can respond accordingly.\n“When we do not respond to a dog who is communicating a need or concern, the dog will continue to vocalize,” Vest says. “For example, when the doorbell rings, a dog may continue alert barking until the person goes away or until the dog decides the person at the door is not a threat.”\nSome breeds might also make specific vocalizations of their own, says Alexandra Calgut, certified behaviorist and owner ofTraining That Stays. Beagles and other Hounds, for instance, arebred to bay, letting their parents know where they are — a behavior that can seep into other aspects of daily life. “When we start to distinguish what each kind of sound may mean, we start having a better understanding of what our dogs’ needs are,” she says.\nWhy do dogs bark in the first place?\nUsually, dogs bark because they're excited, alert, bored, or demanding something. Behaviorist Tressa Fesseden-McKenziewrote for Kinshipthat “barking is one of the trickiest behaviors to decode. And that’s a problem, because it’s not only irritating; it can also be an indication that something is not quite right with your pal.” (Even if that something is just that they need your attention and love.)\nBarking doesn’t always have to be a bad thing; it’s also how ourdogs express joy. Per Vest, dogs sometimes bark at us or other dogs to initiate playtime. If your dog is already at play and letting out a few yaps, they are probably having a blast.\nHappy barking isn’t only about playtime. Sometimes, it’s about you. “You mayhave excitement barkingwhen returning home from work and your dog is super excited,” Vest says.\nDog parents know better than anyone that our precious babies can also make great alarm systems. Weird noise in the apartment hallway? They’re on it. Mailman walking down the street? Have mercy! If anything out of the ordinary is happening, they’ll let us know. Relatedly, if something scares your dog, they might bark at it as a defensive tactic.\nBoredom barkingcan startwhen a dog is left alone for long periodswith no enrichment,” Vest says. If your dog spends eight hours waiting for you to come home from work with nomid-afternoon walkor playtime, you might hear them express that frustration vocally.\nIf your dog is dying for attention, treats, or a toy, they might let you know by barking. If you deny their pleas, there’s a good chance they’ll howl even more. Trainingcan help weanthem off this behavior, but be warned: The barking might get worse before it gets better.\nWhat do different barks mean?\nStruggling to figure out what emotion your dog is trying to convey? The pitch of their barks could provide some clues. “Context is key when it comes to understanding what the different bark can mean,” Calgut says. “High-pitch barks can mean the dog is excited over the toy it’s playing with, or it’s frustrated because the toy is stuck under the couch. Deeper barks can mean the dog is uneasy. It could also mean the dog is in aprotective mood.”\nVest agrees that high-pitched barking signifies either excitement and friendliness, anxiety, or fear. Lower-pitched sounds, on the other hand, could be a warning. If you’re not sure which emotion your dog is trying to convey, a quick look at theirbody languagecan help.\n“I think by listening to a dog’s barking while also observing the dog’s body language and the situation, we can deduce what emotions the dog may be feeling,” Vest says. “I refer toAlexandra Horowitz’s bookInside of a Dogfor ascientific overviewof dog vocalizations. She studies pet dogs at her dog cognition lab at Barnard College.”\nOnce you’ve determined what feeling your dog is trying to express, you can begin looking for ways to help resolve it.\nWhat to do if your dog won’t stop barking\nOnce you’ve determined why your dog can’t stop barking, you can start coming up with solutions that address their underlying emotions. “If your dog is barking at the dooras well as whimpering, that may be a sign he needs to go out,” Calgut says. “If your dog is barking out the window at a squirrel or the mailman, the key is redirection.”\nFor alert barking, Vest suggests, a simple “thank you” might suffice. “At my house, the dogs will bark a few times when they hear the doorbell, and I have taught them that I say, ‘Thank you’ and reward them with treats, so basically they did their job of alerting me, and they can stop barking now,” Vest says. “Since I addressed the dogs’ concerns and added something good (a treat), the barking doesn’t continue over and over.”\nIf gratitude doesn’t work, you can also try removing the stimulus for alert barking by closing the curtains or mitigating outside noise.\nIf your dog ishowling with excitement, Vest suggests modeling the behavior you wish to see in your dog. If you want them to calm down, be calm yourself (they cansmell your stress,after all). Instead of yelling, “No” or “Stop,” which your dog will construe as you barking with them, sit down andstroke them calmly. Put sometreats on the groundto redirect their attention. In other words, create a soothing environment.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, boredom barking comes from a need for stimulation. In those cases, Vest says, “I address the dog’sneed for enrichment and attention.” Give them some love, pull out a toy, or find a way togive them some exercise— whatever gets your dog’s gears happily turning again.\nDemand barking, on the other hand, requires some serious patience. The best course of action is to ignore the noise, even when your dog inevitably starts barking louder. Offer occasional rewards when the barking stops for a period of time.\nAs for play barking, Vest says, “I may encourage my dog to pick up a toy, or I may gently interrupt the play session until the barking ceases and then let them resume playing.”\nWhen should I see a trainer or a vet?\nIf your dog’s behavior begins to escalate, Calgut suggests seeking help. If the barkingbecomes disruptiveto yourself or neighbors, check in with your vet to ensure there areno underlying medicaloranxiety issues. Then, you can begin looking into a rewards-based trainer who can come up with an appropriate behavior-modification plan.",

  "page_content": "Pica is a disorder that causes dogs to eat non-food items. (Yes, it does exist outside of that episode ofGrey’s Anatomyyou watched.) Though most dog parents have experienced their pup chewing on and eating random items to some degree — especially with puppies and younger dogs — pica is a more consistent, long-lasting behavior.\nWhile it can get annoying, pica can also put your dog at risk for health complications, depending on what they eat. So, if you’re finding more and more unmatched socks or squeaker-less toys, it is important to see a veterinarian to figure out what’s causing this eating behavior so you can start treating it.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWhat is pica?\nPica is a condition in which dogs repeatedly eat non-edible items that do not benefit them. A dog with pica disorder may ingest anything from rocks to fabric to drywall to dirt — and everything else they can get their paws on.\nSome dogs may do this once, or just occasionally, and that does not qualify as having pica. But dogs with pica will do this frequently and cannot be easily redirected or deterred from the behavior. This can be a frustrating condition for pet parents to manage, because these behaviors become destructive when dogs eat things of value around the home. More importantly, they also put dogs at risk for dangerous complications, which incur unexpected and very expensiveemergency vet visits.\nThere are many underlying causes for pica, so it’s important to see your vet if you notice your dog continuing to eat non-food items. The sooner you and your vet can figure out the underlying cause and start the right treatment, the better the outcome for your dog, your shoe collection, and your relationship with your pup.\nHow to get your pet to stop chewing on inedibles from clothes to couches.\nWhat are the causes of pica in dogs?\nCauses of pica in dogs include both medical and behavioral conditions. Your vet can help you distinguish between the two of them.\nInflammation in the digestive tract — brought on by things likeintestinal parasites, food allergies,exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), andprotein-losing enteropathy— can interfere with the absorption of nutrients, which can lead to pica. Along those same lines, vitamin and mineral deficiencies in a dog’s diet may also be to blame. This includes vitamin B12,as well as anemiaor low red-blood-cell counts.\nPica can also arise frombehavioral conditions, such as anxiety, compulsive disorder, and/or boredom. This can only be confirmed after medical causes are ruled out with a thorough diagnostic evaluation.\nWhat are the symptoms of pica in dogs?\nSigns of pica in dogs may vary, depending on the underlying cause of their condition. The main symptom, which defines the condition, is continuously eating non-food items. Dogs with pica oftenvomit as well, but it’s usually difficult to determine if this is theresultof eating foreign material, versus part of the underlying cause.\nOther symptoms can lend clues to the underlying cause, so it is a good idea to keep track of any other behavioral or physical abnormalities you notice with your dog. This can help your vet put together a complete picture of your dog’s condition and focus on the most likely causes and effective treatments.\nHow do veterinarians diagnose pica in dogs?\nDiagnosing pica in dogs takes patience because there are many possible causes to work through.Your vet will startby taking a thorough history to understand the nature of the behavior and then performing a complete physical exam. From there, blood work and imaging may be done to get a look at the digestive tract and organ function. More in-depth cases may require a biopsy of the digestive tract for further analysis.\nIf all of the test results are normal, there is likely a behavioral cause for pica. A veterinarian and/or veterinary behaviorist can help you to determine which behaviors are causing the pica, based on observations and a behavioral evaluation.\nWhat are the treatment options for pica in dogs?\nTreatment for pica in dogs is largely determined by the underlying cause, so it is very important to trudge through all of the trips to the vet and all of the diagnostic tests to get an accurate picture of what’s going on with your pup.\nIf your vet discovers an underlying medical condition, it will likely be treated with medication and/or a special diet to help resolve your dog’s desire to eat foreign objects. If your vet determines that your dog’s pica is behavioral, treatment may involve a combination ofbehavior modification techniques, mental enrichment, and medications. It’s important to have a thorough behavioral analysis performed by your vet and/or a veterinary behaviorist to understand if your dog’s behavior is related to anxiety, compulsive disorder, or boredom.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nAre there natural remedies for managing pica in dogs?\nPica results from a serious, underlying medical or behavioral condition, so home remedies alone are not sufficient to treat or cure the condition. These cases need aggressive treatment to prevent serious complications. However, it is helpful to complement medical treatments with some of the below home remedies for pica in dogs.\nAll homes should bedog-proofedto some degree. If you live with a dog who has pica, you’ll have to be even more vigilant about keeping temptation out of reach. Be especially mindful of removing objects that may be toxic if consumed, such as cleaning supplies,toxic plants, human medications, andcertain foods. Considercrate-trainingyour dog and/or blocking off parts of your home so they can roam safely.\nDogs who have repeatedly eaten foreign objects can be trained to comfortablywear a basket muzzle, which prevents them from eating things but is not snug around their mouth. This way they can still pant, take treats from you, drink water, and wear the muzzle comfortably.\nYou should use positive reinforcement (like treats and praise) to train dogs to wear it, so it is associated with good things and not seen as a punishment. The basket muzzle can be a lifesaving tool to keep them safe when you can’t completely dog-proof their environment, such ason walks, or when they are unsupervised for short periods.\nBecause some dogs have digestive problems that cause their pica, they maybenefit from probiotics. Probiotics provide live strains of beneficial microbes to the gut and can help with some digestive conditions. Probiotics alone cannot cure the conditions that lead to pica, so it is important to work with your vet to get the best treatment plan in place for your dog.\nAll dogs need to get enoughdaily exerciseto stay mentally and physically fit. This is especially important for dogs with certain behavioral conditions, including those that may cause pica. Some dogs will need an hour or more of intense activity, depending on their needs, so be sure you are keeping up. Whether it is an early morning run, daily walks with a dog walker,doggie daycare, or a post-work play session, you will see a big difference in your pup when they are getting enough exercise.\nAll dogs needmental enrichment, and dogs who have pica due to behavioral issues may need additional challenges throughout their day to keep their minds busy. This can include training sessions,interactive toys, puzzle feeders, obstacle courses, and more. If you need ideas on what will be best for your pup, consult a trainer or behaviorist who is familiar with pica.\nSome dogs with pica may need a special prescription diet to treat their underlying medical conditions, so be sure to consult with your vet before changing your dog’s diet. If your dog is not on a special diet, they may benefit from small, frequent meals throughout the day. It can also help to use aslow feederand/or different puzzle feeders to make meals last longer and provide mental enrichment at the same time.\nAre dogs able to recover from pica?\nYou may be wondering how to cure pica and what the likelihood is of a complete recovery. This depends largely on the underlying cause of their condition. In cases where a clear medical cause is diagnosed and dogs are successfully treated, their signs of pica should completely resolve.\nFor dogs who have behavioral causes driving their pica, long-term management is usually more realistic than a complete cure, though it depends on the specific dog and their condition. A dog’s best chance of successful recovery and/or cure depends on an accurate diagnosis and pursuing the most aggressive, consistent treatment.\nAll dogs with pica will also benefit from preventative strategies aimed at keeping them safe and keeping foreign objects out of reach. This helps avoid the serious consequences of eating objects that could be toxic or causeintestinal obstructions. The more proactive pet parents can be with treatment and preventative strategies, the better chance a dog with pica has for recovery and a long, happy life with their family.\nBottom line\nPica is a condition where dogs consistently eat non-food items. This means more than once or twice — it’s a constant issue.\nPica is a condition where dogs consistently eat non-food items.

  "page_content": "When we are little, we’re taught during potty training that it’s frowned upon to pee or poop outside of a toilet. When our dogs are potty trained, they may learn that they need to go outside, but they don’t necessarily always learn not to mark their territory (inside the house or out). If you are still dealing with a dog who marks things they shouldn’t, there is a way to make it stop. Learn more here.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWhy do dogs mark their territory?\nTo dogs, marking is a natural behavior. Territorial marking allows your dog to set boundaries in their area. Marking also provides a lot of information to other dogs. The scent can give information about their age, sex, altered/ unaltered, healthy/sick etc. Unfortunately, marking can be a nuisance behavior to humans depending on where or when your dog is doing it. Many factors may cause your dog to mark. Finding out why your dog is marking can help you put an end to the behavior.\nHaving visitors in your home may cause your dog to mark furniture. This change to your dog's environment may create anxiety or stress for your dog. New visitors may also bring different scents into the homes of other animals. Your dog may not like having their environment disrupted by a new visitor, especially one who smells like other dogs. Your dog may begin to mark territory to show that it is theirs.\nDid your visitors bring another animal with them? When bringing another dog into your home, it is always a good idea to meet outside on neutral territory. I like to take mydogs on a walk with new dogs. I do not allow them to meet initially. We walk with enough distance that they can see each other but can not reach each other. I let one go first, and then the other follows, sniffing where that dog walked/ marked. Then, we switch positions and allow the other dog to walk first. This allows the dogs to get to know each other’s scent before meeting.\nAs the walk goes on, the dogs should get looser body language and become more calm walking near a new dog. It is best to let dogs meet on a loose leash, not a tight one. I recommend using a long line in this situation (be sure you are holding the end in case you need to separate the dogs).\nIs your dog altered or unaltered? Dogs that have not beenspayed or neuteredmay be more likely to mark territory. These unaltered dogs may have a stronger sense of territorial behavior that comes along with the hormones from still being intact.\nMale and female dogs can mark, but male dogs are more likely to do so. Talk to your vet when would be the best time to spay/neuter your dog. Dogs can be spayed/neutered at any time, but as they get older, there are more chances of complications. If you spay/neuter around six months, your dog may stop some territorial marking once they are healed. Spaying and neutering does not always help; it depends on the reason your dog is marking.\nDogs thrive off stability and routine. A change in routine or their environment can cause anxiety or stress for your dog, which may cause them to begin marking. Environmental changes can be anything that causes your pup undue discomfort moving furniture around, moving to a new home, construction work happening outside, a new animal moving in next door, switching their food, etc.\nIf there is an environmental change, like moving, try to keep your dog’s routine the same — walk them and feed them at the same time. If you are starting a new job with different or longer hours, have someone come walk them when you normally would. Forloud noises, you can play a sound machine to help drown out the sound. If you are bringing new furniture into the house, block it off from your dog for the time being. As you sit on the furniture, it will get your scent on it. Then you can slowly introduce it to your dog under supervision.\nIf you notice unusual marking and think your dog is stressed, seek the assistance of your veterinarian right away. Could there be an animal taunting your dog from the window? Did youadd a new babyor pet to the home? Do your best to observe your dog. Are you noticing them acting any differently? When is the marking happening? What happened right before they marked? Is it always happening when you are out of the house? Stress can be detrimental to dogs, and trying to get your dog help right away is best. Your veterinarian will be able to point you in the right direction for treatment.\nCertain breeds are more likely to mark than others. Dogs who are bred to use their nose for hunting, like Beagles, may be more prone to marking. It is always best to do your research before bringing a dog home. Looking into certain breeds and learning about them will help you pick the best companion to spend your life with.\nAny unusual accidents are a red flag to bring your dog to the vet. Other red flags: if you notice your dog going pee more frequently, the urine has a funky smell, or they are marking or having accidents in the house. These unusual  habits are cause for concern. Your dog may have an issue with their kidneys,a UTI, diabetes, bladder stones etc. Your vet will be able to do tests to help pinpoint any issues and help treat your dog.\nCelebrity dog trainerVictoria Stilwell on how to keep your dog from using your living room as a toilet.\nDog marking vs. peeing: How to tell the difference\nTypically, the main difference between marking and peeing is the amount. If a dog is going pee, there will be a significant amount of urine because they are emptying their bladder. If a dog is marking, there will be a small amount of pee.\nHow to stop a dog from marking?\nStopping a dog from marking in the house is a difficult task, but it can be done with patience. First, you will need to figure out why your dog is marking. Illness, stress, environmental changes, or breed can be some of the reasons. Very young puppies will not mark because they do not have the hormones in their body that tell their bodies to mark yet. If you have a very young puppy who is peeing in the house, they are more likely not potty trained, and you will want to start potty-training techniques.\nNeutering or spaying your dog can help with territorial marking. If you have a dog under a year old, spaying or neutering should help decrease the marking behavior. Once your dog is fixed, it may take a month or so to see the results. If yourdog is olderand has spent many years of their life marking, spaying and neutering may not help. It is dependent on the dog and the reason they are marking.\nTakescent walks. They are a great way to encourage your dog to mark in appropriate places. Allowing your dog to fulfill natural dog behaviors in an appropriate way will help prevent them from repeating behaviors in an unwanted way. On a scent walk, you allow your pup to mark and sniff wherever they want. Not only does this type of walk allow them to mark, it allows them to engage in their natural searching behaviors, which will tire out their brains.\nAllowing more frequent pee breaks can help prevent some marking, especially if it is due to an illness. Observe your dog when they are peeing outside. That way, you know if they went, can see if they are straining, or check if the pee is discolored or smells unusual.\nCleaning the area where marking happened is extremely important. Whenusing a cleaner, be sure to use something that is ammonia free. Urine contains ammonia, so if you use a cleaner with ammonia, the spot will continue to smell, which tells your dog to continue to mark there. Be sure to treat any carpets and do your best to get rid of all of the urine. Blot up as much liquid as you can before treating it with a cleaning solution.\nIt is always important for a dog to becrate-trained. Crates are a great way to keep your house and your dog safe. If your dog ever has to spend any time at the vet, they will need to be in a crate. If your dog is not crate-trained, this will be another added stressor.\nIf your dog is already comfortable with being in a crate it will help them feel more comfortable while at the vet. Crate-training is also a great way to prevent unwanted accidents. Dogs do not typically pee where they sleep, so most dogs do not pee in their crates. If your dog is having accidents, placing them in the crate when you can not keep an eye on them will prevent them from peeing.\nSeriously, when will itend?\nFAQs\nBegin bytaking your puppy outsideevery 30 minutes. Each time they pee, reward them with a yummy treat. Be sure to take your puppy to the bathroom five to 10 minutes after eating, playing, or sleeping (outside of taking them out on their 30-minute schedule). If your puppy has an accident, do not punish them for it. Just clean it up and move on. If you catch your puppy in the middle of peeing inside, stop them and take them right out to their potty area.\nBegin by feeding the puppy every meal in their crate. One of the most important steps of crate-training is allowing your puppy time in the crate while you are around. Start with small increments. Put your puppy in the crate while you watch TV. Then let them out after five minutes, and keep making the duration a bit longer as they are successful and comfortable.\nIf you only put your puppy in the crate when you leave them, the crate will become a negative space, but if you place them in there while you are relaxing they will learn to relax too. Putting your puppy in the crate after a walk or a play session is a great time to practice relaxation because they will be tired. Give your puppy short bursts of alone time in the crate, give them aKong to lick, and let them out when they are done.\nUnfortunately, some dogs pee when they are excited, which is why they maypee when you pet them. Some dogs may also pee submissively when greeted by someone who makes them nervous. If you know your dog pees when you have visitors try to take them outside before visitors come over or have them meet the visitor outside so the accident happens there and then walk in the house together.\nI have found that my dogs typicallypee on one anotherby accident. One dog is marking an area, and the other dog is distracted by a scent and walks right under the dog who is peeing. Your dog may also pee on another dog when they feel like the other dog is invading their territory. This behavior should be addressed with a dog trainer as soon as possible, as it may lead to other issues.\nReferences\nHart, Benjamin L. “Environmental and Hormonal Influences on Urine Marking Behavior in the Adult Male Dog.”Behavioral Biology, vol. 11, no. 2, June 1974, pp. 167–176,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0091-6773(74)90321-6.

He was so sweet and was such a great size. I can’t stop thinking about him.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nUgh, but what about Daisy? She was here first. If I were ever going to bring another dog home, Daisy’s happiness would have to come first. Will Daisy would ever accept another dog in the house?\nWhenever I bring other dogs around Daisy, she always shoves them out of the way. She is known as the pushy dog at daycare and sometimes gets kicked out of her play group for her rude behavior. How in the world could I bring another dog home? I just know it would be a tricky situation.\nThis kind of thinking from a dog parent is normal. We know our dogs very well, and we know when to be concerned that they might get upset around a new pup. While “jealousy” isn’t exactly the word for it, it is the easiest one to use when naming this behavior. Here’s what else you need to know.\nCan dogs get jealous?\nAt times, dogs seem to be displaying feelings similar to human feelings. Some examples would be spite or jealousy. Not all feelings dogs may display are the same as human emotions, but they do display behaviors that may seem similar. Jealousy is not typically a term coined in the dog world. Dogsdo not feel jealouslike you or I would.\nTaking your time and patience when introducing new dogs will help the transition go smoothly and help keep all animals and humans involved comfortable. Just keep in mind that not all dogs need to have dog friends. Some dogs will always be better off on their own and prefer independence, and that’s OK. Respecting your dog’s boundaries is the most important part of this puzzle.\nTurns out, theycanexperience pretty complex emotions.\nHow to introduce a new dog to current dog\nIntroducing dogsis not something that should be taken lightly. Yes, there are certain dogs who are able to meet many different dogs of varying personalities and have a grand old time. But more or less, there may be tension during a first greeting. If you put planning and thought into dog introductions from the start, you can help the dogs who are meeting have the confidence they need for any new interaction.\nThe location of your meeting is a key to your success. Meeting in the jealous dog’s territory would be a poor place to go; that dog may feel as though their area is being infiltrated. Instead, take them to a neutral place neither dog has been before, like somewhere there is open ground where the dogs can have space. Try to avoid areas that are cramped and where the dogs may feel like they do not have anywhere to escape.\nBefore you let the dogs come close to meeting each other you want to set up a calm environment. Dogs meeting on a tight leash when amped up is a recipe for disaster.  Remember: Taking it slow is extremely important for success, so patience is key. Head to the park, and allow one dog to get out of the car and take a short stroll where they can sniff and pee. This will get their scent in the area. Then have that dog return to the car. Next, have the jealous dog who was waiting get out and sniff the area.\nThis way, they are getting an idea of the scent of the new dog before an interaction. After that, you can both get out of the car and begin to walk. Don’t allow the dogs to meet each other on leash yet. Continue walking. You may need to keep up the pace to prevent the dogs from pulling towards each other. Keep marching ahead. You can allow the dogs to be parallel with enough distance between them so that they can’t meet in the middle. You can then walk back the same way you just went, but switch sides so the opposite dog can smell the other dog’s scent. You want to be sure to give the dogs a lot of room when switching sides or passing.\nAs the dogs become more loose and less interested in each other, you can begin to move closer. Having your dogs on a leash but keeping it loose isveryimportant. Using a longer leash can be helpful in this situation. The leash will allow everyone to stay safe if there are any incidents. When dogs greet each other appropriately, they show loose body language.\nDogs typically come in and move to sniff each other’s behind. If you notice your dog’s ears go back or their body get stiff or stand still it is best to diffuse the situation and separate the dogs right away. Keep the interaction brief and then take a break. Give them a break to sniff and interact with the environment before introducing them again.\nKeeping the dogs on leash is important for this situation. The severity of the dog fight will determine how you break it up. If your dog is known for being aggressive, you should not introduce them to other dogs without the supervision of a trainer and theuse of a muzzle. If your dog has a tendency to get into fights, and you are aware of this, it’s your job as their parent to avoid this at all costs. It is your job to keep your dog safe and others around them safe.\nIf it is a small altercation, you may be able to call your dogs and separate them.\nIf something more serious happens, then you may need to use the leashes. You will want to pull up on the leash on the aggressive dog to cut off their airway. The dog will want air more than they want to bite, which will cause them to release. As soon as they are released, you should pull them away to separate them.\nIt can be a good idea for dogs toride in crateswhen in the car. Not only does this keep them safe, it will also keep them separated. If you can not put them in crates it is a good idea for someone to ride in the back with the pups. The backseat of a car is very close proximity for dogs who just met especially because the jealous dog would most likely be familiar with the car they are going home in. Having someone sitting in the middle of the two dogs on their way home can help keep them at enough distance that they feel comfortable. If you don’t think your dog will be able to handle the car ride with another dog or you would like to take it slower, have someone drive the other pup home separately.\nWhen bringing a new dog into your home, it is good for the dogs to go for a walk around for a bit before entering the space together. Do not bring a new dog into the home of a jealous dog when they are already in the house. Have both dogs walk in together. This will help the jealous dog feel less pressure that someone is coming into their space.\nThe first few weeks may be a little rocky, but here are some tips to help it run as smoothly as possible.\nIf yourdog is possessiveof balls, bones, or beds, it may be best to remove them and only allow them to have them under the supervision of pet parents. Possessions can be the main reason why dogs get into altercations. Even if your jealous dog has never had issues over items bringing a new dog into the home is stressful in itself so it may make your dog have some new feelings that weren’t always present.\nIf yourdog is possessiveof balls, bones, or beds, it may be best to remove them and only allow them to have them under the supervision of pet parents.

Aggression is not your dog trying to get dominance; thattheory has been disproven.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWhy do dogs get aggressive?\nDog aggression can stem from a variety of reasons. Some main reasons your dog may be showing aggressive behaviors are: fear; resource guarding or possessiveness; past dog attacks; protection; or pain or illness.\nLack of training:A dog who lacks proper training can be very impulsive, and this can cause your dog to act on instinct and without thinking during situations that are difficult for them, rather than looking to you for assistance. A dog who haspositive-reinforcement trainingis more likely to look to their guardians for help when a tricky situation arises. Positive reinforcement creates a bond between you and your dog that fosters trust.\nLack of training:A dog who lacks proper training can be very impulsive, and this can cause your dog to act on instinct and without thinking during situations that are difficult for them, rather than looking to you for assistance.

Positive reinforcement creates a bond between you and your dog that fosters trust.\nLack of socialization:Dogs who have not been properly socialized may have a higher chance of displaying aggression. When dogs do not spend time around other dogs, they do not learn proper body language and cues, and so they have a hard time understanding dog communication. Unsocialized dogs will not be able to interpret the different signs and signals dogs use to communicate. This may confuse the other dogs interacting with the unsocialized dog, causing disagreements, which can then lead to aggression. An unsocialized dog may also be fearful of other dogs. Fear is a large cause of aggression in dogs.\nLack of socialization:Dogs who have not been properly socialized may have a higher chance of displaying aggression.

Fear is a large cause of aggression in dogs.\nReacting to fear:Fear can be a large piece of dog aggression. Just like humans, dogs can go into fight or flight mode when scared. A dog will typically react with aggression when scared if they have no way out. If there is nowhere for them to go, their instinct is to do whatever they can to get away from what is scaring them. Dogs will typically use body language and show signs that they are uncomfortable before resorting to aggression. Fear aggression is used by dogs as a last resort to get the distance they need from whatever it is that scares them.\nReacting to fear:Fear can be a large piece of dog aggression.

Dogs will typically use body language and show signs that they are uncomfortable before resorting to aggression. Fear aggression is used by dogs as a last resort to get the distance they need from whatever it is that scares them.\nFrom my experience, a friendly dog can become aggressive after they have been attacked by another dog. This can happen when you take your dog to a dog park or just a walk in your neighborhood.Dog parks are notfor you to take your unsocialized dog to socialize. Unfortunately, that is what many people use them for. When an unsocialized dog is taken to a dog park to make friends, disaster can happen.Dog parks can be overstimulatingto even the friendliest, most social dog. When you bring a dog who does not understand social cues to the park, it can cause a lot of miscommunication between dogs. As a result, this can cause fear and aggression to happen.\nIf you have a puppy, it is important to expose your puppy to stable, social adult dogs. By doing this, you will have a great chance of helping your puppy learn how to be a stable and social puppy and adult in the future.\nPuppies are very impressionable, and there are fear periods during puppyhood. Puppies can be overzealous, and not all adult dogs enjoy puppy energy. Stable social adult dogs can teach your puppy the ropes through appropriate behaviors and corrections. When you introduce your puppy to a dog whose temperament you do not know, you risk the chance of letting them interact with a dog who does not have appropriate manners.\nThis could lead to a dog fight, because your young puppy does not have an understanding of dog body language. Puppies are very impressionable. A dog fight may lead your puppy to become fearful of dogs. If your puppy or dog is attacked by another dog, it is a good idea to get them around other well-mannered dogs shortly after the incident.\nWhen your dog growls, they’re expressing their emotions. A study found that you’ll likely be able to understand what they’re feeling.\nTypes of aggression in dogs\nDog aggression can show up in many areas of daily life, but it can be preventable if you know the sights and sounds to look for. Dog aggression does not normally come out of nowhere. Usually, there are telltale warning signs that help you know it is coming.\nUnderstanding dog body language and knowing what to look for is the best way to have a better idea of what your dog is thinking. Some signs that aggression is looming include:ears pinned back; stiff body; harsh stare; growling; teeth baring; lip licking; snapping; or a tucked tail. Typically dogs follow a “dog-aggression ladder.” As they work their way up the ladder, they get closer and closer to possible aggression.\nResource guarding is a normal dog behavior. Dogs may guard the bed, food, toys or people. Resource guarding may look like one dog growling at another dog while they walk by as they are eating. When they do that, your dog is telling the other dog to stay back. Resource guarding becomes a problem when your dog does not listen to cues.\nWhen a dog is pushed to the limit and feels like the resource is going to be taken away from them, they may react with aggression. You can help your dog work through these emotions with specific training. You will first want to start with management techniques to prevent the behavior from happening while you contact your vet and a trainer. These management techniques may include: keeping dogs separate; baby gates; or muzzles. Positive reinforcement, as well as counter-conditioning and desensitization (see below for more information), can help a dog get more comfortable being around resources.\nFear aggression happens when a dog is at their wit’s end and may feel like there is nowhere for them to go to get away from what is scaring them. When this happens, they will resort to aggressive behaviors to get away.\nDogs are descendants of wolves, and even though they have been domesticated for many years, they still possess an innate interest in hunting. Typically, squirrels, rabbits, birds, or rodents will fall prey to this, but small dogs can also be at risk.\nIf you notice your dog stalking, intensely staring, pouncing, or chasing, it is time to intervene. Once they have gotten ahold of the animal, it may die. You can help prevent this from happening by fulfilling your dog’s predatory behaviors in appropriate ways. Usinga flirt poleis a great way to help your dog act out their predatory energy in a safe, constructive way.\nMarking territory is a way for dogs to communicate. When dogsmark something with their urine, they can communicate their gender, age, and health, and show that they have been there or that the space is theirs. You may notice your dog marking more if you bring home a new pet. Keep an eye on this behavior and observe if you notice any other signs that your dog is uncomfortable. These could be the beginning stages of aggression.\nUsing punishment to train your dog can cause your dog to become aggressive. When using punishment, you are training your dog to do a behavior (and if they don’t, the message is that something bad will happen). Depending on your dog’s temperament, they may become aggressive after a punishment has been used on them. When you use punishment, you may cause your dog to become fearful or develop anxiety, which can make them more aggressive. By using positive reinforcement and rewarding your dog for good behavior, you can avoid causing them anxiety or stress.\nWhen a dog is hurt, they may not act like themselves. I have seen this first-hand. My lovable dog Boss, who is a loyal, calm and collected cuddle bug, got injured and seemed to become a different dog. When running down the stairs after a squirrel, his toenail got caught and was ripped halfway off. He returned to the kitchen, and I noticed a large amount of blood. When we figured out what was wrong, we went to try to stop the bleeding and bandage him up before taking him to the vet.\nWhen we went to do this, he turned and snapped at my husband because of the amount of pain he was in and the fear he had that we might try to touch his paw. Luckily,he is muzzle-trained, and so we were able to muzzle him to get him bandaged up and safely to the vet.\nMuzzle-training your dog is a great way to prepare for the unknown and to make sure everyone is safe if there ever is an injury. You can always put a muzzle on a dog, but if you train your dog to wear it before the emergency, this is one less thing that will be stressing them out during an already stressful situation.\nHow to train an aggressive dog\nIt is important to seek the help of a veterinarian when you notice your dog’s aggressive behavior. Your vet may be able to point out a medical reason why your dog is acting aggressively. The vet can prescribe medication to help ease your dog’s anxiety or pain that may be causing the aggression. Your vet may also have recommendations for dog trainers that specialize in aggression.\nFind a trainer who specializes in aggression. Not every dog trainer works with aggressive dogs. It is important to work with a dog trainer who is familiar with aggressive dogs; their practices will keep everyone safe.\nTry to take notes when you notice your dog becoming aggressive. Be observant and think ABCs: antecedent (what happens first), behavior, and consequence (what happened next).\nThis information will help you, your vet, and your trainer gain a better understanding of why your dog is acting aggressively. Once you have a better understanding of the reason behind it, you will be able to figure out the best ways to help your dog.\nExercise and stimulation can help properly provide your dog with outlets to help curb their energy and give them appropriate ways to engage in natural dog behaviors. Allow yourdog to dig in the sandboxor dirt. Usea flirt poleto safely engage their prey drive. Hide toys or treats for them to find around the house sothey can scavenge. Give them bones or frozen chews to practice pulling apart and gnawing.\nAn important part of the dog aggression puzzle is what causes your dog to act out in aggressive behaviors. To help your dog overcome these behaviors, you have to know why they are happening. Keeping a log book of when the behaviors happen, as well as what happened before and after, will help you and your team figure out the best treatment plan for them.\nDesensitization means making your dog less sensitive to the trigger. With the help of a trainer, you can work on exposing your dog slowly in small increments to help your dog become more comfortable with the trigger.\nCounter-conditioning pairs with desensitization to help your dog become more comfortable around their triggers and feeling confident. Counter-conditioning pairs what your dog likes or enjoys with something they are not thrilled with. The slow exposure helps them pair something they love with something they don’t enjoy, which allows them to change their response over time growing more comfortable and confident around something that triggers them.\nFrom my experience, a combination of desensitization, counter-conditioning, and positive reinforcement can help dogs in many ways.\nWhen you have a fearful or aggressive dog, using punishment continues tomake things worse, the dog learns they should be scared of their parents. Dogs do not understand us when we speak; they instead heavily rely on body language. So, when we use punishment to try to teach them something, all we are teaching them is that a normal dog behavior caused their owner to hurt them or yell, and they do not know any better. All they are learning is that their owner is impulsive and scary. Most of the time, the dog will not understand that they are being punished for what they just did. Especially if your timing is off even by a few seconds.\nPositive reinforcement allows you to teach your dog the right thing from the start. This helps build the dog’s confidence and foster a good relationship with them. You’ll create a dog who willingly wants to do things with and for you, such as responding to their name, standing for brushing, listening to the command “leave it,” and more.\nWhile you are working with the assistance of a trainer and your vet, it is important to manage your dog’s aggression. But that can be a slow process. During that time, you want to prevent your dog from engaging in this behavior as much as possible. The more they realize reacting with aggression gets them what they want, the more the behavior becomes engrained and more difficult to work out. Managing aggression is the best way to keep everyone safe.\nUse indoor gates:Using gates to separate dogs who don’t get along, a dog from a new baby, or dogs during feeding time will keep everyone safe. Indoor gates can be used to give everyone the space they need to feel secure. Gates can also be used during training to give you a safety net in case of an accidental training fail.\nUse indoor gates:Using gates to separate dogs who don’t get along, a dog from a new baby, or dogs during feeding time will keep everyone safe.

Gates can also be used during training to give you a safety net in case of an accidental training fail.\nKeep your dog leashed:Leash lawsshould always be followed. Allowing dogs off-leash in areas with leash laws is a recipe for disaster. People with possibly aggressive or unfriendly dogs still have a right to go to areas with leash laws. If your friendly dog does not respond to your call and runs up to the leashed dog, that could be a disaster.Unfortunately, this is a great way to also turn friendly dogs into cautious or unfriendly dogs. Over the years, this has happened to my leashed dogs a number of times. Random dogs with no manners run up to my pups, with their owners either nowhere to be found or yelling, “Don’t worry, they are friendly!” I have noticed over the years that my dogs have become less and less tolerant of this. Leashes are a great way to keep your dog safe not only while out and about, but also in your house or in your yard to help give you distance while working on training.\nKeep your dog leashed:Leash lawsshould always be followed.

Try to find empty spaces where you can take your dog where they won’t see their trigger. This will help them get exercise and stimulation safely.\nFind empty outdoor space:Your dog with difficulties still deserves to have a fulfilling life.

This will help them get exercise and stimulation safely.\nMuzzles:Muzzles are a great way to safely allow your dog to have a bit more freedom while making sure everyone is safe. Muzzles may look a little scary, but they are a great tool with many uses. Muzzles can keep your dog from eating things they shouldn’t, keeping others safe if they are in pain or injured, and, most of all, keeping your dog from biting.This is a great thing to train when you first get your new puppy. Start by getting them comfortable with the muzzle, rewarding them for looking at it, and touching it with their nose or paw. Once they are willingly doing that, you can begin to introduce them to sticking their nose in the muzzle. Put some peanut butter on the muzzle and allow them lick it off, starting on the opening of the muzzle and working your way further in. Now that they are OK with sticking their nose in, have them stick their nose further inside and reward them with a treat through the holes of the muzzle.Continue to do this, each time waiting a few seconds before rewarding them and increasing the amount of time they wait before getting a treat. Then, you will need to work on your dog putting their nose inside the muzzle and having it buckled over their head. You may need to work on getting them used to the buckle sound on its own, depending on how sensitive your dog is. Once your dog is comfortable wearing the muzzle, do things they enjoy while they are wearing it. Starting with small increments, have them wear it for a few minutes while on a walk, and continue to work your way up to the entire duration.\nMuzzles:Muzzles are a great way to safely allow your dog to have a bit more freedom while making sure everyone is safe.

Other dogs, loud bangs, someone yelling or raising their arms or fists, or coming near them when they are eating are some of the reasons a dog may feel the need to become aggressive.\nAggression is a serious behavior in dogs that can cause harm or, at worse, death. It is best to seek the assistance of a veterinarian and dog trainer. Once your dog’s aggression is under control, you can begin to work on maintaining behaviors at home under the supervision of a trainer.\nSome causes of aggressive behavior in dogs include resource guarding, pain or illness, and fear — to name a few.\nGrowling is your dog’s way of telling you they do not like what is happening, and they want space. Growling is on the ladder of aggression and is a few steps away from biting. If your dog growls, it is best to understand why they are growling and listen to what they have to say.

  "page_content": "I’m a singleton, but nobody makes a big deal out of it because most humans are born one at a time. My husband is an identical twin whose twin brother calls him his first “wombmate,” and his peculiarity is a source of endless fascination to many people. In dogs, it’s the reverse — most dogs are born with one or more littermate. A rare few, the singletons, are born on their own, as the only puppy.\nThe challenges faced by singletons summed up with the term “single puppy syndrome” are related to their development. Their behavioral issues often include a lack of bite inhibition, trouble coping withfrustration, sensitivity to touch, and difficulties in social situations.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nMy personal experience with singleton puppies\nA while ago, I met a two-year-old singleton Irish Water Spaniel. He was full of himself, had no frustration tolerance and almost no impulse control. He objected to being touched, whichcaused him to bite, andhis bite inhibitionwas not great. His issues with frustration and control led toleash aggressionwith other dogs. His pet parent worked hard (so hard!) to change his behavior, but it was a huge project.\nThe next litter from the same mother was also a solo puppy whose behavior was completely typical, though she was a bit large for the breed — not unusual for singleton puppies. The pet parent did everything right with her second singleton puppy (I’m so proud of her!): She raised her with a Lab litter that was only a few days different in age than her solo puppy, and did everything else I advised. Until her singleton was with the Lab litter, she handled the puppy a lot and pushed him off the mother while feeding, so he had to work to reattach as typical puppies do. She arranged for her puppy to spend time with socially savvy and boundary-setting adult dogs, and focused on socializing the puppy very thoroughly. She did end upspaying the breeding femaleafter the second singleton as there was too high a risk of it happening again.\nThis second singleton puppy, benefiting from all her parent did to help her, was not behaviorally challenged like so many singletons puppies are. The younger singleton turned out completely normal from a behavioral perspective, despite an unusual beginning, and this is an amazing accomplishment.\nOfcourse, you’re their parent, too. But they need their biological mom for as long as possible.\nWhat are singleton puppies?\nIf you’ve ever met a dog named Solo, Uno, or Only, it may be more than just a cute name. The first question I consider asking is whether the dog was the only puppy in their litter. It’s rare, but dogs can give birth to just one pup, and being a singleton puppy can cause issues for the dog (and their human parents) down the road.\nWhat’s the deal with one-puppy litters?\nFor dogs, like many other species, early experiences are critical for normal social development. The time fortrue socialization— during which puppies will learn lessons that directly affect lifelong behavior — lasts from weeks three to 14. That’s why puppies have the best chance for normal social development if they are allowed to be with their littermates for seven to eight weeks at least, and maybe through week 10 or 12; it’s not good for puppies to be separated from their littermates before that.\nThe record for largest litter is 24 puppies (am I normal for feeling pain just thinking about that?), according toGuinness World Records. Having up to 12 puppies is not unusual, but the average litter size is five to six puppies. Although it’s far more common for dogs to give birth to a group of pups, having just one puppy is possible, and it does happen. A dog can have a one-puppy litter but have more puppies in her next litter.\nSingle puppy litters are rare, though there’s no agreement about exactly how often it happens. People share information about big litters more often, presumably because they are proud of it and don’t often report smaller litters.\nAnd not all puppies who are the only puppy in a litter face the associated behavioral challenges known as single puppy syndrome, especially because many people take steps to prevent it. So, single puppy syndrome is quite rare, affecting less than one percent of puppies.\nThere is no one reason that a dog gives birth to just a single puppy. Sometimes, only one puppy starts developing, perhaps because of poor nutrition or due to a mistimed mating in which there is almost no overlap in the time both eggs and sperm are present. Older mothers are more likely to produce singleton puppies, and that may be true for very young mothers, too. Sometimes, there is a single pup because their would-be littermates don’t survive either in utero or the early days after birth. Small dogs have smaller litters, so they are more likely to give birth to a singleton puppy.\nChallenges unique to singleton puppies\nSingletons grow up in a completely different environment than puppies with littermates, and it affects how they develop in many ways. The littermate experience (being pushed off the nipple during feedings, crowded conditions, working to get food, constant physical contact, being walked over) prepares puppies emotionally and behaviorally to face life as a well-adjusted, emotionally stable adult, but singletons don’t get that preparation.All socializationis about preparation for later in life, so we need to work extra hard to prepare singletons for their life. Their early weeks with just mom don’t naturally provide it.\nLots of social lessons are learned during play, and those lessons often include boundaries such as not biting too hard, not walking over someone, and leaving another dog alone if they don’t want to play or interact. It’s important for singleton puppies to have lots of interaction early on with other puppies and with boundary-setting adult dogs beyond just mom.\nIt’s common for singleton puppies to be unable to tolerate crowding in space, physical contact such as normal touch and handling, and frustration. Many singleton puppies grow up to be dogs with poor bite inhibition, a tendency to be pushy, and less-than-stellar impulse control.\nBeing overweight and not developing properly with regards to locomotion and movement is sometimes an issue with singletons. It helps to monitortheir food intakeso they don’t overeat. Let them eat whenever they want, but don’t let them stay on the nipple, draining it dry at every feeding. Don’t let themilk bar be open24/7. Regularly consult with your vet about the puppy’s weight and adjust the feeding interruptions accordingly and with medical advice.\nRaising a singleton puppy\nIf you find out that your dog is a singleton puppy early — any time before the puppy heads to your home — there are things that can be done. Work onteaching bite inhibition, and handle the puppy a lot to avoid issues with touch sensitivity. Any gentle, regular handling is likely to help, and who doesn’t love the assignment to touch and hold your puppy a lot? Interrupt their feeding by pushing them gently off the mother so they must reattach to the nipple. This helps them get them used to life’s little frustrations. Have the puppy spend time with other puppies of the same age as much and as early as possible.\nIf at all feasible, raise the singleton puppy with another litter. Spending a lot of time with another litter lets a singleton have a more typical or normal experience as a young puppy. The adorable play between puppies, which is so charming to watch, is anything but light-hearted frivolous behavior — it provides puppies the foundation for normal, healthy social behavior as adults in many contexts and is a critical part of a puppy’s development and education.\nThe survival rate of singleton puppies is not as high as for puppies born with littermates. One issue before birth is that a single puppy often doesn’t produce enough hormones to induce labor in the mother, so the pregnancy extends too long.\nThat can lead to a loss of oxygen and nutrients to the puppy, or it can lead to a puppy growing too big for a safe birth. Many veterinarians perform caesarian sections on dogs who are pregnant with a single puppy. Research about health problems after birth in puppies without littermates is sparse, and there is not enough to say definitively whether there are patterns of health issues in singletons.\nWhat should you consider when training a singleton puppy?\nTraining a singleton puppy may requireextra patience; these puppies are prone to becoming frustrated easily. With that in mind, keep sessions extra short and always start and end each session with an easy skill so the puppy is successful. Practice skills requiring impulse control, such as “wait” and “stay,” to help your singleton puppy strengthen their self-control.\nReinforce them for taking treats gently, and keep your hand open and flat with a treat in your palm when giving treats to help them learn to take treats nicely. Give them further practice using their mouth appropriately byplaying fetchandtugand asking them to drop the toy as part of the game. Training a singleton puppy is much like training any other puppy, but they are more likely to need extra practice with some skills.\nIt’s likeWhat to Expect When You’re Expecting, except add“four little paws to run around your house”to the title.\nEarly interventions for singleton puppies\nThe big differences between the environment of a singleton and of a litter with multiple puppies occur in the first few months of their life. That’s when it’s most important to be proactive about interventions for the singleton. They need lots of physical contact with people and other puppies if possible. Even giving them plenty of knotted towels or stuffed animals to touch and bump into helps them get used to feeling crowded. They should be pushed away when feeding so they get used to being frustrated and to problem-solving when they must find the nipple again and reattach to it.\nAll puppies benefit from early socialization, but in the case of singletons, the risks of not having sufficient socialization are even higher. Solo puppies should be exposed to other puppies as well as to gentle people who pick them up, touch them, and handle them a lot. They need lots of early experiences with other young puppies as well as dogs of all ages.\nSingleton puppies typically have far fewer interaction with other dogs in their early weeks than puppies with litters. To counteract that and provide them with these crucial early experiences, make sure singletons have lots of interactions with other dogs, both puppies and adults. It’s also critical to get them used to being picked up, handled, and touched in a variety of (gentle) ways by people, so they can tolerate physical contact later in life.\nOne of the best ways to provide singletons with the necessary experiences for normal behavior development is with surrogate littermates. Raising a singleton with another litter or adopting similar-age puppies to be raised with the singleton by the mom can prevent many issues singletons usually face. They may not have been with littermates in utero, but it’s best for them to be raised alongside other puppies as soon as possible after birth.\nFinal thoughts: How to ensure your singleton puppy becomes a well-adjusted adult\nRemember from day one that a singleton puppy is in an unusual environment for their species. It’s up to you to help them gain the skills and experience most puppies get from being with their litter for a couple of months. It’s important to start right away making adjustments to the singleton’s care and daily life.\nSo, if you find yourself with a singleton pup, work on teaching bite inhibition early on, handle the puppy often to discourage touch sensitivity, and help the puppy experience interruptions and frustration. Most importantly, encourage the puppy to spend time with other puppies of the same age as much and as early as possible in those first 12 weeks.\nFAQs\nIt is unusual for a dog to have one puppy. Considering the challenges faced by singleton pups, it is fair to assume that having a litter of only a single puppy is not normal.\nSometimes singleton puppies are bigger, probably because they get all the nutrition meant to be shared with other puppies. However, if health or nutrition deficiencies led to one puppy, they may not be bigger.\nAdopting a singleton puppy is a challenge. It should only be considered by someone who is well aware of the potential difficulties and accepts that the puppy is less likely to develop into a dog with normal behavior than dogs who had littermates.\nWithout any intervention, singleton puppies do face a greater risk of being aggressive, which is why being proactive to help a singleton puppy develop normally is so critical. The reason solo pups may be aggressive is that their behavioral challenges are the sort of issues that lead to aggression issues. That is, they are sensitive to handling (and may therefore be uncomfortable enough to bit in response to normal physical contact) and often struggle to tolerate frustration, which can also lead to aggression.\nCompounding the issue is that many singleton puppies don’t develop proper bite inhibition, meaning that if they do bite, they may cause serious injury. With intervention, solo pups can overcome these challenges, develop normally, and not be any more likely to behave aggressively than those dogs who grew up with a litter of their own.\nReferences\nBojja, Chandana, Chandra Prasad Borra, and Srinivas Manda. “Single puppy syndrome and its management in two cases.”(2024).\nBojja, Chandana, Chandra Prasad Borra, and Srinivas Manda. “Single puppy syndrome and its management in two cases.”(2024).\nPeetala, Vijay, et al. “Clinical efficacy of mifepristone and misoprostol in induction of parturition in female dogs with single pup syndrome.”International Journal of Livestock Research9.8 (2019): 257-262.\nPeetala, Vijay, et al. “Clinical efficacy of mifepristone and misoprostol in induction of parturition in female dogs with single pup syndrome.”International Journal of Livestock Research9.8 (2019): 257-262.\nShekher, Sarswat Chandra, et al. “A rare case of single pup syndrome and its management in Labrador bitch: A case report.”Jour of Ent and Zoo Stud8.4 (2020): 1723-1724.\nShekher, Sarswat Chandra, et al. “A rare case of single pup syndrome and its management in Labrador bitch: A case report.”Jour of Ent and Zoo Stud8.4 (2020): 1723-1724.",

  "page_content": "Let’s just get this out of the way immediately and in no uncertain terms: Punishment is an outdated way of dog training. Dogs do not understand punishment, and when you use punishment as your method of training, your dog may become insecure for a period of time and then stop listening.\nOver the years, dog training has come a very long way. The majority of veterinarians and trainers are recommending the use ofpositive reinforcementto train your dog, and Kinship promotesonlythis method of training. Positive reinforcement is based on the science of how animals learn. Positive reinforcement builds your dog’s confidence and creates a dog who is willing and eager to do what is asked of them.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWhy positive reinforcement?\nUgh, what is that smell?!\n“Did you poop in the house again? Where is it? Why can’t you just poop outside like other dogs? Wedon’t poop inside!” If this is how you speak to your dog, expect them to sit there clueless as to what you are saying. They will probably just respond with a low tail wag, unsure what’s going on.\nHaving accidents in the house can happen when you have a dog, but yelling at your dog for an accident willnotstop this issue. Yelling will not stop the pooping. It will teach your dog to continue to poop in the house — but just make sure they don’t do it in front of you. This will make potty training even harder for you and for them. Your dog may even become afraid to poop in front of you on a leash due because they are afraid you will yell at them.\nInstead, do not react at all. If an accident happened, and you did not catch your pup in the act, calmly clean up the mess. If you see your dog poop, you can try your best to calmly interrupt them and take them right outside to finish their business. Be sure to reward them with a treat or praise if they use the bathroom outside.\nTurns out, even experts have a hard time defining these terms.\nEffective positive reinforcement techniques\nAgain, vets, behaviorists, trainers, and dog parents have begun to stray away from punishment as a way to train dogs. This is because of the fallout that comes with punishment methods of training. Theresearch has confirmedthat punishment is known to cause behavioral and health issues for your dog.\nInstead, dog parents and those in charge of their health and wellness have changed to using positive reinforcement as a means of training. Many parents and trainers who use positive reinforcement feel that their dogs are more willing to follow along than those who use negative ways of training. This may be because positive reinforcement teaches your dog what to do, instead of whatnotto do. Your dog will learn the correct behavior that you are looking for rather than just being punished for what they do wrong without learning what you are looking for.\nIn the beginning stages of positive reinforcement, treats can be a large piece of the puzzle. When using treats in training you want to base the value of the treats on what you are asking your dog to do. When you are asking your dog to learn a new skill, something that is tricky for them, or practice a learned behavior in an overstimulating environment, you will want to use a high-value treat ( i.e., liver, low-sodium turkey dogs, freeze-dried raw kibble pieces). Treats allow you to reward your dog quickly and precisely to help them understand the treat came because you completed this behavior.\nAs your dog learns what to do, you can begin to fade the treats, and your dog will be happy to do the behavior for love and affection.\nWhile you begin your training using treats as a reward, you want to pair the reward with praise and affection. This will help you phase out the treats over time.  Be enthusiastic with your affection and verbal praise as you give them the treats. Thinktreat, pet, voice, treat, pet, voiceas you are rewarding your dog. This will help you pepper in all three components of a something positive for your dog when they do something great.\nToys or play are a great way to praise your dog without using treats. Ask your dog to do something like sit, when they do it, throw the ball, or toss them a toy. Ask your dog to stay, and when you release them, run their tug toy along the ground like prey and get them toengage in tug. The more fun you make training for your dog, the more your dog will want to engage with you.\nClicker trainingallows you to be very precise with your training. The click happens at the exact time your dog completes the desired behavior, but the reward comes after. You first start by pairing the clicker sound with treats. Click reward, click reward, reward right away. Repeat this step over and over. Once your dog recognizes the sound, wait for them to look away and then click. Reward them when they turn to you. Over time, you can make the click sound when your dog is doing a behavior, and they will know to come back to you for the treat.\nHow to manage triggers\nIn order to help manage a behavior, you need to understand why it is happening. Most behaviors humans dub “bad” are just your dog fulfilling a natural instinct, such as barking, digging, humping, destruction etc. Is your dog stressed, sick, not getting enough exercise,getting too much exercise, or scared? Once you have figured out the reason your dog is acting out, then you can work on managing the behavior with the hope of stopping it altogether.\nAn example would be if yourdog is digging in the bedand frequently ripping a hole in it. Giving them an appropriate outlet to dig like a sandbox may help stop this behavior in the bed.\nStructured rewards\nEvery dog is different, the reward that works for one dog may not work for another.\nSome dogs like food rewards as simple as kibble, some need something more flavorful like liver to be motivated during training. Some dogs love when you rough-house with them, but sensitive dogs would rather you give them a gentle pet on the ears. When rewarding your dog, it is important to reward them in a way thattheyenjoy.\nWhen you reward them, observe how they react. If you pet them and then quickly stop, do they come in for more? Does their body look loose, or do they back away and look tense? Keep in mind the signs of stress dogs show, and look out for them when engaging and petting your dog. This will help you understand what your dog likes and doesn’t like.\nHow to stop jumping\nJumping is a hard behavior to work through because some people love a dog who jumps and some hate it, so it is important to get everyone on board when you start your training. Adog who jumps on peoplecan be a huge hazard. If a dog jumps on the wrong person, they can injure them. If you want to allow your dog to jump, it is best to use a jumping cue. Make it something you invite your dog to do; that way, you can keep others safe from their shenanigans.\nIgnoring jumping from the start is a huge part of getting your dog to stop jumping. A puppy might be cute and fun when they jump on you. But a 10-pound dog who jumps is not the same when they are 50 pounds. If your dog jumps on you, do not yell at them to get off or push them away. This makes jumping a game. Ignore them. Just stand there or turn away, and wait until their four feet are on the ground. Only pet them then. Repeat this over and over.\nWhen a stranger asks to pet your dog, you can tell them, “No.” Because any time your dog has a chance to jump, your training goes out the window. If you decide to let them pet your dog, begin by telling them that your dog is in training and to ignore them if they jump. Then shorten the leash so your dog will not be able to get any height if they do try to jump.\nUsing strangers to help train your dog can be hugely beneficial. You just need to be willing to speak up for yourself and your dog, because each time your dog engages in a behavior that you do not want — like jumping — you are increasing the likelihood that your dog will engage in that behavior in the future.\nWhen your dog is getting pet, calmly reward them for keeping their four feet on the ground. Give them the reward when they are engaging with the person petting them and staying on the ground. Be sure not to reward them if they are paying attention to you or acting hyper. You want them to understand that the treat comes when they are calmly engaged with the person who is petting them.\nPlaying the “sit” game is a great way to train your dog not to jump when you are petting them. Ask your dog to sit, and then give them all the pets and love they could want. As soon as they step out of the sit position, stop petting them and ignore them.\nWhen they sit back down, engage in the petting and love again. Play this over and over. Dogs are smart and they will catch on that they get love when they are sitting. This is a great game to play with all of your family members within the home and any visitor you have. Over time, your dog will get it and  learn to request love and pets by sitting next to you instead of jumping.\nHow to stop barking\nBarking can be a helpful (and annoying) behavior. Barking can get your attention if there is an intruder outside; it can deter unwanted people or animals from coming close. Barking can also wake a baby, be incessant, or cause issues with your neighbors. Youcanstop your dog from barking incessantly with patience and a lot of training.\nAs always when your dog is doing a behavior that you want to stop or decrease, you need to figure out why they are doing it. Is a squirrel taunting your dog from the window? Do they want the ball that rolled under the couch? Do they hear a sound you don't hear?\nOnce you have addressed why they are barking, you can move on to working on getting it to stop. Shades can help block your doors or windows to prevent your dog from seeing the squirrels or neighbors walking by. Sound machines or the TV can help block out unwanted sounds that may make your dog bark.\nGet your dog to bark. Once your dog is barking, do something to distract them from it and get their attention by picking up a toy or making a sound. When they look away from what they are barking at, stop and reward them with a treat.\nRepeat this over and over, gradually making the period between the barking and the treat longer. Once your dog is consistently quieting, you can begin to add the word “quiet” to the chain of events. Your dog may have spent a lot of time being reinforced by barking, so it may take a while for them to understand the quiet cue.\nDesensitizing your dog to the trigger starts with small and slow exposures. This is a long process and takes many calculated exposures. If your dog barks at thunder, you can begin to play low, quiet thunder sounds while they eat dinner. Gradually make it louder as they continue to stay comfortable. If you notice them being bothered by the sound, go back to the lower volume. Do this repeatedly until you can play the thunder sounds loud enough, simulating real thunder.\nCounterconditioning is a way to help your dog learn to feel positive about something they do not enjoy. Any time your dog sees their trigger, you will reward them, no matter how your dog reacts. This repeated reward will teach your dog that when they see the scary thing, a treat comes. Over time, it will help your dog stop acting negatively toward the trigger, because they will now be conditioned to feel a different way.\nOffering fewer treats can actually be agoodthing.\nHow to stop nipping and biting\nNipping and biting is a natural behavior for your puppy. One reason it is important to keep your puppy with their siblings andmom for eight weeksor more is because during that time,puppies learn bite inhibition.\nPuppies will learn how hard they can bite and when nipping is appropriate or not. Bite inhibition is extremely important for your dog to learn. If a dogever has a reason to bitesomeone or something, they will be able to have control over how hard they bite, which will keep them from potentially breaking skin.\nYour puppy will most likely still try to bite you even if they stay with their litter for over eight weeks; biting is a form of puppy play. If your puppy bites you while you walk by, ignore them, do not run away or pull your clothes from their mouth — this makes biting a game. Instead, ignore them, and stand still. I like to bring my hand down to the area they are biting and hold the very end of my clothing next to their teeth where they are biting so they can not play tug with the clothing. This will also prevent them from ripping a hole. When they let go, wait a few seconds before engaging with them when they are acting appropriately.\nIf your puppy accidentally bites you while they are playing, be sure to stop, turn away, and ignore them for a minute before going back to play.\nIf your dog is biting inappropriately, teaching them what they can bite should help. If your puppy is in a bite-y mood, drag your their toy across the floor back and forth, making it look enticing for your puppy to chase.\nTry to have toys on hand during greetings or any other time you know your puppy may bite, and entice them to chew on the toy instead.\nLike I mentioned above, bite inhibition in a dog is very important. You can help teach your puppy how to use their mouth gently. When your puppy mouths you, gently allow them. The moment your puppy bites down and it hurts, make just the slightest yelp (like a puppy would), and then ignore them. Pause the play for a few minutes. Then go back to play. Repeat the yelp, and ignore any time they bite too hard.\nWhen you feel your puppy is playing too rough, you can help them understand this by yelping and stopping play for a few minutes. This is similar behavior to what their puppy siblings would do to communicate they do not like the level of play going on.\nHow to find a trainer\nBelow you can find a list of companies that use positive reinforcement training techniques. When you head over to their websites, you can find more information about their training approaches and decide what works for you. When training with positive reinforcement, you create a special bond with your dog and build their confidence at the same time.

  "page_content": "My dog, Covid, is very protective of me, which is good to an extent. But he won’t even allow my 16-year-old and 20-year-old kids to hug me without getting defensive toward them. I’m not sure if he is just intimidating them or if he will really attack them, but I don’t want to find out. What can I do to prevent this from happening? - Amanda\nThis is a scary problem to have, especially when kids are involved. The truth is, it’s also a hard question to give a straightforward answer to. A lot depends on your dog’s motivation. Is your dog protecting you? Is he resource guarding? Is he in fear of the kids? Observe your dog’s body language while going toward your kids — ishe barking and growling? Is hishair standing on end?\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nIn general, focus on utilizing a “stay” cue in this case, ideally through a barrier like a baby gate — but not something as obstructing as, say, a tall fence. Have the dog do a “stay” cue, then have your kids approach. Give them a hug, move away, and give Covid ahigh-value reward. Repeat this many times. What you’re trying to do is change the dog’s emotional association to people approaching and hugging you. You might want to start with actions smaller than a hug, such as a handshake, or just talking in close proximity.\nAs far as Covid’s behavior toward your children, if it seems truly scary and aggressive, you’ll need to expose him to increasingly challenging versions of the things that stress him out. It seems like this isn’t the only thing that makes Covid wig out. There’s something called a “relaxation protocol” — theKaren Overall Relaxation Protocol— that you can find online. Start with that and have some of the last things you do involve family members approaching for a hug. If there’s true danger, make sure there is space between the family and the dog while doing this.\nSometimes, people train a dog to do a “stay” cue through a barrier, and the dog still reacts when they’re right next to their mom, even if they don’t have a problem from five feet away. In this case, you would have to practice in closer and closer proximity.\nAt that point, while practicing, you might want toconsider a muzzleto make sure we’re keeping everybody safe. Keep in mind that muzzle training is its own separate task — you shouldn’t just slap a muzzle on a dog. You would need to go through muzzle desensitization.The Muzzle Projectis great if you need help doing this. Work on training — the “stay” command and counter conditioning toward family members — while doing muzzle desensitization. Then, as you’re getting closer and closer, you can combine the muzzle and the training protocol.\nIn addition to training your dog out of overprotective behaviors, it can help to understand where this behavior comes from and why your dog may feel so strongly about keeping you safe.\nLearning about dogs’ protective instinct\nMany people love dogs for their loyal behaviors, which go all the way back to their wolf ancestors. Dogs are pack animals, and they consider their human parents part of their pack and will protect you from any perceived threats. While some dogs are more protective than others, all canines have some level of protective instinct and want to keep you safe.\nJust as you consider your dog a part of your family, they consider you a part of their pack. That means your dog won’t stand for anyone who seems to threaten you. Many dogs were bred over time to guard homes and land by alerting owners to anything that seemed out of place, like a stranger or a wild animal.\nThese days, your dog likely doesn’t need to guard your home as intensely, but they will likely still bark to let you know about anything unusual. This is a natural behavior, but your dog should also stay calm and settle down once they understand there’s no real threat.\nUnfortunately, there’s a rather thin line between protection and aggression, and it can be hard to identify the difference. While your dog’s protective instincts come from a place of love, aggression is a result of fear or insecurity and can quickly turn dangerous.\nAn overprotective dog becomes aggressive even when the situation doesn’t call for it and may even try to harm a person or animal who gets near their human. It’s critical that you discourage this behavior if it happens; otherwise, your dog may end up biting or attacking someone.\nSigns that your dog is protecting you\nStudies show that dogsgenuinely care about their human parents and wish to protect them. Your dog’s instinct to keep you safe is natural and even beneficial. Pay attention to your dog’s body language to understand if they’re trying to protect you. Look for signs such as:\nBlocking you from a perceived threat with their body\nBlocking you from a perceived threat with their body\nBarking (at strangers, noises, other animals, or anything they consider out of the ordinary)\nBarking (at strangers, noises, other animals, or anything they consider out of the ordinary)\nGrowling in warning\nGrowling in warning\nStaying vigilant and watching for danger\nStaying vigilant and watching for danger\nWhat causes the overprotection behavior?\nYour dog wants to protect your pack (yes, that meansyou) because a pack is stronger together. Dogs tend to be more watchful over members of the family that they perceive as less able to care for themselves, such as babies and small children.\nHow to fix your dog’s overprotection\nIf your dog shows any overprotective behavior, such as growling or snarling at anyone who approaches you, make sure to address the behavior immediately. These actions can quickly escalate to more aggressive behavior, which can quickly turn dangerous for your family and those around you. Overprotectiveness may manifest differently in different dogs, but look out for aggressivebehavior that is unprovoked, such as showing teeth, barking, snapping, or even biting.\nThe best thing you can do to prevent overly reactive dog behavior is establish a clear daily routine. Dogs thrive on regular schedules, so make sure to stay consistent with training and slowly expose your dog to new people, animals, and situations.\nDogs pick up on their human parents’ moods, so even if your dog acts overly protective, it’s important to stay calm yourself. Even if you feel nervous, do your best not to show it and encourage your dog to approach new situations with calm curiosity.\nWhen out walking your dog or meeting new people, always keep your distance at first. If your dog has a history of aggressive or overprotective behavior, make sure to stay well away from other people and animals to avoid an incident.\nAlways use a leash when introducing your dog to someone new. A leash provides you with control and allows you to pull the dog away if things become testy.\nMost aggressive or overprotective behavior can be prevented with proper socialization and training. Your dog should be socialized with a variety of people, animals, and situations early in their life to help avoid later behavioral issues. And even if you adopt an adult dog, you can still work on socialization and training to help them feel more secure and less likely to lash out.\nA vet’s response to a common overprotective dog question\nKinshipCollective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a stubborn pup to listen up.\nWhile working with a dog behaviorist is key to reducing overprotective behaviors, it’s also important to consult your veterinarian to determine what’s causing these reactions — and what you can do to reduce and prevent the behavior.\nDr. Leslie Sinn, a veterinary behaviorist in Ashburn, Virginia, notes that overprotective behavior in dogs may stem from fear or resource guarding. “If a dog is showing signs of overt/forward aggression, it is serious. For example, stiffing, staring, moving between the owner and the approaching person or dog, growling, barking, and/org lunging are all signs that the dog is struggling.”\nAs with any unwanted behavior,neverpunish your dog for being overly protective. Work on training to ensure that your dog listens to commands like sit and stay. Once your dog has calmed down, reward them with a high-value treat. If your dog continues to act aggressively, keep them away from other people and animals until you have control.\n“Ask for an alternative behavior, such as sit or move behind me, and reward [the dog for their good behavior,” Dr. Sinn says. She also emphasizes the importance of reading your dog’s body language and warning others if your dog is worried or anxious. “Remove the dog from the situation or prevent the situation from occurring in the first place, meaning, if your dog is not social, then don’t take him to the brewery with you!”\nWith patience and consistency, as well as the efforts of a vet and behaviorist, you can work on reducing your dog’s overprotective behaviors and helping them feel more secure with new situations and people.\n“Aggression in Dogs - Territorial.”VCA_corporate, 2012,vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/aggression-in-dogs-territorial.\n“Aggression in Dogs - Territorial.”VCA_corporate, 2012,vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/aggression-in-dogs-territorial.\nHow to Stop Territorial Barking | Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. 15 Apr. 2020,vet.tufts.edu/news-events/news/how-stop-territorial-barking.\nHow to Stop Territorial Barking | Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. 15 Apr. 2020,vet.tufts.edu/news-events/news/how-stop-territorial-barking.\nYes, Your Dog Wants to Rescue You | ASU News.28 May 2020,news.asu.edu/20200528-discoveries-yes-your-dog-wants-rescue-you.\nYes, Your Dog Wants to Rescue You | ASU News.28 May 2020,news.asu.edu/20200528-discoveries-yes-your-dog-wants-rescue-you.",

  "page_content": "Bringing a new puppy into a home is a big undertaking when it comes to training. But if you have another dog that adds another layer to welcoming a puppy into your home. It can be intimidating to introduce a puppy to a dominant dog, so you want to make sure you do it in the right way that’s good for both dogs.\nNote that in modern training, behaviorists havedisproved the dog dominance theory; they don’t operate by hierarchal pack rules. In other words, they don’t operate by rules that one dog is superior to another, and they don’t think of themselves as superior to their humans, either. So, for the purpose of this article, we refer to the dominant dog as the pup who is older, trained, and may have established relationships with the humans in the environment.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWhat’s the best way to introduce a puppy to a dominant dog?\nYou want to be able to prepare first to introduce a puppy into your home. To help the more dominant dog, you want to put anything that they might guard into one spot to avoid any conflict with a new puppy. Vice versa goes for the new puppy, you want to make sure all their things are in their own area. According to dog trainer and owner ofAnother Chance Training, Shir Limazati, having the right location for the introduction is key.\n“Introducing a puppy to a dominant dog needs to be done with caution and in neutral territory. Meaning, the introduction is best done not on the dominant dog’s turf,” she says.\nWhy is it important to introduce your new puppy to your dominant dog properly?\nHaving a proper introduction is important in order to avoid aggression or territorial issues between the dogs, which could cause stress between them. A gradual introduction helps them to build a positive relationship.\nBalancing puppy socialization and safety is tricky.\nWill a dominant dog accept a new puppy as a member of the pack?\nAgain, it all depends on the introduction. A dominant dog will accept a new puppy into the pack if the introduction is done properly by giving them time and space to get to know each other and following specific guidelines.\nStep-by-step guide to introduce your puppy to your dominant dog\nThere are helpful steps to go through to make sure that introducing your puppy to your other dog goes smoothly.\nPreparing for the introduction is key. You first want to make sure the dogs come to a neutral spot to meet for the first time. Bringing a friend or family member so there’s attention for both dogs is important as well.\nTry bringing the dogs together and let them greet each other naturally. Limazati mentionspaying attention to the leashis important. “Leave the leashes on the dog and the puppy and you can drop the leash so they can meet each other with no tension on the leash in the enclosed outdoor space.”\nLet the dogs do their own thing but be sure to monitor their behavior for signs that they aren’t getting along so you can separate them immediately. Be sure to reinforce positive behavior when they are getting along.\nMaintaining a new routine in order to make sure their continued introductions go smoothly is imperative. And keep those in neutral spaces until it’s clear that the dogs are getting along.\nKeep making short introductions and constantly monitor their interactions together until the dogs feel comfortable with each other.\nStrategies for a successful introduction to your dominant dog\nThere are many strategies to use when introducing your dominant dog to a new puppy in the household.\nHaving the dogs meet in an area that is not special to either of them is important so neither feels territorial about their surroundings. In other words, don’t introduce your new puppy to your existing dog in your backyard, which your dog probably considers theirs.\nHaving both dogs walk alongside one another at a comfortable distance is a good way for the dogs to get to know another in a neutral way. “I always recommend first going for a walk with the dog and the puppy in a place that’s new to the dominant dog.  If the walk goes well, you can then go to an enclosed outdoor space that is again neutral to the dominant dog — a backyard that is fenced that is not a place the dominant dog usually plays,” Limazati says.\nMaking sure the setting where the dogs are meeting is very important. Again, that’s why having neutral territory is important. Limazati also notes that you want to make sure there’s nothing either will feel any ownership over.\n“You want to make sure there are no high value items left out — no bones, special toys, and absolutely no food bowls.  Water is usually OK.” You’ll also want to be sure to monitor the behavior of both dogs and read their body language to make sure they are getting along, or take them apart if they aren’t.\nYou want to gradually increase how much time the dogs spend together as they get more comfortable with one another until they are able to be together on their own.\nBe sure to consistentlyheap praise and treatson both dogs as their interactions continue to go well. Do this to also help encourage calm behavior and appropriate play.\nKeeping a routine that fulfills both dogs’ needs is important. Be sure to keep specific times for mealtime but feed both dogs in separate areas. Have a regular walk and play schedule, making sure both dogs get enough attention.\nIf any behavior in either dog changes, individually or together, be sure to immediately intervene so things don’t escalate.\nSigns the introduction is going well\nPay attention to the signs that the introduction between the dogs is going well. Lizamati offers tips for what to look out for. “You want to look for play bows, the puppy rolling onto his back, happy wagging tails, mouths open, and a give and take play style. As long as you do not see aggressive behavior from the dominant dog, I would recommend outside visits several times before meeting indoors,” she says.\nHow to handle aggressive behavior\nAccording to Lizamati, there are many signs to look for when it comes to aggressive behavior. “Aggressive behavior or signs it’s not going well is — either dog showing teeth, hackles raised (the ‘mohawk’ on their back), the puppy showing signs of stress — going between your legs, tail tucked, biting on the neck area, aggressive barking, etc.,” she says.\nIf there are signs of aggression, you immediately want to separate them. “If any signs of aggression come up, this is when you take the leash and separate the dogs. I always bring safety tools with me for a meet up — a bottle of water is the quickest way to separate dogs when it’s getting too intense. If you see a fight arise, pour the water over the dog that is the aggressor to shock them into a pause and then separate them immediately,” Lizamati says.\nUse these tips before making the big decision.\nHow to know when it’s time to reach out to a dog behavior specialist\nLizamati suggests that once you see signs of aggression or dominance issues that is when one should contact a professional.\nFinal thoughts: Introducing your puppy to your dominant dog\nIt’s a process introducing your puppy to your dominant dog, one that needs a lot of patience and care. Be sure to continue to read the body language of your dogs and take things very slow in a neutral area for both dogs.\nFAQs\nIf your current dog has previously shown hostility to other dogs, you might want to think twice about adopting a new dog. However, if your dog has other dog friends, getting another dog might work as long as you are sure to do proper training.\nIt can take about two to four weeks to see signs of friendship between newly introduced dogs.\nNo, that’s something you don’t want to do right after introducing your puppy to your older dog. Even if they seem friendly, you want to wait several weeks before you let them be alone together.\nYou want to start with a large distance between them and gradually close the space between them while closely monitoring all interactions. Use positive reinforcement with praise and treats to encourage calm behavior. Depending on how aggressive the dog is, having a behavioral trainer on hand may be good for reinforcement.",

  "page_content": "One minute, you’re happily petting your dog, enjoying a bonding moment, when suddenly — seemingly out of nowhere — your dog growls. The growl isn’t ferocious. It’s more like a low rumble. But it makes you pause mid-pet, wondering if you’ve crossed an unseen line.\nWhat does it mean when a dog growls at you while you’re showing affection? Is it a warning growl? Or is your dog just being more vocal than usual?\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nDogs communicate with us in various ways: through expressions, their tails, and even growls. However, before you assume the worst, it’s essential to understand why the growl is not always asign of aggression, displeasure, or hostility.\nRead on for expert answers to this perplexing but common dog behavior.\nMain takeaways\nGrowling while being pet is a common form of communication, and isn’t always negative.\nGrowling while being pet is a common form of communication, and isn’t always negative.\nKey reasons for growling include feeling threatened, being in pain, overstimulation, resource guarding, fear, or even showing affection.\nKey reasons for growling include feeling threatened, being in pain, overstimulation, resource guarding, fear, or even showing affection.\nUnderstanding your dog’s body language, such as relaxed versus tense postures, helps you interpret whether the growl signals happiness or distress.\nUnderstanding your dog’s body language, such as relaxed versus tense postures, helps you interpret whether the growl signals happiness or distress.\nTo address growling, stay calm, respect your dog’s boundaries, and use positive reinforcement to encourage relaxed behavior.\nTo address growling, stay calm, respect your dog’s boundaries, and use positive reinforcement to encourage relaxed behavior.\nConsult a professional trainer or vet if the growling persists, becomes aggressive, or is linked to potential health issues.\nConsult a professional trainer or vet if the growling persists, becomes aggressive, or is linked to potential health issues.\nIs it normal for dogs to growl while being pet?\nThis may be surprising, but it’s normal for some dogs to growl while being pet. However, the meaning behind the growl depends on the situation. Dogs don’t have the verbal language to tell us how they feel, so relying on growling, barking, and tail wagging is their way to get their point across.\nAccording toDr. Alisha Kidwell, a veterinarian in North Carolina’s Cabarrus Animal Hospital, not every growl indicates negative feelings or a precursor to aggressive behavior. A playful growl can signify that your dog is enjoying your attention. It sounds like a playful yip and may be accompanied by tail-wagging and your dog nuzzling their head or body against your hand. The dog’s body language is relaxed, and they seem happy to be around you.\nOn the other hand, an aggressive growl signals discomfort, fear, or overstimulation. Dogs typically express negative emotions with stiff, tense body language, including a tucked tail, side-eye glance, and rigid stance.\nSubtle body language cues that accompany the growl can give you a better idea of what your pup is trying to communicate.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\n7 reasons why your dog is growling when you pet them\nSometimes, dogs growl because they feel uneasy and threatened, which can happen in a vulnerable situation. For instance, when a pup is sound asleep in bed, sneaking up to rub their belly may cause them to give you a warning growl. The growl allows your dog to establish boundaries, signaling they don’t want to be touched in that moment.\nDogs can’t outright tell you when they are hurt. If your dog growls when you pet a specific area, like their leg, tail, or back, it could be asign of pain. Growls can express discomfort in the same way that whining can.\nYour pup may be dealing with an injury from outside or playing with other dogs, have arthritis, or be exhibiting other health-related problems. If the growl persists or becomes more frequent, consult a veterinarian to rule out severe injuries or medical issues.\nIf you’ve been playing with your dog and doling out a lot of energetic attention, they may growl when you try to pet them during their wind-down time. Overstimulation is common, especially in high-energy breeds like Border Collies, Australian Shepherds, and Jack Russell Terriers, who love to play and get excited quickly. In this case, the growl is an “I need a break” signal.\nSomedogs are possessiveof their toys, food, and even favorite people. If you’re petting your pup while they eat dinner or play with their prized toy, they may growl as a warning to stay away. This is calledresource guardingand is natural canine behavior, but it can escalate if not addressed. Professional training can teach your dog that caring is sharing if this becomes a recurring issue.\nFear is a common trigger forgrowling in dogs. If your dog is nervous or scared, they will growl to express unease. This is especially true for adopted dogs who have had negative experiences. Fearful growls are accompanied by other signs of fear, like wide eyes, raised hackles, and a tucked tail.\nIf fear is the problem, approach your dog calmly and slowly, allowing them to get comfortable with your presence before you attempt to pet them.\nIt may seem counterintuitive, but some dogs growl to show that they love being pet. Breeds like Great Danes, Pugs, and Golden Retrievers may rumble low in their throat when they feel relaxed or happy. You can tell they are calm or content if a wagging tail, relaxed ears, and soft, affectionate eyes accompany the growl.\nHave you ever touched your dog when they have been in a deep sleep, only to be met with a jump and growl?Your pup was surprisedand didn’t expect to be touched. Another example is if they growl when you touch their ears or paws — areas that are iffy for some dogs — and they growl as a reaction to the unexpected pressure of your hand.\n“No touch-y!”\nWhat to do when your dog growls at you\nDon’t panic if your dog growls while being pet. Take a breath and assess the situation. Stay calm, and avoid aggressive reactions like raising your voice or yelling. Dogs are sensitive to emotions, and your aggressive behavior could trigger theirs if you overreact.\nIs your dog relaxed or tense? Look at their body language when they growl. This can help you understand your dog’s intent. For example, a comfortable dog may growl out of pleasure or contentment, while a tense pup may express fear or discomfort. If your dog is growling because they feel threatened or overstimulated, give them space. Respect their boundaries, and don’t force petting if they aren’t in the mood to be touched. Just like people, dogs are entitled to their feelings and boundaries.\nWhen your dog is calm and relaxed, use positive reinforcement, such as treats and praise, to encourage peaceful behavior. This helps your dog associate petting and affection with positive experiences.\nHow to train your dog to stop growling when you pet them\nTraining your dog to stop growling when you pet them takes time and patience.\nDesensitize your dog to touch: Gradually get your dog used to being pet. Start with short, intentional petting sessions for a few minutes several times daily, then progress to longer petting sessions as your dog becomes comfortable with being touched.\nDesensitize your dog to touch: Gradually get your dog used to being pet.

They can help you understand underlying causes and provide strategies to better your dog’s reaction to petting. If you think a medical concern or problem is causing your dog to growl while being pet, a veterinarian can help rule out pain or illness.\nBottom line\nWhen your dog growls while being pet, it’s not always out ofaggression or anger.

  "page_content": "Have you ever come home to a tail-wagging, ear-flopping, leaping dog who greets you with a puddle on the floor? You’re not alone.\nMany pet parents have had the “Oh no, not again” moment when their pooch loses control of their bladder before they can strap on a leash and head out the door. This quirky behavior can leave you wondering what’s going on inside your dog’s brain — whether it’s excitement from you coming home, meeting new people, or feeling overwhelmed.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWhat can you do when your dog pees when excited? While it may seem like a mystery (or minor disaster), excited urination is common in dogs, especially younger ones still learning bladder control. Your dog is likely experiencing an emotional overload, so there’s no need to panic.\nHere’s the rundown on why it happens, what you can do, and how to stop it from happening every time you get home from work (or when your dog gets a little excited).\nMain takeaways\nExcited urination is a common behavior, especially in puppies or younger dogs, caused by emotional overload or anxiety during moments of excitement.\nExcited urination is a common behavior, especially in puppies or younger dogs, caused by emotional overload or anxiety during moments of excitement.\nDogs may lose bladder control when overwhelmed by joy, anticipation, or anxiety, and it’s often an automatic response.\nDogs may lose bladder control when overwhelmed by joy, anticipation, or anxiety, and it’s often an automatic response.\nRewarding calm behavior, like sitting or not peeing when excited, can help teach your dog better bladder control during overstimulating moments.\nRewarding calm behavior, like sitting or not peeing when excited, can help teach your dog better bladder control during overstimulating moments.\nPunishing or getting angry at your dog for peeing during excitement won’t help, and may worsen the problem by increasing anxiety.\nPunishing or getting angry at your dog for peeing during excitement won’t help, and may worsen the problem by increasing anxiety.\nIf your dog’s urination seems frequent or includes signs of pain, it’s essential to visit a vet to rule out underlying medical problems like urinary tract infections.\nIf your dog’s urination seems frequent or includes signs of pain, it’s essential to visit a vet to rule out underlying medical problems like urinary tract infections.\nIs it normal for dogs to pee when excited?\nYes, it is common fordogs to pee when excited. While it may seem embarrassing or like negative behavior, peeing when excited doesn’t indicate a bad or disobedient dog. It’s a quirk of their biology and emotions.\nThis behavior is often seen inpuppies and younger dogswho haven’t mastered bladder control yet. However, even older dogs can experience excited urination in moments of intense joy or anxiety. Think of it as the canine version of a nervous laugh or accidental snort. It happens when they feel overstimulated, excited, or overwhelmed (sometimes by the sight of you coming home after a long day away).\nBefore you panic and assume your dog is destined to pee when excited, take a breath. This isn’t typically a sign of something serious. If you notice that your dog pees in certain situations, like when greeting you or playing with other dogs, it’s part of their emotional response. However, you should consult a veterinarian if the peeing seems more frequent and paired with negative body language, like whimpering or a tucked tail.\nIf your dog loses their sh*t over anything—from a squirrel to a guest. Here are some tips to curtail that.\nWhy dogs pee when excited\nDogs pee when excited because they have difficulty controlling their bodily functions when their emotions are in overdrive. According toDr. Alisha Kidwell, a licensed veterinarian at North Carolina’s Cabarrus Animal Hospital, this kind of urination is often tied to over-excitement or anxious feelings in younger or less confident dogs. They’re not purposefully trying to be disrespectful, spiteful, or disobedient. It’s an automatic response.\nEmotional overload: Dogs pee when excited due to overwhelming emotions such as anticipation, anxiety, and joy.

When your dog behaves calmly and doesn’t pee during an exciting moment, praise them and give them their favorite treats. Use positive reinforcement to encourage calm behavior. So, when they greet you without drenching the floor, reward them with a treat, a pat on the head, and a “good dog.”\nDoes your dog lose their cool when you walk through the door? Instead of greeting them excitedly when you come home, ignore them for a minute or two until they calm down. Don’t mirror their excitement. This helps them remain calm but expectant to avoid peeing from overstimulation.\nBasic commands can help your dog focus during moments of intense excitement. Train your dog to “sit” or “stay” calmly when you walk in the door, making them less likely to overreact. Obedience training can help dogs manage their energy and focus on you instead of becoming overwhelmed by the excitement of a situation.\nDogs are sponges for energy. They may get overwhelmed if you constantly run around and exciting things happen. Establish a peaceful routine tocreate a calm, predictable environmentfor your dog. Your pup will mimic your energy and react accordingly to exciting stimuli. Keeping your mood controlled and stable will help reduce urine-soaked outbursts of excitement from your dog.\nOne of the best ways to reduce excited urination is to limit the number of new things your dog is exposed to at one time. When meeting new people or animals, keep the situation low-stress and controlled. Limit the number of people they meet at once or take it slow with new experiences, especially if your dog is easily overwhelmed.\nDogs, especially puppies, need to burn energy. If they don’t get enough exercise, their pent-up excitement can result in puddled accidents. Regular walks, playtime, and mental stimulation, like games and puzzle-style toys, are essential to keep your dog calm until it’s time to release energy. A well-exercised dog is less excitable, meaning fewer pee spots on the floor.\nRevisit the basics of potty training. Does your dog have an outdoor routine? Do they have plenty of opportunities to relieve themselves throughout the day? A quick potty break before exciting moments will limit accidents, while regular trips outside ensure their bladder remains controlled and (mostly) empty. Is a new guest coming over? Take your pup out for a walk before the guest arrives so they won’t pee on the floor even if they get over-excited.\nThe next time your dog pees on your favorite rug, be prepared with this simple, three-step method.\nWhat not to do if your dog pees when excited\nPunishing your dog for excited urination is cruel. It would be like someone yelling at you when you sneezed or coughed. For many dogs, peeing when excited is a natural bodily response that they can’t control. Punishing them would only confuse and scare them. It would add to their anxiety, making the situation worse.\nYour dog may not realize they’ve had an accident, but they will likely discover the mess after the excitement has passed. Many dogs will feel shame and embarrassment after an accident. Don’t ignore that it happened. Calmly clean up the mess and use basic commands to redirect their attention to gentle, positive behavior, like sitting or lying down.\nGetting mad at your dog won’t help them stop peeing when they get excited. Dogs don’t have the bladder control we wish they did, so getting angry is stressful for them and you. Stay calm, and remember they aren’t doing this intentionally — it’s an emotional overflow.\nHow to tell if inappropriate urination is a medical problem\nIf your dog’s accidents are frequent, severe, or accompanied by signs of pain, blood, or change in color or quantity of urine, schedule a veterinarian appointment immediately. Medical issues like urinary tract infections, bladder stones, or kidney problems could lead to inappropriate urination. Trust your gut — if something doesn’t feel right, get your dog checked by a professional.\nBottom line\nExcited urination is a common (albeit inconvenient) behavior in dogs.\nExcited urination is a common (albeit inconvenient) behavior in dogs.\nIt is a natural response to emotions, especially in puppies.\nIt is a natural response to emotions, especially in puppies.\nYou can help your dog learn to control their bladder during exciting moments by practicing positive training techniques, understanding, and patience.\nYou can help your dog learn to control their bladder during exciting moments by practicing positive training techniques, understanding, and patience.\nRemember to keep calm, reward good behavior, and give your dog time to mature.\nRemember to keep calm, reward good behavior, and give your dog time to mature.\nMany puppies will eventually develop solid bladder control.\nMany puppies will eventually develop solid bladder control.\nFAQs\nYourdog may pee when you pet thembecause they feel excited, anxious, or submissive.

They investigate everything — no clue too small, no smell too funky. So, it could be simple curiosity when dogs stare at the wall. Maybe a light flickered. Or there’s a weird shadow. Or a tiny spider skittered across the wallpaper. To your dog, staring at the wall is like watching a live nature documentary unfolding before their eyes.\nDogs are clever. If they notice that staring at the wall will get your attention, they may do it to get words of concern, pets, and potential redirection of playtime or treats. If you respond to wall-staring with panic, worry, and belly rubs, your dog will use that tactic again.\nDogs hear better, smell better, and see things we may not see (which is slightly terrifying to think about). When they stare at a wall, they might pick up faint noises like mice scurrying, pipes creaking, or the hum of electrical wires. To them, the sounds are fascinating. It may remind you to check for critters in the walls.\nYour dog is quirky, but staring at a wall could indicate compulsive behavior. Think of it as a dog’s version of zoning out, except it’s not always harmless. This kind of behavior could be linked to stress, boredom, or a mental health problem. If you feel like your dog stares at the wall excessively, it may be time to consult a behaviorist or veterinarian.\nBefore you call in a ghost-hunting team, look closer at the wall where your dog is staring. Is there a bug? A smudge? A light reflection dancing around from something outside? Dogs have better eyesight for motion than detail, so what looks like an ordinary wall to you may be a mural of moving shapes to dogs.\nLike humans, dogs’ brains can experience wear and tear as they age. Canine cognitive decline (CCD) is a condition like dementia that causes behaviors such as prolonged, excessive wall-staring. According toDr. Alisha Kidwell, a licensed veterinarian from the Cabarrus Animal Hospital in North Carolina, staring at walls can indicate cognitive decline in senior dogs. Other signs include confusion, agitated pacing, or forgetting basic commands they have known and practiced for years.\nIf your dog stares blankly at the wall as if paused mid-thought, this could indicate a neurological disorder or a focal seizure. These “zoned out” moments may seem harmless but could signal an underlying health condition. Pay attention to your dog’s behavior and body language for other symptoms like twitching, loss of balance, or unresponsiveness.\nDogs, like humans, have ways of dealing with stress. While you may binge chocolate, your dog may zone out and stare at the wall. Changes in environment — a move, new baby, or extended time away from you — can throw dogs into anxiety spirals. Staring at the wall may be a way for your pup to self-soothe or decompress when they feel anxious.\nHave you ever noticed how you squint when something is blurry and hard to see? Your dog may be doing the same thing at the wall. Vision problems can make ordinary objects look shadowy or distorted, explaining a dog’s hyper-focus on something you can’t see. A quick check-up with a veterinarian can rule out eye problems.\nStaring at the wall is sometimes the canine equivalent of saying something is wrong. It could indicate underlying health problems, like brain tumors, liver issues, or vestibular disease. Call your veterinarian immediately if the behavior is sudden, accompanied by lethargy, uncoordinated movements, or vomiting.\nBeyond the fact that they’re your biggest admirer.\nWhat should you do if your dog is staring at the wall?\nAssess the situation. Dogs are curious, sensitive creatures, and staring at the wall doesn’t always indicate something wrong. Observe their behavior and body language. Are they staring occasionally, or is it a new obsession? Are they acting like their usual tail-wagging, giddy selves? These initial clues can help you figure out what’s going on.\nBefore jumping to conclusions, check the wall. Look for anything that may grab your attention, like a light reflection, a small shadow or shimmer, a spider or other minor bug, or a weird, noticeable texture. Sometimes, it’s nothing more than a curious dog investigating their surroundings.\nDogs are creatures of habit and routine, so minor environmental disruptions can lead to odd, self-soothing behaviors, like staring at walls. Did you move the furniture? Have you brought home a new pet? Did you start using a new gadget that makes a strange noise? When stressed or anxious, dogs may exhibit anxiety by wall-staring or other quirky body language.\nIf the staring feels excessive, habitual, or compulsive, try to redirect your dog’s attention. Engage them in an activity they love, like playing fetch, solving a puzzle toy, or snuggling on the couch with you. If they are easily redirected, wall-staring may be a phase or a peculiar way for your dog to entertain themselves.\nIf this behavior persists, becomes more frequent, or includes concerning signs like pacing, whining, or ignoring everything else, consult a veterinarian. Document when and how often it happens, noting patterns and additional symptoms.\nStop them before a stare turns into a fight.\nWhen is it time to see a vet for an opinion?\nWhile occasional wall-staring can be chalked up to curiosity or quirky dog behavior, there are times when it’s more than a phase. Persistent or unusual wall-staring can indicate underlying medical or neurological issues that need immediate professional attention.\nIf you consult a vet, share your observations, including when the behavior started, how often it happens, and whether there are any changes in your dog’s health or routine. The vet will run tests like bloodwork and imaging, and possibly refer you to a specialist for further evaluation.\nBeing cautious is always best regarding your dog’s health. While staring at a wall may be nothing to cause concern, it could be a subtle way for your dog to tell you something. Be observant and proactive to ensure your pup remains happy, healthy, and more interested in their toys than your home’s drywall.\nReferences\nBurke, Angela, et al. “Why Is My Dog Staring at the Wall?” American Kennel Club, Jan 2020,www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/why-dog-staring-at-wall.\nBurke, Angela, et al. “Why Is My Dog Staring at the Wall?” American Kennel Club, Jan 2020,www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/why-dog-staring-at-wall.\n‌“Why Does My Dog Look at the Wall – [Vet Explains Pets].”Vetexplainspets.com, 2024,vetexplainspets.com/why-does-my-dog-look-at-the-wall.

  "page_content": "From champagne to parties to resolution list writing, New Year’s Eve can be lots of fun for humans. But when it comes to those gorgeous fireworks displays popping up around the country (or the amateur ones in our most adventurous neighbor’s backyard), our four-legged family members are a little less thrilled. Fireworks are a huge source of stress for dogs — and they can be a serious health hazard, too.\nYour pup deserves a joyful start to 2025, so we talked to Dr. Gabrielle Fadl, veterinarian and director of primary care atBond Vetin New York City, about the dangers of fireworks to dogs and how to keep your dog safe this holiday.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nWhy are dogs scared of fireworks?\nThe short answer:Loud noises can be frighteningto many dogsandcats. The booming blasts of fireworks are unpredictable and sudden, and fireworks are likely louder than most noises your pet is used to hearing. If you have a dog who’sfreaked out by thunderstorms,they will likely be scared of fireworks, too.\n“Similar to thunderstorms, fireworks causing loud, unpredictable noises can be interpreted as a threat to dogs, causing them to hide,show signs of anxiety(panting, trembling, pacing, whining), or run,” Dr. Fadl says.\nWith their bright lights and loud noises, fireworks can also createsensory overloadin animals, resulting in a panicked fight-or-flight response. Although there is no real threat, your pet doesn’t know that, and they may experience an adrenaline rush that results in rising blood pressure and a faster heart rate. This sense of danger causes some pets to attempt to escape or even react with aggression toward other animals and humans in the home.\nHow are fireworks dangerous to dogs?\nFireworks come with many risks for dogs, so it’s best to keep your pets safely inside during any New Year’s celebrations. In addition to a sense of fear and stress, dogs who are outside unattended during fireworks displays run the risk of becoming burned, injured, or even ingesting lit or used fireworks.\nFear and anxiety can lead your dog to make a run for it. “If dogs are not properly restrained, dogs can get loose and run away in an attempt to find safety,” Dr. Fadl says. “As a result, dogs can get lost or injured while attempting to climb or dig to escape these sounds.”\nEven if your dog happens to be chill about fireworks, allowing them outside while you’re lighting sparklers can be dangerous. Dogs may not realize the danger of lit fireworks and get too close, which can result in burns to the face or even the inside of the mouth if they attempt to ingest a lit firework.\n“The same precautions that you would take when using fireworks around young children should also be taken with your pets,” Dr. Fadl adds. “That means making sure fireworks are not being set off with pets nearby and able to get near hazardous sparks, flames, or strong smoke or odors.”\nHealth issues related to ingesting fireworks\nFireworks don’t even have to be lit to cause injury to your pet. When roaming the yard after a firework display, dogs may ingest debris or pieces of used fireworks, which contain dangerous chemicals, such as heavy metals, sulfur, and coloring agents. Eating fireworks can cause serious health issues for dogs, such asgastrointestinal distressor even muscle and nerve dysfunction, which can result in permanent damage.\nYou probably don’t need to worry about cats ingesting fireworks because they tend to be more discriminating eaters and likely won’t attempt to eat a used firework. But you should always clean up all used fireworks and debris in your yard before allowing your pets outside again.\nTips for comforting your pup when the storm is too loud for your pup’s comfort.\nTips for keeping your dog calm and safe during fireworks displays\nIf you know that your dog is scared of loud noises, make sure to have a plan for soothing your pet during New Year celebrations and know how to calm a dog during fireworks. Start by keeping your dog away from any nearby firework displays and safely cozied up in the house. If you live in a cold climate, your pet should be safely inside anyway, but make sure you have them in a place in the house where they feel safe when they hear loud noises.\nWell before New Year’s Eve comes around, yourpet should be microchippedand have an ID tag on their collar featuring your current contact information. No one expects their dog to run away, but fireworks can make your pet’s behavior unpredictable, so it’s best to take precautions. Ensuring your dog has proper identification can improve the chances that they will be returned to you if they do become lost.\nOne of the best ways to calm your dog during fireworks is to make a space in your home for them to feel safe and comfortable. Choose a space with no windows, like the inside of a large closet or a bathroom, and create a cozy cave where your dog can hide from the noise and lights of the fireworks. You can even use a crate if your dog already feels safe there. Give your pup some of their favorite toys and treats so they feel at home and (hopefully) more relaxed.\n“If you can, try to engage your dog in a playful or fun activity, such as a training or play session,beforethe noises are expected to begin,” Dr. Fadl suggests. “Using positive reinforcement, like rewarding calm behaviors with treats or affection, can be helpful in a sound-phobic dog.”\nSoft, soothing noises can be an antidote to the loud bangs of fireworks. Try leaving some kind of white noise — like the TV or radio — on to help cover the sounds of any firework displays and give your dog something else to focus on. You can even find soothing white noise playlists, including somespecifically designed for dogs,on YouTube and Spotify.\nYour pup might want company; leaving your pet alone during fireworks can sometimes make them even more stressed. If you can, stay home with your dog to help them feel safer and comfort them if they show signs of stress or fear. Pet your pup with long, slow strokes along the length of their body and avoid any behaviors that seem frantic. Try to keep your voice and your movements calm and reassuring to show your dog that they’re safe with you.\nThere’s nothing to fear but fear itself — and a dog who won’t stop shaking when it thunders.\nIf your pet’s anxiety is especially severe and none of the above solutions seem to help, talk to your veterinarian about other treatment options. Your dog may benefit from anti-anxiety medication, which your vet can prescribe, and you may also want to ask about over-the-counter options, like dog-calming treats, anxiety vests likeThundershirts, or CBD products. Never, ever give your dogover-the-counter medicationwithout consulting a vet, and always be sure theCBD productsyou use are completely free of THC and approved for pets.\n“Some dogs are so severely impacted by noises that anxiolytic or sedating medication may be needed to help keep them calm and prevent them from harming themselves,” Dr. Fadl says. “There are many safe options, as well as FDA-approved medication for dogs with noise aversion. Speak to your veterinarian as soon as possible about which medication may be best for your dog.”\nEven after the fireworks show is over, you still need to keep your dog safe from the possibility of poisoning. Make sure to clean up all used fireworks and any debris in your yard, whether you shot the fireworks or not, before you let your dog outside again.\nKeep your dog safe this New Year’s Day (and every day).\nFireworks may be awe-inspiring and fun for you, but they can be incredibly stressful and even dangerous to your dog. Take precautions to help your pup feel safe this holiday and have a plan to ensure that your dog avoids the hazards of fireworks and remains happy and healthy.\nReferences:\nFear of Thunderstorms and Fireworks\nFear of Thunderstorms and Fireworks\nHow to Keep Your Dog Calm During Fireworks\nHow to Keep Your Dog Calm During Fireworks\n10 Ways to Calm Your Dog During Fireworks\n10 Ways to Calm Your Dog During Fireworks\nHow to Keep Your Dog Safe During Fireworks\nHow to Keep Your Dog Safe During Fireworks",

  "page_content": "Dogs love to lick everything, even when we don’t necessarily want them to.Our faces, furniture, and forsome dogs,our legsare prime licking real estate. If your dog loves to lick your legs, you might be wondering why they do it — and whether it’s normal.\nRest assured, it’s nothing to worry about. But you can stop them from doing it if it bothers you. Here’s how.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nMain takeaways\nDogs licking your legs is totally normal and nothing to worry about.\nDogs licking your legs is totally normal and nothing to worry about.\nYour dog might lick your legs as a sign of affection.\nYour dog might lick your legs as a sign of affection.\nYour dog might think that you taste good.\nYour dog might think that you taste good.\nIs it normal for dogs to lick their pet parent’s legs?\nYour legs are a part of you, and your dog is communicating to you the same way they would if they licked you anywhere else. Rachel Rodgers, a clinical animal behaviorist and the founder ofNose to Trail, explains: “It’s not ‘abnormal’ in the sense of it being detrimental to a dog’s health and potentially dangerous, but it is not the most common of behaviors. Some dogs will do it, others won’t.” Rodgers, who has two dogs, finds that one licks her feet, while the other one has no interest at all.\nThe sentiment is nice, but...\n6 common reasons why your dog licks your legs\nThe number one reason why your dog licks your legs? They love you. Your dog is interested in every part of you, and licking is one way that they’re communicating this affection. (They don’t have words, so we have to listen to the other ways they express themselves.) “Any kind of licking by a dog could be a sign of affection, similar to how they may interact with other dogs,” says Rodgers. However, context is important.\nDogs love attention, and licking is one way that they get it, particularly if you put up a fuss, scream, or laugh when they lick you. That positive reinforcement means that they will continue to lick your legs, as long as it gets your attention.\nSweat is salty, and dogs love the taste of salt. In particular, if you’ve just woken up or worked out, your dog might be licking your legs to get that sweet sweat taste. “Some dogs just enjoy the taste of your sweat,” says Rodgers. And that’s nothing to worry about at all.\nIf you’ve put on lotion, your dog might be licking you because the taste is interesting. Alternatively, they might be licking you to try and get rid of the weird, foreign smell on your body — they want you to smell more like a familiar member of their pack again.\nIn a similar vein, your dog might actually be grooming you. Rodgers says this isn’t common, because dogs don’t groom as thoroughly as cats do. “At the end of the day, our dogs know that we aren’t dogs too,” says Rodgers. “However, they can learn from other animals to do this and have seen their mother licking siblings when they were young.”\nLicking behaviors are comforting to dogs, and they might be licking your legs as a way to self-soothe or comfort themselves. Says Rodgers, “Dogs can do this as an appeasing behavior, something they do when they’re a little worried.” This is particularly true if they’ve done something wrong. Still, if it bothers you, it’s OK to try to get them to stop (see below), no matter how much they like it.\nThat’s cute... sort of?\nWhen to be concerned about licking\nYou shouldn’t worry too much about your dog’s licking behaviors. But if it seems excessive or compulsive, this might be a sign of a deeper issue. If it seems like a new behavior that’s unusual for them, you should contact your vet.\n“It is also important to consider the length of time a dog spends licking your legs,” Rodgers says. “If this is something they are doing for considerable periods of time, several times a day, every day — then we want to start looking at why they are doing this, as it could be they are feeling a bit anxious or stressed.”\nHow to train your dog to stop licking your legs\nIf your dog licks your legs too much and you want to stop them, don’t encourage the behavior. Walk away and don’t positively reinforce the licking through laughter or playing with them. Rodgers says that all behavior is made up of the ABCs: “A” for antecedent (what happens before), “B” for the behavior, and “C” for consequence. “The intervention point needs to be at point A. To break this habit, change the cycle of what happens before.” She also recommends having an enrichment device you’re ready to give them, like a lick mat or Kong smothered in something tastier than your sweat.\nBottom line\nThere are tons of reasons why your dog might love to lick your legs. Maybe they’re expressing love and affection, maybe they want attention, maybe they’re actually grooming you. Regardless, you don’t really need to worry about the behavior unless it seems excessive to you.\nFAQs\nYou may find that your dog seems to lick your legs more when it’s first thing in the morning. This could simply be because you’re a little sweaty from sleeping and they like the taste.\nGenerally, licking isn’t anything to worry about. But if your dog is doing it excessively or much more than usual, this could be a sign of gastrointestinal issues. When in doubt, contact your vet. “It is often seen more as an emotional response to things rather than a health problem in itself,” says Rodgers, reassuringly.\nOne reason why a dog might lick you when you get out of the shower is because you smell weird to them. They’re trying to get the foreign scents of shower gels and other products off you. You might also just smell exciting and tasty to them.\nYour dog licks you so much because they love you, and it feels good to them. They’re being affectionate and playful, and they don’t realize it can get a little gross for you. Adds Rodgers: “We have to remember dogs don’t have hands. They don’t explore the world with their paws. They often use their mouths instead, particularly puppies. Sometimes this becomes a habit they start from an early age.”",

  },
  "page_content": "Pet parents see their dogs do a lot of weird things, like spinning in a circle before they lie down, sticking their noses in people’s crotches, or getting the zoomies after a bath. Sometimes, dogs are just being dogs with unique quirks and habits, but often, there is a reason for specific behaviors.\nNail biting is one of those. If your dog is biting their nails, it is likely for a reason, whether that’s anxiety, allergies, or nail length discomfort. If they are biting their nails excessively, consult a vet to rule out any underlying health issues.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nFivesimple steps for trimming your dog’s nails at home.\nWhy do dogs bite their nails?\nTo explore some of the common reasons dogs might bite their nails, we consulted Lucia Lazarowski, CAAB, Chief Behavioral Scientist with Auburn University’s Canine Performance Sciences program, and Mary Huntsberry, ACAAB, owner ofHelping Pets Behave.\nA dog may chew their nails because they are overgrown. Nails that are left untrimmedcan cause discomfort, broken nails, and even mobility issues in dogs. If nails are so long that they are the first part of a dog’s foot that touches the ground, it can inhibit traction or alter the way the dog’s foot sits on the ground. When nails are overgrown and uncomfortable, dogs may chew or bite them to try to fix the discomfort, the same way they might lick a wound.\nAnother cause for dog nail chewing could be a nail injury, such as abroken nail, that a dog is trying to fix or soothe. When a dog’s nail breaks, it can split up toward the toe, potentially exposing the quick and causing pain. An exposed quick can also become a risk for infection.\n“If they break or they get something stuck in the nail, they’ll actually bite the nail themselves to fix it and that’s just a normal grooming type of behavior,” Lazarowski says.\nBreaks are more common in overgrown nails, so pet parents can avoid unnecessary discomfort and risk of infections by keeping their dog’s nails trimmed.\nDogs who lick or bite their paws may do so as result ofenvironmental allergies. Just like humans, dogs can react to certain environmental allergens like pollen, mold spores, dust mites, grass, and more. Because their paws can be exposed to these allergens when dogs go outside or on walks, they may experience skin irritation on their paws and try to clean and soothe them bylicking or nibbling.\nDogs’ paws are regularly exposed to conditions that can lead to infection — just imagine what could happen to your toes if you spent an hour walking barefoot on a sidewalk. Infections can manifest in itchy and irritated skin, which dogs will often attempt to soothe and clean with their mouths. However, this behavior can make the infection worse, not better.\nDogs who are anxious may chew their nails as a self-soothing behavior. Observe when your dog engages in nail chewing. If it happens when they are left alone or when there is a change in surroundings, it may be due to anxiety. Look for othersigns of anxiety, such as excessive panting, pacing, or tense body posture.\n“Sometimes it can be driven from anxiety, just like humans bite their nails as a stress relief or tension release,” Lazarowski says. “Dogs learn that by doing that, it’s relieving anxiety, then that becomes kind of self-rewarding and then they develop a habit and keep doing that.”\nSimilar to an infection, a disease or other medical condition may be the cause of nail biting. Certain conditions, such asflea dermatitisor demodectic mange, can cause irritation and itching around the paws.\n“There are parasites that can cause dogs to want to chew at their skin and their paws are easily accessible to nibble at so there’s definitely sometimes a health-related reason,” Lazarowski says.\nKeeping your dog up-to-date on their heartworm, flea and tick, and otherpreventative medicationsand visiting the vet regularly can prevent some diseases and medical conditions before they occur.\nHow do I get my dog to stop chewing their nails?\nLike many dog behaviors, a few seconds of nail biting or chewing can be okay. It’s when it becomes excessive that there’s a problem. If your dog is chewing their nails excessively, you are probably better off consulting a vet before taking matters into your own hands.\n“Since joint pain, allergies, yeast, etc. can infiltrate the forelegs and paws, it is important that the pet receive veterinary evaluation before assuming the cause is behavioral,” Huntsberry says.\nIf you’ve ruled out an underlying medical condition, the following strategies may help curb the behavior:\nIf your dog seems to be chewing their nails as a self-soothing behavior, find something else that provides the same stress relief, like a chew toy or an interactive mental toy.\n“There are puzzle feeders or toys you can stuff with kibble so instead of your dog relieving boredom or anxiety by chewing their own nails, they can manipulate something else that’s more appropriate, giving them something else to do,” Lazarowski says.\nFor dogs who resort to nail chewing because their nails are overgrown, keeping them trimmed may be a solution.Trimming your dog’s nailscan be challenging, since many dogs are afraid of it. Lazarowski suggests early exposure so that puppies get used to nail clippers and don’t become afraid:\n“You can introduce it very gradually by just showing them the clippers and giving them some treats,” she says. “They learn that the clippers are nothing scary. Then gradually progress to touching their paws with the clippers, and if they’re allowing that and not seeming to get nervous or stressed out, you can progress through the steps towards actually clipping their nails, meanwhile always giving them treats and positive association.”\nWhen trimming a dog’s nails, be careful not to cut too far, or you risk cutting their quick, the inner part of the nail that can cause pain andbleeding if cut. Note that the quick grows with the nail, so it can become lengthy if the nails aren’t regularly trimmed, which can make it difficult to cut your dog’s nails short without injuring them. Getting your dog on a nail maintenance schedule and trimming every three to four weeks can train the quick to retract and allow you to keep your dog’s nails short.\nWhen in doubt, consult a professional. Groomers are usually very experienced in trimming nails and can make the experience less stressful for you and your pup. Some groomers may use a dremel, a tool that grinds the nails down gradually as opposed to clipping them. Depending on the dog, this may be less fear-inducing than a clipper.\nYou can try washing your dog’s feet to prevent nail chewing. This may be especially effective for dogs who are biting their nails because of allergies or having something stuck in their paw. Observe your dog to see when they begin chewing. If it usually happens after being outside or on a walk, try washing their feet when they come inside to see if that solves the issue.\nIf the reason your dog is chewing their nails is anxiety, exercise may be a positive outlet for that anxious energy. As the saying goes, a tired dog is a good dog. Make sure they are getting plenty of walks, fetch, and stimulation to ensure their minds and bodies are tired enough that they don’t turn to nail biting or other anxiety-driven behaviors.\nShould you go to the vet because of your dog’s nail biting?\nBecause dogs usually bite their nails for a reason, it is a good idea to consult a veterinarian to rule out any underlying health issues. Nail biting may be a sign of parasites, anxiety, allergies, or some other issue that needs to be addressed. Waiting to go to the vet, or assuming nail biting is just a quirky habit of your dog and not taking action, could cause the issue to get worse.\nHuntsberry advises watching for how long your dog participates in the behavior: “Biting and chewing nails is not a normal behavior for dogs,” she says. “Aside from self-cleaning, any licking or chewing past 10 to 15 seconds is usually a sign of a medical condition.”\nA vet explains when you can treat the injury at home — and when it’s best to seek professional help.\nFAQs\nYour dog is likely chewing their nails for a reason. Identify the underlying issue and work with a veterinarian to treat the problem. For example, if they are chewing their nails because they are overgrown, start a nail trimming routine.\nNail chewing in excess is not a normal behavior and is likely signaling an underlying problem, such as allergies, overgrown nails, or an infection. If your dog is excessively chewing their nails, consult a veterinarian.\nIf your dog is excessively biting their nails, you should consult a veterinarian. If your dog is only biting their nails occasionally for a few seconds and they are not causing damage to their paws, they might not need a vet. If you can identify the cause, you can try to resolve it yourself, for example, by trimming their nails or washing their paws.\nReferences\nArhant, Christine, et al. “Chewing Behaviour in Dogs – a Survey-Based Exploratory Study.”Applied Animal Behaviour Science, vol. 241, Aug. 2021, p. 105372,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2021.105372.\nArhant, Christine, et al. “Chewing Behaviour in Dogs – a Survey-Based Exploratory Study.”Applied Animal Behaviour Science, vol. 241, Aug. 2021, p. 105372,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2021.105372.\nMarkey, Nathan. “Trimming Dogs’ Nails | Why It’s Important & Tips for Anxiety.”Tier 1 Veterinary Medical Center, 15 Feb. 2021,tier1vet.com/trimming-dogs-nails/.\nMarkey, Nathan. “Trimming Dogs’ Nails | Why It’s Important & Tips for Anxiety.”Tier 1 Veterinary Medical Center, 15 Feb. 2021,tier1vet.com/trimming-dogs-nails/.\nWeir, Malcolm, et al. “Allergies in Dogs.”Vca_corporate,vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/allergy-general-in-dogs.\nWeir, Malcolm, et al. “Allergies in Dogs.”Vca_corporate,vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/allergy-general-in-dogs.",

But that doesn’t make it less awkward.\nDog humpingcan make everyone feel weird. It’s just so awkward, especially when your dog has chosen to mount the pup of the most judgy person at the park. Do you step in and intervene? Do you let the dogs work it out themselves while you try not to stare? Read on to learn about some strategies to navigate these cringe-worthy moments.\nTake these steps to respond to the problem.\nWhy do dogs hump?\nHumping is a normal dog behavior that occurs in a variety of contexts between dogs. Technically referred to as mounting, it tends to happen when a dog’s arousal, or excitement level, is very high. The biological instinct to hump is to reproduce, but it can occur in many other contexts, too. Here are some of those motivations.\nA dog’s basic instinct to mount another dog is typically tied to a hormone-fueled drive to reproduce. Intact female dogs go into heat, during which time they are receptive to mating, and intact male dogs can sense this. This triggers a very strong instinct to mate, and thus mounting ensues. Dogs who are spayed and neutered have a muted sex drive, but some may still become aroused and attempt to mount. Females will not go into heat if they are spayed.\nMounting can be a normalpart of playbetween dogs, too. When they play, dogs may act out instinctive, but out-of-context behaviors, including play fighting, hunting, and even mounting. In this setting, mounting is usually brief, and dogs should not be showing signs of distress.\nSometimes dogs use mounting as a way to keep order or guide another dog’s actions within theirsocial group. They may do this to stop another dog from moving in a specific direction or to keep a dog still.\nHumping can also be a displacement behavior, one performed out of context as an outlet for pent-up energy. This may occur when dogs are in an unfamiliar environment and feel unsure of what to do, or because theyfeel especially fearfulor excited.\nSome dogs also mount other dogs or even inanimate objects due to underlying anxiety. This is also a displacement behavior.\nA dog may also hump due to a medical problem. Most commonly, this isrelated to painor discomfort in their urinary tract, genital area, or around their anus.\nCommon myths about why dogs hump\nThere are some myths that only intact male dogs hump and that neutering will completely solve this problem. The truth is that neutering can help, especially when it is done before dogs reach sexual maturity. However, both male and female dogs can engage in mounting behavior, even if they arespayed and neutered.\nAnother common misconception is that mounting is always related to dominance and that more dominant dogs will always mount more submissive dogs. This ignores the many nuanced reasons why dogs mount one another, in addition to people and/or inanimate objects, which can make it much harder to find targeted solutions.\nThis simple dog training skill could save your dog’s life.\nHere’s how to deal with a dog who’s humping other dogs\nMany times, mounting upsets people more than it upsets dogs, so try not to anthropomorphize too much if you see your pup engaging in behaviors that might get a human arrested.\nThe behavior in play may be borrowed from other contexts — such as fighting, hunting, and mating. So determining whether or not a behavior is appropriate play, awkward and inappropriate attempts to play, or something else altogether is not always completely straightforward. Here are some guidelines to determine when to intervene.\nIt’s only play ifeveryoneinvolved is having fun. That means you should intervene and stop the behavior if you seebody languagethat suggests one of the dogs is trying to avoid the interaction orclearly not having a good time, or if you are concerned one of the dogs may get injured.\nInterrupting a humping dog is easier said than done. If your dog won’tcome when calledor back off when told to “leave it,” you may have to physically lead them away. In these cases, redirect your pup to another activity such as a toy or other dogs to play with.\nMounting can be a sign that your pup is overstimulated, whether from excitement, fear, or uncertainty. If your pup can’t find a constructive outlet for those feelings, the best thing for them may be to leave the situation andallow them to calm down. Your dog may just get too excited at thedog parkand is much calmer when only one or two other dogs are around.\nHow to train your dog to stop humping\nThe most effective strategies to stop humping are targeted at the underlying cause of the behavior. Be sure to pay close attention to the situations that seem to set your pup off, and try to understand the pattern. Here are some strategies to try.\nThe first step is to understand why your dog is humping. Does this seem to be happening at certain times, in certain places, and/or with certain dogs? Learn the patterns, so you can be on the lookout for triggers and work to avoid them and/or redirect your pup in those situations.\nIf you catch your dog in the act, calmly redirect them towards a more acceptable activity. This can be as simple as asking your dog to perform a trained cue on command or giving them a toy to play with instead.\nIf you know what is triggering your pup, try to help them find better outlets for that energy. For example, if your dog is getting overstimulated at the dog park, maybe they need more exercise andgeneral enrichmentbefore heading out there. Or maybe they need to stick to smaller playgroups and avoid the dog park altogether. If your dog seems nervous or unsure of how to interact in certain settings,work on teaching them cuesto show them what kinds of behaviors you want them to do instead — such as cues to sit, lay down, or go to their mat.\nPunishment is not a productive way to deter humping, because it may increase your dog’s frustration and anxiety. Additionally, if you draw more attention to the behavior by making a big deal out of it, you may unintentionally reinforce the behavior. Negative attention is still attention, and dogs may associate the behavior with increased attention from you.\nWhat to do when dog humping becomes a problem\nIf your dog’s humping behavior is excessive and/or interfering with their normal activities, it is important to work on figuring out the underlying cause and finding effective solutions. Be sure to see your vet to rule out medical causes, and discuss spaying or neutering if your pup is intact.\nIf your vet agrees that this is a behavioral problem and you have not had success using the training techniques listed here, it may be time to seek professional help from a behaviorist.Working with a certified behavioristcan help you hone in on your dog’s underlying motivations and find solutions for you and your pup.\nDoes spaying and neutering stop humping behavior?\nNot necessarily, but it can help. Dogs who are intact have an added reason to hump: Their sex drive is much higher as a result of hormonal influences, and they are more likely to hump in an attempt to actually mate. Spaying and neutering will decrease this impulse to hump, because their sex drive will be dramatically reduced. However, spayed and neutered dogs might still hump for many other reasons that are not impacted by spaying and neutering.\nBottom line\nMounting is a normal canine behavior in many contexts.\nMounting is a normal canine behavior in many contexts.\nIt is important to note the triggers that set your dog’s humping behavior into overdrive.\nIt is important to note the triggers that set your dog’s humping behavior into overdrive.\nIn cases where your dog’s humping becomes excessive or puts other dogs on the defensive, you’ll want to intervene.\nIn cases where your dog’s humping becomes excessive or puts other dogs on the defensive, you’ll want to intervene.\nSeek help if you can’t determine their exact triggers or need support in finding solutions that work for your pup.\nSeek help if you can’t determine their exact triggers or need support in finding solutions that work for your pup.\nFAQs\nIn most cases, humping is a neutral behavior that is neither good nor bad. It is a normal behavior that dogs engage in regularly. However, if your dog seems to do this excessively, or if they are getting into conflicts with other dogs as a result of this behavior, it may have a negative impact on them.\nSometimes dogs hump when they are happy or excited. Other times, it can be a sign of anxiety or overstimulation.\nThere is no specific age when humping behavior stops, and some dogs do it for their whole lives. Adolescent dogs who have recently reached sexual maturity are more likely to hump, but it can happen at any age.\nHumping can sometimes be a sign of aggression or dominance, but there are many other possible reasons for this behavior, too. It is important to look at what else is going on during these interactions, and how the dogs are reacting, to know what is motivating the behavior.\nReferences\nBergman, Laurie. “Canine mounting: an overview.”Clinician’s Brief, January 2012, pp. 61-63.\nBergman, Laurie. “Canine mounting: an overview.”Clinician’s Brief, January 2012, pp. 61-63.\nDidehban, Negar, et al. “Problematic behaviors in companion dogs: A survey of their prevalence and associated factors.”Journal of Veterinary Behavior, vol. 39, September-October 2020, pp. 6-13.\nDidehban, Negar, et al. “Problematic behaviors in companion dogs: A survey of their prevalence and associated factors.”Journal of Veterinary Behavior, vol. 39, September-October 2020, pp. 6-13.\nNorris, Breanna. “Why does my dog hump?”Cattle Dog Publishing,26 June 2023.\nNorris, Breanna. “Why does my dog hump?”Cattle Dog Publishing,26 June 2023.",

You get to experience the similarities and differences of animals and may even witness a budding cross-species friendship. However, there are some downsides — some behaviors you could do without.

Even if considered normal, mounting can quickly become inappropriate, especially if your dog is humping your cat. It can be very stressful for your cat and may even cause injury. So, what is behind a dog’s urge to hump the felines in your household? Let’s delve into this.\nReasons why your dog is humping your cat\nMounting is a normal activity on a puppy’s playlist. Littermates will often mount each other during play or singular puppies will mount their toys or even their people. Play mounting may be a puppy’s way of figuring out what they are doing before their first sexual encounter.\nHumping brought on by play will often take the form of a happy play session for both sides that then turns into your dog humping your cat when things get escalated. In this scenario, your dog may play with them as they would with a dog. Remembering play sessions from when they were young, they are wrestling with their littermates and “practicing” for what may come in the future.\nDogs not properly socialized may be more likely to mount other animals during play. They can get overly excited about the invitation and then not realize what’s appropriate behavior when wrestling around. Socializing your dog at a young age can help them better understand what is acceptable when playing with other animals.\nAnxiety and stress can also play a role in your dog humping your cat. Everyone responds to stress differently, as we know from our human lives. Some dogs may respond to stress or anxiety by going through repetitive motions, such as humping.\nIf stress is the culprit, you may notice your dog seeking out your cat when a visitor shows up, if the travel crate makes an appearance, or if you’re late in taking them for a walk or feeding them. If your dog is humping in response to stress, it can turn into acompulsive disorderwhere they resort to humping as a calming mechanism that can get out of hand.\nDogs are quick learners, making the old saying, “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks” a bit of a misnomer. No matter their age, dogs figure out that certain behaviors get a response from you, whether good or bad. If you have reprimanded your dog or even intervened when they were humping your cat, they may repeat the behavior when they really want to get your attention.\nMaybe you forgot to greet them when you got home or you haven’t taken them to the dog park for a few days. Humping the cat may be their way of saying, “Look at me, I need something from you now.”\nAnimals in the same household like to form a hierarchy, even animals of different species. Someone has to be in charge, and others have to follow that leader. It can sometimes be difficult for dogs and cats to come to the same hierarchical conclusion, and one surefire way that your dog can show they should be the one on top is to make your cat look small and meek. Your dog humping your cat may be their way of putting your cat in what your dog views as their lower place.\nBesides humping, animals who are having a hard time establishing a hierarchy may have frequent spats, especially when it comes to sharing resources.\nOf course, the most obvious cause of humping would be sexual behavior, so if your dog isn’tspayed or neutered, that may be the reason. However, other health-related issues can also cause humping. Things like urinary tract issues and skin irritation can play out as your dog humping your cat. Be sure to see a veterinarian if your dog’s humping behavior pops up suddenly or if you’re noticing any other abnormal signs.\nHow to train your dog not to hump your cat\nIf your dog humping your cat has become bothersome, it’stime to do something about it. You don’t want your kitty to become stressed or injured, and you want to make sure your pup has appropriate interactions.\nStart by determining the cause, if possible.

Even if your dog and cat are equally matched, it can still be a big source of stress and conflict, so it’s best to curb your dog’s humping behavior.\nHumping in a dog is often not a sexual behavior but can be driven by stress, excitement, or dominance. However, if your dog isn’t neutered, their hormones may be responsible. Seek veterinary advice to find out what is behind your dog humping your cat.\nHumping may be considered a normal behavior, but most dogs learn when it’s inappropriate. That means if your dog is humping your cat, it may be due to feelings of stress, anxiety, or difficulty with their living situation. Try to stick to a consistent routine that includes plenty of one-on-one time with your dog, and give them a safe space that is all their own to decrease stress in their lives.\nReferences\n“Inappropriate Mounting.”Clinical Animal Behavioral Service,UC Davis Veterinary Medicine,https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk491/files/inline-files/Inappropriate_Mounting_in_Dogs.pdf.\n“Inappropriate Mounting.”Clinical Animal Behavioral Service,UC Davis Veterinary Medicine,https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk491/files/inline-files/Inappropriate_Mounting_in_Dogs.pdf.\nLindell, Ellen, VMD, DACVB; Debra Horwitz, DVM, DACVB and Gary Landsberg, DVM, DACVB, DECAWBM. “Compulsive Disorders in Dogs.”VCA Animal Hospitals.https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/compulsive-disorders-in-dogs.\nLindell, Ellen, VMD, DACVB; Debra Horwitz, DVM, DACVB and Gary Landsberg, DVM, DACVB, DECAWBM. “Compulsive Disorders in Dogs.”VCA Animal Hospitals.https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/compulsive-disorders-in-dogs.\n“Mounting and Masturbation.”ASPCA,https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/common-dog-behavior-issues/mounting-and-masturbation.\n“Mounting and Masturbation.”ASPCA,https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/common-dog-behavior-issues/mounting-and-masturbation.",

While it’s not socially acceptable to us, your dog does what comes naturally to her. There are several different reasons why female or male dogs hump, and we’re going to give you the top six reasons.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nSix reasons why your female dog is humping\nWhile we can share with you themain reasonsyour female dog is humping, you have to assess the situation under which she does it to understand the behavior entirely. To change the behavior, you need to figure out the underlying cause.\nIt is fairly common for humping behavior in female dogs to occurduring play.It mayseem strange,but in the context of play, humping can be a form of communication or just a response to excitement. This particularly occurs in younger dogs exploring their boundaries and learning social cues. As they play with another dog, they can get overly excited or aroused, which may indicate the need to release pent-up energy.  Humping can also mimic other play behaviors, such as wrestling or chasing. It’s rarely a cause for concern.\nWhile it is often said that humping indicates a need to establish dominance, that is rarely true. It can happen, especially in group play situations where dogs may need to assert control. However, the other reasons for humping are much more common.\nIf not spayed, your female dog is simply doing what comes naturally. Even if you have had your female dog spayed, it can take up to three months for all the residual hormone activity to leave her body. Humping can also occur due to habit.\nHumping can be a way for your pup to relieve stress or anxiety. This can occur due to stress from anything she’s uneasy about or can occur during play if the environment becomes overwhelming.\nWhile this is uncommon, it can happen. Medical conditions such as urinary tract infections or hormonal imbalances can result in humping. If a medical problem is a cause, you will probably see constant or obsessive humping accompanied by licking, swelling, or physical discomfort.\nThere are a few other reasons for a female dog to hump, such as habit or learned behavior and attention-seeking. Even if your reaction is adverse, it’s a type of attention.\nDebunking myths around female dog humping\nThere are some common misunderstandings about female dog humping, which can lead to continuing what you may view as undesirable behavior. It’s essential to understand the real reasons for dog humping if you are going to try to make a change.\nThis is a myth. There are several reasons for female dog humping, including the common ones we have gone over. The most common cause of dog humping is excitement or non-sexual overstimulation.\nThis is also a myth. Dominance is actually one of the rarest reasons for humping. Occasionally humping can be an attempt at dominance, especially in group play. Otherwise, it is rarely a reason for humping. The other reasons are far more common.\nWhile this can be true, there are many times humping doesn’t stop right after spaying. There can be residual hormones in your dog’s body for up to three months after the surgery. During this time, your female dog may continue to hump. Humping can also be a learned behavior that will persist unless you actively train your dog not to hump, which may require a specialized trainer.\nHow to train your female dog not to hump\nEven though you know now that most female humping behavior is normal, you may still want itto stop. Try the following steps tostop the behavior:\nUse activities, commands, or toys as a distraction if your female dog starts humping.\nUse activities, commands, or toys as a distraction if your female dog starts humping.\nUse commands such as “leave it” to interfere with the behavior and redirect your dog to something else.\nUse commands such as “leave it” to interfere with the behavior and redirect your dog to something else.\nDiscourage your dog from playing too roughly and getting overly excited.\nDiscourage your dog from playing too roughly and getting overly excited.\nEnrichment can occupy your dog’s mind and interfere with the thought of humping.

If your dog is humping excessively or obsessively, it may be time to call the vet. If the humping is accompanied by your dog licking at her genitals or straining to urinate, swelling, or physical discomfort, it’s time to consult with a veterinarian. Your dog could have a urinary tract infection or hormonal imbalance.\nFinal thoughts: it’s likely perfectly fine that your female dog is humping\nIn most cases, it’s perfectly normal for your female dog to hump, especially during moments of excitement, play, or overstimulation.

They’re naturally pretty clean animals, so you can leave them in thecrate overnight, and they probably won’t have an accident. “It can also help with chewing … confining them in their crate means they cannot chew furniture or your things when you’re not able to watch them,” Kasperowicz says.\nIt can also be beneficial post-surgery, like afterspaying or neutering. “Some dogs may need restricted exercise and crate-training can help with that,” she says.

If they chew quite a lot, you shouldn’t choose a fabric crate. If they’re sound-sensitive, metal might be scary or unsettling to them. Generally, a strong metal or plastic crate is ideal, then you can choose whether or not to cover it based on their preference.\nThe crate should give your puppy more than enough room to stand up, turn around, and walk in. (Be mindful of not goingtoobig, because if they’re not yet potty trained, they could relieve themselves on one end and sleep on the other.) You also need to consider whether or not you’re planning on keeping them crate-trained into adulthood. If your pup is housebroken, you can choose a crate that will fit them at their fully grown size, giving them enough room to move around.\nStep-by-step guide for successfully crate-training your puppy\nStart by introducing your puppy to the crate and establishing a positive association with it. Kasperowicz says that you should feed your puppy in their crate, put treats in there at random times, and put some of their favorite toys and blankets in there. You can also try loading a closed crate with lots of fun things, such as treats and toys. “When your dog is begging to get in there, you can finally let them in to enjoy the goodies,” she says.\nA closed crate could easily feel like a prison to an energetic, anxious little puppy. So you need to make that crate a positive place. The more it feels like home, the more your puppy will choose to retreat into it. “When you introduce your crate, place a nice comfy bed in there and cover the top and sides of the crate,” Kasperowicz says. “Place some treats, chews, and toys in there and make the crate a nice, inviting place to be. Sit next to the crate and see if your puppy will investigate it. Reward them when they do.”\nOnce they’ve been introduced to the crate and have spent some time investigating it, it’s time to close the door. This is a hard step, as they may panic that they’re being shut in or abandoned. Do it when they’re distracted, and try to do this discreetly. They may not even notice that the door is closed if they’re having enough fun.\nAfter you’ve gotten your puppy used to having the door closed while they’re in the crate, the most important step is to leave them alone in there. “If your puppy goes to sleep in their crate of their own accord, you can close the door and leave your puppy until they wake,” Kasperowicz says. “If you are building up to leaving your puppy in its crate during the day, put them in their crate with a toy and a nice chew.”\nTry to leave your puppy in the crate for a while, and before they start to beg to be let out, just open the door. Try not to make a big deal out of it — if they feel like being let out is a reward, they may not develop a positive relationship with being inside the crate.\nEventually, you want to build their time inside the crate to a point where you can leave them overnight or when you go out to work. Kasperowicz adds: “Build up the time from 15 minutes, for example, then gradually increase it to 30 minutes, then 45, then 60, etc.” Eventually, you should be able to leave them in their crates for longer amounts of time.\nHow long does it take to crate-train your puppy?\nKasperowicz says that each dog is different. You may be able to immediately leave your puppy in their crate, or they may be a little more clingy and not want to be in there without you. It should only take a few days (or perhaps weeks) to get them comfortable being inside their crates for longer periods.\nCommon crate-training challenges and how to avoid them\nWhen it comes to leaving your puppy in their crate, it may be useful to cover it completely, Kasperowicz says. “Some dogs can get frustrated when they can see you but not get to you, so covering it means they may settle and switch off easier if they can’t see out.” This should limit how much they whine or bark in the crate.\nIf your dog gets very anxious or distressed in the crate, Kasperowicz says you shouldn’t leave them in there. Build up the time gradually, and never leave them in the crate when they’re distressed. They should be able to get over any initial crate anxiety with time.\nIf your dog has an accident inside their crate, you shouldn’t punish them. In the future, try to make sure they’ve peed and pooped before they even get in there, and never leave them in their mess. Clean it up thoroughly and start again. Dogs are clean, and they don’t want to sit in their own mess.\nFirst step: patience.\nHow to transition your puppy out of the crate\nMost people don’t want their puppy to stay in their crate forever. “For me, crate-training is just to help with toilet training and damage limitation. It creates an area where they can sleep without the risk of chewing anything you don’t want them to,” Kasperowicz says. Some people do want their dogs to stay crate-trained. But if you don’t, Kasperowicz says you can transition to a bed on the floor when they are potty trained and no longer teething. “You can start with leaving the door open overnight and allowing access to a nice, comfy bed. After a few weeks of doing this, remove the crate and place the bed where the crate was.”\nBottom line\nCrate-training your puppy can be a great way to potty-train them and keep them under control when they’re going through the most challenging phases of development.\nCrate-training your puppy can be a great way to potty-train them and keep them under control when they’re going through the most challenging phases of development.\nIf you choose to keep them crate-trained into adulthood, it can help ease any fears you may have about leaving them unaccompanied.\nIf you choose to keep them crate-trained into adulthood, it can help ease any fears you may have about leaving them unaccompanied.\nIf you are having difficulties getting your puppy crate-trained, just start from the basics and be patient.\nIf you are having difficulties getting your puppy crate-trained, just start from the basics and be patient.\nFAQs\nThere are no hard and fast rules on how long you can leave a puppy in a crate. However, the younger they are, the more energy they will have, and the more likely they are to have an accident. So you shouldn’t leave a young puppy in their crate for more than a few hours.\nThere’s no magic trick when it comes to crate-training a puppy. Just follow the steps, and they’ll soon pick it up. But you cannot force it.\nIf your dog is crying and whining in the crate, they probably aren’t feeling very comfortable or secure in there. Kasperowicz says that you should never leave your dog in a crate when they are distressed, howling, or barking.\nIf your dog is whining in their crate, they don’t yet feel safe or comfortable in there. You should let them out and revisit crate-training when they are calm, rebuilding those positive associations.",

  },
  "page_content": "In an ideal world, dog walks are a pleasant way to unwind — for you and your pup. You see some sights, they smell some smells, and everyone comes home happy. But where should you walk a reactive dog who flinches at the mere sight of a stroller, barks at strangers, or cowers in the face of cars?\nLife with ajumpy dogis no less rewarding, but these harried hounds have different needs than their more easygoing counterparts. As pet parents, we owe it to them to make their walks feel as safe and rewarding as possible, and that starts with the location.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nWhat do you say, do you wanna go outside? We asked certified behavioristMelissa Simpson, owner and head trainer atHappy Tails Dog Training LLCin Grand Rapids, Michigan, andStephanie Barger, dog trainer and owner ofCanine Zen, which offers remote dog training throughout the United States, to help us scout out the best places to give reactive dogs some fresh air.\n“Walking and/or exercising reactive dogs can be challenging,” Simpson says. “Step one is understanding what triggers your dog’s reactivity: people, other dogs, loud noises, sudden movements, or a combination of things. Step two is choosing situations to set your dog up for a low stress walk.”\nIf your pup acts diabolical on walks, you are not alone. Here’s what you can do.\nWhere should you walk a reactive dog?\nEvery dog is going to have their own preferences. Some dogs are fine around people but terrified of other dogs. Some can’t stand loud noises. Others freak out aroundcrowds of kids. Before you start scoping out locations, make a list of your dog’s biggest triggers so that you know what to avoid.\nPer Simpson,triggers may includebut are not limited to other dogs, unfamiliar people, prey animals (like squirrels), birds, and cats, and movement from vehicles or pedestrians.\n“No single example will work for every dog,” Barger says. “The key is to determine what triggers your dog's unwanted behavior and pick places where you are less likely to encounter them.”\nOnce you’ve made a list of triggers and brainstormed promising places accordingly, scout them first without your dog to get the lay of the land. Once you’ve found a good spot, bring your dog (plus lots of treats) and take things slowly. Here are some suggestions for places you can go:\nFor dogs who are afraid of vehicles and city sounds, a park could be an ideal place for a walk. Still, not all parks are created equal. Simpson recommends looking for spaces that feature “clear and open lines of sight during low activity times of the day, with plenty of space to step off the walking path and provide your dog the opportunity to focus on you and/or search for treats on the ground while distractions pass.”\nWhenever you’re outside with your dog, make sure that your contact information is up to date on both their microchip and their tags. Even if your dog is chipped, it’s crucial that they wear ID because not everyone who finds a lost dog will know to have their microchip checked.\nIf you want to make sure you and your dog will have room to yourselves,consider using Sniffspottorent a private outdoor spacefor your dog to run around and train. Simpson also recommends checking with locally owned pet-friendly shops and privately owned dog parks. “Many are offering times you can sign up to bring your dog shopping or to the park when it is just you and your dog for a specified period,” she says.\nMuch like a clear park, a wide, barrier-free field will allow your dog to see what’s coming in all directions while playing and exercising, Simpson says. For dogs that get anxious when they can’t gauge all possible threats, this could provide a feeling of extra security.\nIf you happen to have an outdoor space of your own, and especially one that’s fenced, why not help your dog take advantage of it by turning it into a doggie theme park? Simpson suggests setting upfind-it gamesand obstacle courses, playing hide and seek, and teaching your dog new tricks.\nEvery pup can benefit from a little retail therapy—and you deserve to feel at ease, too.\nHow do you plan for walks with a reactive dog?\nThis will depend on your dog’s specific triggers. For most dogs, however, consider planning your outing for a quiet, low-traffic hour when triggers will be less frequent.\nSimpson recommends checking out the location before you go to ensure it’ll provide a positive experience. “Whether your dog is overly excited, nervous, or fearful, the fewer stimuli, the easier it is for your dog to enjoy the time outside if there are less distractions,” she says.\nSimpson also recommends bringing along a few positive reinforcements like treats and treasured toys. Finally, she says, make sure that you yourself bring a positive attitude and are ready to support your dog as they explore a new place.\nWhere should you not walk a reactive dog?\nJust like every reactive dog’s preferred walking places will vary, so, too, will the list of spots to avoid. That said, there are some common factors to consider.\n“Usually, very loud and busy locations are difficult for dogs,” Barger says. “However, any place where your dog's triggers are present will put your dog on edge and you will want to avoid them unless you are working a behavior modification program to help them feel better about their triggers.”\nSimilarly, Simpson suggests avoiding high-traffic areas like city sidewalks and parks, pet stores, dog parks, bus stops, playgrounds, crowded parks and trails, or fairgrounds. As tempting as dog-friendly restaurants and bars might be, they’relikely not a great place for a reactive pooch, either. Same goes for gatherings with lots of unfamiliar people — even at your own home.\nUltimately, our experts’ general advice is the same: stay away from anywhere your dog exhibits discomfort.\nTurns out, even experts have a hard time defining these terms.\nWhat are signs that your dog is scared on a walk?\nAny time you’re out with your dog, it’s crucial to monitor their behavior and body language to make sure they’re feeling secure and content. If you notice subtle or overt signs of stress, it might be time to call it a day and gently guide your dog home.\n“Your dog can display signs of discomfort before they overreact which gives you a chance to change the situation so that you don't get the unwanted behavior,” Barger says.\nSome signs of anxiety will be obvious: pulling on the leash, lunging, barking, growling, snarling, shaking, cowering, et cetera. Others will be quieter. Watch how your dog holds their ears, tail, and head, their mouth movements and breathing patterns, and their relative body tension or relaxation.\nAccording to Simpson, some signs of discomfort could include yawning when not tired, head dipping, turning the head away, squinty eyes, large pupils, changes in tail position, mouth open versus closed, ears forward versus back, and quick flicks of the tongue.“If you are concerned your dog may be fearful on a walk, it may help to have someone video your dog’s body language so you can watch it after your walk to look for these more subtle changes in your dog,” Simpson says. From there, you can “assess what was happening around your dog at the time, and that will provide a start as to what your dog is fearful about on your walks.”\nWhatever you do, Simpson says, if your dog is showing signs of reactivity, it’s worth considering professional help.\n“Dogs do not ‘outgrow’ these behavior issues,” she says. “While not every reactive dog will learn to enjoy a dog park or dog friendly restaurant, a good behavior trainer will help you and your dog learn the best possible way to keep your dog happy and in a good emotional state.”",

What gives? Dogs may scratch the carpet for a variety of reasons, ranging from natural instincts to behavioral issues. Understanding the cause of your dog’s carpet-scratching is crucial for addressing the behavior and finding effective solutions.\nThere are a number of reasons why your dog may be scratching the carpet. It‘s important to get to the root of it in order to best address the problem and help your dog find more constructive outlets for their needs. Some of the common reasons why dogs may scratch include instinctive behaviors, anxiety, boredom, or health problems.

Keen observation of how your dog is scratching, when the scratching is most intense, and other related changes in their behavior or health can help you narrow down what is motivating your dog’s desire to scratch. This includes:\nScratching and digging are normal dog behaviors in many instances. These are behaviors passed down through their wolf ancestry and may have had an origin in survival strategy orsocial interactionswith other wolves. For example, wolves and wild dogs will instinctively bury their food, including treats, to hide them from other competing animals. Dogs may scratch the ground or dig in an attempt to cover up a valuable treat, snack, or toy too. Other times, they may scratch or dig as a form of marking.\nBoth wolves and dogs have scent glands on their paws, and they may use these as a way to communicate with other animals. Some dogs will also scratch or dig right after they urinate or defecate, and this is believed to be an additional way that theymark to communicate. Finally, digging is an instinctual behavior that is very useful in the wild. It allows animals to reach prey that may be deep in a burrow, and it also allows them to create a safe den deep in the ground that will be cool and protected. Dogs who do not have access to outdoor areas to dig may substitute actual digging for scratching on the floor, carpet, or even your bed.\nWhen dogs are scared, stressed, or experiencing anxiety, they may also scratch or attempt to dig repetitively. This may be their attempt to escape a scary situation or come find you if they arestressed by your departure. Other times, anxiety may also result in repetitive, compulsive behavior that is not necessarily driven by a rational plan or desire. Some dogs will scratch obsessively in this case, too.\nCompulsive, repetitive behaviors can also be asign of boredomand a lack of mental and physical stimulation. Dogs may scratch as a result of boredom, and pet parents may accidentally reinforce the behavior by giving their dog attention when they do this.\nDogs who are itchymay rub their face or butts on the floors or furniture in an attempt to soothe their itch. There are many reasons for dogs to be itchy and some of the most common ones include allergies, dry skin, fleas, oranal gland problems.\nDog trainer Emma Bowdrey helps explain this common canine behavior.\nSituational carpet scratching\nNoticing when your dog scratches the carpet and what other behaviors or activities may trigger it can help you home in on the underlying reason. Some specific situations when dogs may scratch include:\nThis likely relates back to the instinct to scratch after urinating or defecating. Dogs and wolves are thought to do this as an additional way of marking, or communicating with others. Some dogs will scratch outside right around the area where they eliminated, but other dogs may do this when they come inside.\nScratching at night may have a few different explanations. Some dogs like to scratch before they lay down for the night. This is likely influenced by their instinct tocreate a nest-like denfor sleep. Some dogs also dig before they lay down to reach the cooler layers of the dirt if they are hot, so dogs living indoors may scratch in an attempt to seek out a cooler surface. Other times, this can be more of a compulsive behavior related to boredom, or other behavioral conditions, includingcognitive dysfunctionin older animals.\nFor many dogs, storms can be a source of fear and anxiety. Thesound of thunderis often triggering for many dogs and with their excellent hearing, they can hear the thunder far off in the distance long before we can. Signs of anxiety in dogs with storm phobias can vary. Some dogs slink off and hide, others may pace or whine, and some will scratch or perform other repetitive behaviors.\nDogs have no shame about scratching their butts on your floor, furniture, or fancy new rug. This one is usually caused by itchiness. Sometimes it’s as simple,and gross, as a little poop stuck on their fur or around their butt that they’re trying to remove. Other times, the itch may be related to skin irritation, allergies, or anal gland problems.\nA veton what to do when “anal sacs go bad.”\nHow to stop your dog from scratching the carpet\nThe general concept ofpositive reinforcementis to reward the behaviors you do want and to ignore behaviors you want to stop. If your dog’s scratching is destructive, it may be difficult to ignore. However, if you stop what you’re doing every time your dog starts scratching and give them attention, even if it's notfunattention, you may be unintentionally reinforcing their behavior. Instead, try to work on teaching your dog cues for the types of behaviors you do want to see, liketraining them to go to their mator crate, and then reward them for doing so. If you catch them mid-scratch, try redirecting them to a better activity.\nOffer your dog an approved activity to redirect them from a behavior you don’t want. This may include using a cue to get them to go their designated place in your home, or offering them a toy or other activity to distract them from scratching.\nThis is important for all dogs, and is especially important for dogs who may be scratching due to boredom or anxiety. Dogs need lots of exercise andmental enrichmentevery day to give them healthy outlets for their energy. In addition to daily walks to pee and poop, be sure your dog has opportunities to run, socialize with other dogs, and explore new routes in ways that are safe and appropriate for their specific health and behavioral needs. All dogs also need mental enrichment in addition to exercise. You can use food puzzles, training sessions,agility courses, and evenscent gamesto challenge your pup.\nWhen to seek professional help: If your dog’s scratching seems compulsive, they seem severelyfearful or anxious, or you suspect there is an underlying medical problem, it is important to seek professional help. These kinds of behavioral and medical problems will require more in-depth behavior modification or medications to help your dog get relief and feel their best. Occasional scratching when your dog can be easily redirected is not a cause for concern.\nWhat’s behind the desire and whether it’s safe to do.\nFAQs\nYes, scratching can be a sign of anxiety, especially if it is repetitive and difficult to redirect your dog to other activities, and if you notice other signs of anxiety. There are many ways tohelp an anxious dogfind relief in more constructive ways.\nSome dogs burrowand dig in the bed, due to their instinct to form a den or nest like their wild ancestors. This can be a safe, quiet space for them to sleep.\nReferences\nBekoff M. “Ground scratching by male domestic dogs: a composite signal.” J.

  "page_content": "Does yourdog get distressedwhen you leave them alone? Do they cry or shake or act out in destructive orself-harming ways? Do they start engaging in these behaviors before you even approach the door? Like when you are brushing your teeth, putting on your shoes, turning off the TV, or rummaging in your bag?\nDogs are extremely observant creatures and their favorite thing to observe is you. Makes sense given that you control every aspect of their lives — from when they eat to when they go outside and for how long. In the course of their observations, they may come to notice that you engage in certain behaviors before you leave the house. These behaviors become what are known as pre-departure cues, or PDQs. And if your dog experiences separation anxiety or distress, they may act out whenever you engage in these behaviors, whether you actually separate from them or not.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nAlmost anything can be a PDQ if it is repeatedly performed leading up to your departure. “Routine gestures, like organizing items or gathering things to take with you, can hint to a dog that you’re preparing to leave,” says Qiai Chong, chief behaviorist atPet Coach SG. “Dogs notice PDQs because they are fully present in the moment. And this heightened awareness allows them to pick up on specific activities — including those we may perform subconsciously — and associate them with our departure.”\nPDQs only become a problem when they cause stress behavior — salivating, panting, pacing, crying, barking, shivering, etc. These behaviors might seem minor when you first observe them, but think of your dog like a wind-up toy, and the longer they engage in these stress behaviors before you leave, the more wound up they get. Then, when you’re finally gone, their wind-up key is released and they explode that anxiety all over your house by barking non-stop or tearing up the sofa.\nIf your dog has one PDQ, they’ll get wound up a little, but since you likely engage in multiple pre-departure behaviors your dog may have five or even 10. Each PDQ adds to their anxiety and makes the actual act of you leaving all the more distressing. ”Some dogs may go to great lengths to escape these feelings,” Chong says. “Sometimes, resulting in self-harming behaviors, like chewing on doors or even attempting to jump through windows.”\nHow to get PDQs under control\nFirst, you need to figure out exactly what your dog’s PDQs are. Jessica Jacobson, a dog behavior expert and certified dog trainer atDapper Dog Trainingin New York City, suggests making a list of all the things you do before leaving the house. Then you want to go through this list and see which ones actually elicit a response in your dog. “Be sure to test them separately, not in sequence,” Jacobson says. “Otherwise, you won’t know which individual actions actually trigger your dog.”\nKeep in mind that tasks may need to be broken down into smaller component parts in order for you to figure out exactly where and when your dog is being triggered and help them through it. For instance, putting on your shoes might seem like a simple task, but it actually involves a number of smaller steps: sitting down, reaching for your shoes, actually touching your shoes, putting your feet inside your shoes, lacing your shoes up, etc. And any one of these steps could be the one that triggers your dog. In order to know for sure, you need to watch your dog at every step of this process. When you notice them reacting to what you’re doing, stop. Give them time to recover, then reset and repeat the action up to that specific point until they no longer react.\n“To be effective, this action needs to be repeated multiple times during the day,” Jacobson adds. “If done correctly, your dog should become desensitized to this portion of the action within a couple of days, then you can continue to move forward with the action until you get to another point of reactivity.”\n“Repeating these actions without leaving will gradually help your dog disconnect these cues from your departure,” says Divij Gupta, a canine behaviorist and trainer atSploot. “Over time, they will feel less anxious when you truly need to go, as these cues will no longer trigger immediate stress.”\nOnce you manage to fully desensitize one action on your list, you can move on to another and another, until you’ve worked your way through all your dog’s PDQs. You will need to revisit each trigger from time to time, though, incorporating it into your daily routine with your dog at random intervals to make sure they do not become resensitized.\nAddressing your dog’s separation anxiety\nThe reason PDQs have power over your dog in the first place is because your dog has negative feelings about being left alone. So if you really want to help your dog, you have to address these feelings head on.\nFortunately, you can train your dog to be alone the same way you desensitize them to their PDQs. Chong suggests walking toward the door, then returning to your dog. If your dog doesn’t react, try putting your hand on the doorknob, turning the doorknob, opening the door, etc. At any point, if your dog begins to react, stop, allow your dog to calm down, then reset and try again. Eventually, you should get to the point where you can step outside, then close the door behind you. Stay on the other side for 10 seconds, then 20, then 30. You want to make sure that you return before your dog starts reacting. If you are gone for too long and your dog gets upset, you may have to go back a step or two to regain your progress.\nUnderstand that you may only get five minutes of focus out of them before the process itself becomes stressful. This is not a process you can rush. So, instead of dedicating half an hour to this training once a day, do three to five minutes of training three or four times a day.\n“Once your dog can comfortably manage alone time for approximately 30 minutes, you can begin to re-introduce one PDQ at a time,” Chong says. “It’s normal for there to be some regression in duration during this phase, as the intensity of the perceived separation increases. The key is to introduce each PDQ slowly, allowing your dog to adjust, and then gradually build back their alone time.”\nWhatnotto do\nDealing with PDQs and separation issues can be extremely frustrating, but do your best to remain calm, even if your dog does something upsetting like chewing on your shoes or ripping a hole in the couch. “Punishment can intensify the aversive emotions your dog is already experiencing,” Chong says. “Instead of helping, it can lead to increased anxiety and fear, making the situation worse.”\nDon’t just put them in a crate, either. “While crate training can help dogs feel secure in a confined space, the goal here is to help your dog feel comfortable being left alone, not just in a crate,” Chong says. “These are two different processes and trying to accomplish too much at once can set your dog up for failure and increase their anxiety.”\n“Don’t make a big fuss when leaving or returning home,” Gupta adds. “That could also end up heightening your dog’s anxiety.” Remember that the goal of this training is to calm your dog when you are preparing to leave them. This may require that you allow yourself more time in the morning so you can slow down a little and leave peacefully instead of rushing around in a last-minute tornado of your own anxiety, which will only rile your dog up, too.\nJacobson also suggests that you not take your dog for a walk or cuddle them right before you leave. That might seem counterintuitive, but walks and affection can be very stimulating for a dog and if you leave them alone right after you’ve gotten them excited, you could be supercharging their anxiety. Better to wait a bit until they have calmed down before you head out.\n“Don’t give them food before leaving either,” Chong says. “While some people may think counterconditioning through treats can help,research showsthat this approach is not actually effective for separation-related behaviors. In fact, giving your dog food right before you leave can heighten their anticipation of your departure, potentially increasing their anxiety when you go.”\nWhen should you seek professional help?\n“Separation anxiety and PDQs are really complicated issues,” Jacobson says. ”And dealing with them can leave people feeling trapped in their own homes.” If that’s how you’re feeling, seek help immediately. You don’t have to do this alone, and as helpful as the tips above may be, each dog is different and dog trainers and behaviorists are able to observe your dogs in a way you can’t. They can also offer suggestions tailored to your dog that you might never even have thought of.\n“Sometimes, what looks like separation anxiety to a dog parent is actually something completely different,” says Jacobson, who often finds that adjustments to a dog’s environment are enough to alleviate behaviors otherwise attributed to separation. So, don’t assume you can diagnose the problem. And don’t feel bad if you can’t seem to help your dog on your own. Training can be a financial hardship, but it is an investment in your dog’s wellbeing and your relationship that will pay big dividends.",

There can be many reasons for this behavior, such as not being used to other dogs or being territorial, but sometimes, dogs just don’t like other dogs. So how do you introduce dogs when one is reactive? We spoke with Dr. Terri Bright, clinical behaviorist and director of the behavior department at the Angell Animal Medical Center in Boston, to get the low-down.\nBright cautions that a first step before introducing dogs is considering the value added. What is the benefit of introducing these dogs? Oftentimes, dogs who are known to be aggressive toward other dogs should be kept separate; the risk of them hurting another dog — or a human who tries to intervene — is just not worth it.\nIf your dog appears to be morereactive than aggressive(i.e., they seem fearful and uncertain about other dogs, and they do not offensively try to bite or attack them), you may decide that it is worth it to try to introduce them to another dog. Knowing both dogs’ histories, there are steps you can take to work toward a safe, successful meeting.\nDogs are naturally territorial, so the first step toward a successful meeting is making sure neither is on their home turf. “You don’t want to have your dog in the backyard at its gate and then open the gate and throw another dog in there. That’s like throwing somebody in a shark pool,” Bright says.\nFind an open space where both dogs can be distanced from one another, such as a field or park. You may want to choose somewhere that is fenced in if the dogs will be off leash.\nWhen first introducing dogs when one is aggressive, you should have both dogs on leashes for safety, but youshould not approach head-on, with dogs straining at the leash and getting in each other’s faces. Bright recommends parallel walking, with both pet parents walking their dogs in the same direction, staying as far apart as necessary to keep both dogs calm. Incorporate reward-based training by giving the dogs treats when they look at each other.\n“Gradually, as they stay relaxed you can lessen the distance between them, always giving them treats when they look at each other,” Bright says. “If they stay relaxed and their body language stays relaxed, then they can sniff noses for two seconds then you call them back, walk five or six feet apart, let them touch noses again.”\nIf the parallel walking goes well, both dogs appear to be relaxed and eager to interact, and neither dog is showing signs of aggression, you can attempt to advance to off-leash interaction. Bright advises keeping a leash on the reactive dog and allowing them to drag it on the ground, in case you need to quickly gain control of them again.\n“Just let them interact, sniff around, play, whatever, for two or three minutes, then gather them up again,” Bright says. “You’ll have some idea then how things are going to go. What you’ll see is how they react to each other.”\nIf the dogs remain calm and you see signs of positive interaction, you can gradually increase the time they are allowed to interact.\nThe following are things not to do when introducing dogs.\nDo not introduce them head-on:Bright warns that one of the worst things you can do when introducing dogs is introducing them head-on with them staring each other down at the end of their leash. “The face-to-face meeting with two dogs straining on a leash, the dogs are just going to be too aroused,” Bright says.\nDo not introduce them head-on:Bright warns that one of the worst things you can do when introducing dogs is introducing them head-on with them staring each other down at the end of their leash. “The face-to-face meeting with two dogs straining on a leash, the dogs are just going to be too aroused,” Bright says.\nDo not act scared or stressed:Dogs are very attuned to human behavior, and willpick up on itif you are scared or stressed, which can lead them to thinking that the other dog is a threat.\nDo not act scared or stressed:Dogs are very attuned to human behavior, and willpick up on itif you are scared or stressed, which can lead them to thinking that the other dog is a threat.\nDo not meet in one of the dogs’ territories:That dog may become territorial toward the other dog and become aggressive.\nDo not meet in one of the dogs’ territories:That dog may become territorial toward the other dog and become aggressive.\nDo not introduce them in confined spaces:Meeting in a tight space, such as a living room with a lot of furniture, can create additional stress if a dog feels cornered. It can also make it more challenging to separate the dogs if needed.\nDo not introduce them in confined spaces:Meeting in a tight space, such as a living room with a lot of furniture, can create additional stress if a dog feels cornered. It can also make it more challenging to separate the dogs if needed.\nTurns out, even experts have a hard time defining these terms.\nReading and responding to dog body language\nAn essential part of introducing dogs is reading and responding to their body language. Body language is one of the major ways that dogs communicate and tell us they’re happy, relaxed, scared, or stressed. Keep a close eye on your dog and learn their positive andnegative interaction cuesso that you can prevent the interaction from taking a turn for the worse.\nIf you have a reactive dog, you need to be able to recognize body language thatsignals they are scared, stressed, or becoming aggressive. If you can recognize these signs before your dog is lunging and snapping at the other dog, you can remove them before it escalates to a fight. The following are signs that a dog who is stressed, fearful or aggressive may display:\nRaised hackles\nRaised hackles\nBared teeth\nBared teeth\nEars up and forward\nEars up and forward\nStiff posture\nStiff posture\nHard staring\nHard staring\nIf you notice any of these signs, remove your dog from the situation. When you are ready to try again, back up to parallel walking and positive reinforcement for looking at the other dog calmly.\nPositive interactioncues, on the other hand, can serve as a green light that your dog is enjoying the interaction. Bright recommends looking for mirroring behaviors: “What you want to see is what we call reciprocal play, so dogs mirroring each other’s actions. Maybe one dogplay bows, the other dog play bows, and then they run counter clockwise around the yard, and then maybe there’s another play bow and then they run clockwise around the yard. If they wrestle, then they take turns being on top.”\nShe warns that while many people think that a dog rolling on their back and exposing their belly is a sign of submission, it can actually be a signal that they are done playing.\nBehavior correction, Mary Poppins style: Turn a job into a game.\nHow to break dog aggression towards other dogs\nBright cautions against talking about dog behavior in terms of “fixing” a problem.\n“It’s too big a question to say, ‘Can you cure an aggressive dog?’” she says. “It’s just a question of, can you control the environment where the dog is? Can you teach alternative behaviors that are reliable enough so you keep the dog from aggressing in the future?”\nThe following are some strategies for managing a dog who is aggressive toward other dogs.\nReward-based training is a positive-training method that involves giving dogs treats or praise when they exhibit the behaviors you want them to do. This conditions dogs over time to associate good vibes (i.e., treats) with listening to you, staying calm and relaxed, and exhibiting other positive behaviors.\nUse reward-based training to teach your dog appropriate behaviors around other dogs. This can include giving them treats when they look toward the other dog without barking or lunging or when they sit quietly by your side in the presence of another dog.\nKinship always promotesreward-based trainingover punishment or fear-based training.\nInteractions between two dogs, when one is aggressive or reactive, should remain supervised and structured. This allows pet parents to maintain control over the situation, compared to unsupervised, off-leash playtime, which can quickly escalate to not-so-playful when one dog is aggressive.\nActivities like parallel walks, or time-limited play sessions can allow parents to continue assessing the situation for signs that their dog is reaching their limit and no longer enjoying the interaction.\nAs with any training regime, it will taketime and patiencefor two dogs to get used to one another. In early interactions, start with small increments. During a parallel walk, let dogs sniff each other for a few seconds before retreating. If you’ve deemed it safe for them to interact off-leash, start with just a few minutes of playing before calling them apart.\nItispowerful enough, even for the tough cases, and itisthe best choice—here’s why.\nHousehold management for multiple dogs\nOftentimes, forced proximity of two dogs who don’t get along happens during the holidays or other gatherings when it is normal for people to bring their pets. To keep these multiple-pet visits calm and controlled, pet parents need to take a few steps, including establishing separate spaces and supervising interactions.\nBecausedogs can be territorial, shared toys, food and water bowls, and living spaces can start a fight. Designate a room for each dog where they will sleep, eat and drink, and be left alone. This can prevent any territory-driven aggression from occurring.\nWhen two dogs are sharing a household and one is aggressive, it is essential that pet parents supervise interactions so they can separate the dogs if necessary. To keep both dogs safe, you should only allow the dogs to interact in controlled environments when both dogs can remain calm. If that means they can only interact during parallel walks, so be it. If that means they can only play outside and not inside, so be it. You know your dog and their triggers best, so you can set them up for success by controlling their environment.\nWhen one of the dogs is aggressive, it is very likely that the two dogs will never be able to peacefully occupy the same general spaces, and that is OK. Part of being a pet parent is knowing your dog’s limits and behaviors so you can keep them and others safe.\n“You want to make sure that each dog can be successfully segregated in a room by itself, and then you basically rotate the dogs out: OK, it’s Fluffy’s turn. OK, it’s Max’s turn,” Bright says. “If that is not possible … because the dog screams and cries if it’s separated, then maybe one dog needs to be kenneled and doesn’t go for Thanksgiving.”\nI can vouch that the rotation is a great solution for household management for multiple dogs. While I would love for my corgi and my brother-in-law’s Australian Shepherd to get along, we’ve had too many scuffles to allow them to interact. It is a lot more peaceful for the whole family when one dog is in the common area while the other has alone time behind a closed door. Every few hours, we rotate the dogs so that they get equal attention from the humans. It’s not ideal, but it’s much better than constantly fearing a dog fight.\nTrainer Charlie DiBono warns against these greetings on all fronts.\nFAQs:\nWhile similar, there is a difference between reactivity and aggression in dogs. Aggression is behavior with the intent to harm, and reactivity is a strong reaction to an external stimulus. For example, a dog who lunges and barks at other dogs and would bite them if unleashed is exhibiting aggression. A dog who has an excessive or intense reaction to a specific stimulus, such as a dog walking by or a person ringing a doorbell — but does not actively try to cause harm — is exhibiting reactive behavior.\nOne less-than-ideal behavior that dogs may exhibit during an interaction is humping. If one of the dogs is irritated and you need tostop the humping, strategies like redirecting the dog’s attention or leading them away with a leash may be effective.\nReferences:\nDay, Jasey. “Reading Dog Body Language to Socialize Your Dog.”Understanding Dog Body Language When Introducing New Furry Friends Helps with Socialization.

  "page_content": "Training a puppy to pee outside requires consistency, patience, and positive reinforcement to establish good habits early on. You can effectively train your pup by creating a regular schedule, closely monitoring their behavior, and rewarding successful outdoor bathroom trips.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nHow to train your puppy to pee outside\nWhen training a puppy, it’s helpful touse positive reinforcement. Positive reinforcement allows you to reward your dog for doing the correct behavior over and over. When using positive reinforcement, you are rewarding your dog before they have the chance to do something wrong. This helps you establish a great routine with your dog. The more they do the correct thing and are rewarded, the more this behavior will become a habit and will help avoid behaviors you do not want.\nReward your pup as soon as they pee or poop. You will want to use a yummy treat. If your puppy is prone to accidents, it may be a good idea to get a high-value treat to use only during potty training. Puppies are easily distracted, so remember to wait until they are done going to crinkle the treat bag to reward them.\nAn accident is just that, an accident your puppy is learning all about the world and is learning what is right and wrong. When you scold your dog for having an accident, you are only teaching them not use the bathroom in front of you. Since a puppy doesn't understand human language if you yell or get upset with your puppy they don’t understand ‘no don't pee here’. They are only learning that you got mad that they peed not that you are mad about where they had the accident. This may cause your puppy to continue to have accidents and instead begin to hide them from you.\nEstablishing a routine is the best way to avoid accidents. When potty training you should always take your puppy outside right away after eating, playing, or waking from a nap. If you live in an apartment or have a long walk to get outside, it may be best to pick up your pup on the way out. This will help prevent an accident if your puppy can’t hold it en route.  A timer is your best friend when potty training. As soon as your puppy goes, restart your timer again.\nTeaching your puppy to ring a bell when they need to pee or poop is a great way to help dogs communicate the need to go outside. Choosing the correct bell that a dog can ring is important. Your dog will either nudge the bell with their nose or swat the bell with their paw. So, keep that in mind when choosing the bell to buy and where to keep it in the house.\nAt first, you will need to teach your puppy to ring the bell separately from using the bathroom. When introducing the bell to your dog, start by ringing the bell right before you open the door to take your puppy out. As you ring the bell each time you take your puppy to the bathroom, you are creating an association with that sound and the door opening for potty time.\nRemember, potty time is not play time, so if your puppy is trying to play, ignore them by standing in one spot, holding the leash. When you beginning training, it’s best to always go to the same spot to let your puppy use the bathroom. This will help you train your dog to go to the bathroom right when they come outside, rather than sniffing and sniffing, looking for the perfect spot to go.\nNow that your puppy is empty, has played a little, and is ready to learn, it’s time to train your puppy to ring the bell.\nStart by allowing them to examine the bell. New things can be scary to a puppy, so let them sniff and engage with it (don’t let them play tug with it). Once you have your puppy engaging with the bell, you can reward them with a treat each time they touch the bell (if you have a more timid dog you may need to start by just rewarding them when they look over at the bell, then move to touch). Once your puppy is willingly touching the bell, you will then stop rewarding for just touching and reward it when they nudge it harder so it makes a sound.\nContinue to reward them for making the bell sound until they are able to do it consistently and that it is loud enough to hear in another room. When your pup is comfortable with ringing the bell you can add it into your potty routine. Remember, if you think your puppy may have an accident, you should continue to ring the bell yourself. Otherwise, you can let your pup ring the bell and immediately take them outside.\nAs you begin to consistently do this, your dog will build an association with ringing the bell and going outside. Over time, your puppy will ring the bell to go outside without your help when this happens, you must take your puppy outside right away, and remember to keep them on the leash. Puppies are very smart, so you want to make sure you are training your puppy to ring the bell only to go to the bathroom not to go outside and play.\nFirst step: patience.\nHow to potty train puppy from a pee pad to outside\nYay —  it’s finally time to move your puppyaway from the pee padand get them to go outside, but how do you do this? Some puppies may be easy. You may be able to take them right outside after they eat, play, or wake from a nap. If you do this, they will go because you have created a routine with these behaviors. But some puppies may have a harder time; there can be a lot of new distractions outside.\nIf they have trouble, you can take a used pee pad outside to start. Place it on the floor by a tree or in an area you think looks inviting for a puppy to go to the bathroom place it there and wait (with your puppy on the leash). Allow your puppy to sniff the area and when they use the bathroom reward them. Remember to be consistent, and use the same area to go to the bathroom throughout the duration of training your puppy.\nContinue to do this a few times. Then, you can use a clean pee pad. Once your puppy is going consistently with the non-soiled pad, try and have them go with no pee pad at all. Remember to give your puppy a few minutes to figure it out before giving up. Puppies take time to generalize skills. Each time you add a new piece to the puzzle (or take it away in this case) it is like a new skill to your puppy.\nIf anything requires patience, it’s this.\nPuppy potty training schedule\nHere is a sample schedule to follow as you begin your potty training journey with your puppy. These are just general guidelines; always adjust your puppy’s schedule to meet their needs. Also, the size of your puppy may affect how often they need to go out. The amount of food or water your puppy has consumed may affect the frequency needed for bathroom breaks. Has your puppy just: woken up, played, eaten? Go right outside.\nFollow this if your puppy is out and about during free time, after they have played, eaten, or slept.\nNew to potty training or two to three months old: Take them out 30 minutes; maximum hold time: one hour\nNew to potty training or two to three months old: Take them out 30 minutes; maximum hold time: one hour\nThree to four months old: Take them out 45 minutes to one hour; maximum hold time: two hours\nThree to four months old: Take them out 45 minutes to one hour; maximum hold time: two hours\nFour to five months: Take them out every two hours; maximum hold time: three to four hours\nFour to five months: Take them out every two hours; maximum hold time: three to four hours\nFive to six months: Take them out every three hours; maximum hold time: five to six hours\nFive to six months: Take them out every three hours; maximum hold time: five to six hours\nFollow these guidelines when your puppy is home alone and crated. They should be able to hold their pee for as many hours as the number of months old they are, plus one. (Remember these are just guidelines. Each puppy is different.)\ntwo months: three hours\ntwo months: three hours\nthree months: four hours\nthree months: four hours\nfour months: five hours\nfour months: five hours\nfive months: six hours\nfive months: six hours\nsix months: seven hours\nsix months: seven hours\nTips you’ll want to pay attention to.\nHow to train a stubborn puppy to pee outside\nSome puppies are harder to train than others. The size and breed of your dog can affect how easy or hard they may be to potty train. If you find your puppy is hard to potty train, take a look at your schedule. Are you sticking to it consistently? If you aren’t, then you may need to shorten the time between potty breaks. Are there any new or added stressors or anxiety for your puppy? This can be a cause of accidents.\nAs always, be sure that the entire family is on board with the potty training rules and schedules, it must be followed by everyone who is home with the puppy. Always go to the same area that way your dog can smell their urine from last time, and it will remind them of what they need to do outside. Have a treat party after they go: Give them a few treats, and use a lot of praise and petting.\nTypically, if you are taking your puppy outside only for them to come back inside and pee, they are not properly potty trained yet. Always go to the same place when taking your puppy outside do not take them on a walk to use the bathroom just stand in one area and allow them to sniff in a circle around you. This will create consistency. Once your puppy goes to the bathroom reward them with a few treats and a lot of praise.\nCould something outside be scaring your puppy or giving them anxiety? This may prevent them from using the bathroom in a certain area. Keep an eye on their behavior when they are outside. Do they look stiff, crouch down, have their ears perked up, or are they quickly looking from spot to spot? There may be something outside that is causing them to be afraid, which may prevent them from going.\nPotty training regression can happen. Change in your puppy’s environment or routine can be a cause for a potty training regression. If your puppy starts a new food or something upsets their stomach they may have unusual accidents. Sometimes, construction outside or extra noise can lead to anxiety, which can also cause regression.\nGo back a few steps in your training to help your puppy be successful. Shorten the time between potty breaks and go back to rewarding your puppy if you have stopped.\nAccidents are going to happen during potty training, it is not a perfect science, even with all of the consistency and treats. When an accident happens, stay calm. If you just found the accident on the floor do not bring it to your dog’s attention, just quietly clean it up.\nYou can not scold a dog for something they did in the past. If you catch your puppy mid-accident, calmly say, “Oops,” and redirect them to outside as fast as you can. When they finish going potty in the correct area, be sure to heavily reward them. Only give your puppy free time in the house when you know they are “empty.” This will help prevent accidents and give you more control when it comes to successful pee breaks outside.\nWhen cleaning up an accident, use an enzymatic cleaning product and try your best to get everything. Do not use a cleaner that is ammonia-based; urine has ammonia in it. If you are use a cleaner with ammonia the area will still smell like urine and your dog may continue to pee in that area.\nTraining your puppy to pee outside when it’s cold or snowing is the same as training them to go outside when it is not. Depending on your dog’s breed and temperament, they may adjust to the colder weather easier than others. If your dog is affected by the cold,try a jacket. If you have a very small short-hair breed, and it’s extremely cold, you may need to enlist the help of pee pads until it gets a bit warmer. Your vet will be able to help you decide if it would be best to keep your small puppy inside for a bit during the colder months.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nAll puppies are different, and it’s hard to give an exact timeline of when a specific puppy will be potty trained. Your consistency also plays a huge factor in how fast it takes for your puppy to get potty trained. With consistent training, it can take between four to six months for your puppy to be potty trained, but some puppies may take a year.\nPlace your puppy on a pee pad after they have eaten, played, or just woke up, this will make it easy for you to catch your puppy in the act. Reward them for using the bathroom on the pee pad. After your puppy has used the bathroom start your timer, when it goes off place your puppy on the mat. It may be helpful to use a leash to assist with keeping them on the mat while you wait for them to go.\nPuppies can generallyhold their peefor the number of months they are old plus one. So, a four month old puppy can typically hold his pee for about five hours. This timeline does not include when your puppy has just woken up, played or eaten. You should always take a puppy right out to the bathroom after those three activities.\nYes, it’s important to learn your puppies “tells” when potty training. Look out for what your puppy does right before peeing. This will help you learn when they are just about ready to go so you can better have a handle on when they need to go out. They may walk around in a circle, start barking, become restless, or start sniffing around.",

Here’s our insider/trainer’s eye view to help take the mystery out of your search and make sure you and your dog have a safe, positive experience.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nThis first part isunfortunate but true: There are zero regulations in the dog-training industry. That means anyone and their neighbor can say they’re a dog trainer with no professional experience or education and charge money to train dogs. This not only leads to serious harm to dogs with dangerous and outdated methods, but wasting your valuable time and money with ineffective training. All the more reason to ask all the right questions and know the red flags to look out for.\nWhat’s the trainer’s M.O.?\nThe most important thing to find out about a trainer ishowthey will train your dog. Science and experience over the years have made it clear that “positive reinforcement” or “reward-based” training is the most effective and humane way to train dogs. Positive methods focus on the use of rewards, usually food, to make the behavior you want to happen happen and the withholding of rewards to make unwanted behaviors less likely. Your dog will be the happiest student ever.\nYour puppy training schedule, from eight weeks to six months. Let’s do this.\nPositive trainers avoid the use of any negative techniques and tools, such as electronic collars (shock collars), prong collars, choke collars, leash corrections, and other forms of punishment. These methods often only suppress undesirable behaviors and have been proven to cause additional behavior problems, like fearfulness, aggression, and learned helplessness. These are all problems that usually take longer to fix than the initial training issue.\nSome trainers use a mix of rewards and punishment — a key watch-out is for the term “balanced trainer.” Balance is great in every other part of your life except training, where it’s a euphemism for the ambiguity of rewardingandpunishing your dog for behaviors.\nWhat credentials should a trainer have?\nIn an unregulated industry, there are many paths to a quality education as a professional trainer, but  “loves dogs,” “have had dogs all my life,” or “have worked with dogs for 10 years” don’t qualify. While experience is important, dog training and behavior modification is a science. Understanding how dogs learn, how to effect and change behavior humanely, and how to read dog body language are skills that require study. Some respected dog training certifications to look for in your trainer search (list is not exhaustive):\nKPA-CTP\nKPA-CTP\nCTC\nCTC\nCPDT-KA\nCPDT-KA\nCBCC-KA\nCBCC-KA\nCDBC\nCDBC\nVSA-CDT\nVSA-CDT\nEach of these organizations has a search to find one of their certified trainers by location. But certifications aren’t a full-proof guarantee. Just because a trainer has letters after their name, doesn’t mean they uphold the standards of the certifying organization or they will be a good match for you. Do your research, ask questions, and make sure you know what’s going to happen during your training sessions.\nA dog behaviorist schools us on why puppy classes are more about socializing than getting straight As.\nAnd just because a dog trainer has a laundry list of education, doesn’t mean they have experience or are a good teacher. Dog training is often 75 percent training people and 25 percent training dogs, so your person should be able to speak to you just as well as they can speak to your dog.\nQuestions to ask before hiring a trainer:\nWhat method of training do you use?\nWhat method of training do you use?\nWhat is your education? Do you have any certifications/belong to any professional organizations?\nWhat is your education? Do you have any certifications/belong to any professional organizations?\nWhat equipment will you use on/with my dog?\nWhat equipment will you use on/with my dog?\nWhat happens if my dog makes a mistake / gets it wrong?\nWhat happens if my dog makes a mistake / gets it wrong?\nCan you provide references?\nCan you provide references?\nIf any of the answers to these questions leave you feeling uneasy, uncomfortable, or the dog trainer asks you to do things to/with your dog you feel are wrong, don’t hire them. It’s that easy. Just because they’re the “professional” doesn’t mean they’re right for your dog. And take a look around a potential trainer’s social media — sometimes you’ll get a more revealing sense of their vibe, good or bad, than you might from a direct answer.\nRed flags and clues you can use\nNo one is going to say their methods are outdated, dangerous, and unsupported by science, but if you know how to spot the red flags and what’s behind them, you’ll have all the clues you need to know when to steer clear. Here are some widely agreed-upon red flags to identify trainers using old school and harmful methods:\nThey use language like “alpha/dominance/pack leader.” These theories and methods have been long debunked in the current dog training world and don’t meet the standards of science-based training.\nThey use language like “alpha/dominance/pack leader.” These theories and methods have been long debunked in the current dog training world and don’t meet the standards of science-based training.\nThey won’t or don’t use food.\nThey won’t or don’t use food.\nThey focus on punishing behaviors rather than rewarding behaviors.\nThey focus on punishing behaviors rather than rewarding behaviors.\nThey offer guarantees or quick behavior changes.

Their body goes rigid and they stare at the other dog with an intensity that only a dog can muster. It's as if everything around them has melted away and all that exists in the universe is the two of them. Sometimes a word from you is all it takes to break their focus and move them along, but other times, especially when the other dog is staring back, getting your pup to disengage can be a real challenge. And failing to do so can have disastrous consequences.\n“Intense eye contact for dogs is very confrontational and can lead to aggression,” says Annie-Mae Levy, adog trainer at Woofzwith a BS in animal behavior. “That’s why it is so important to have a plan in place, because once your dog fixates, things can escalate quickly — from barking, to lunging, to a full-blown fight.”\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nWhy do dogs fixate on each other?\nDogs fixate on each other for a number of reasons, many of them completely benign. They might want to play or find themselves with a lot of pent-up energy they don’t know what to do with. They could be curious about this other dog, or anticipating a greeting or some other form of interaction.\nYounger dogs might not yet know how to read the body language of other dogs, so they might fixate while trying to figure a new dog out.\n“The breed also plays a role,” says Levy. “Herding or hunting dogs, for example, may ‘lock on’ to things more easily.”\nTwo animal behavior experts agree it’s usuallyplay fighting. Here’s how you can tell.\n“Dogs also fixate when they are getting ready to defend themselves,” says Sally Grotini, a certified trainer of service and therapy dogs and dog behavior expert atJustAnswer. “They may also have a possessive aggressive temperament or be possessive of their human.” It’s also possible they have a naturally fearful temperament, which causes them to fixate more easily. These fear-based fixations are the ones most likely to lead to a fight, because even if your dog isn’t particularly aggressive or possessive, the dog they are fixating on might be. And it only takes one dog to start a fight.\nWhat should you do if you notice your dog fixating?\nFirst and foremost, don’t yank the leash. “Yanking the leash can actually cause the dog to act out faster,” says Grottini. “If a dog is fixed on a fight, yanking on the dog can put them in motion to do so.”\nLevy agrees. “Yanking on the leash might seem like a quick fix, but it can actually make things worse. It can even lead to the dog associating the discomfort they feel at being yanked with the other dog, which could make them even more reactive next time.”\nYanking on your dog’s leash can also hurt your dog’s neck, and saving your dog from getting hurt is the whole point of breaking their fixation in the first place.\nInstead, try blocking your dog’s view of the other dog. This can be as simple as slowly walking in front of your dog and then leading them away, as shown inthis Instagram reel from South End Dog Training. If that doesn’t work, try getting down on the dog’s level and fully blocking their view of the other dog. This should be enough to distract them to the point where you can redirect them away from the object of their fixation. If all else fails, you can use gentle pressure to move them along, but, again, don’t yank them. Use your hands to gently direct them where you want to go.\nGrottini also recommends keeping a favorite toy or high-value treat like chicken slivers in your pocket that you can pull out if your dog doesn’t want to give you their attention.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nAlternately, you may just need to walk your dog in a less crowded area, where there are fewer dogs for them to fixate on.\nCan you train your dog not to fixate in the first place?\nWhile you can’t train fixation behavior out of your dog entirely, you can train them to drop their fixation and return their attention to you.\nLevy recommends starting with a “look at me” command. Teach your dog the command at home, away from other dogs. Once the command is perfected, take them to a location where other dogs are present, but far away, and train the command again. Over time, you can move closer to the other dogs. Reinforce their behavior by rewarding them every time they glance at another dog and then return their attention to you. “It’s like building a habit,” says Levy. “They need to learn that it is rewarding to glance at things and then back at you.”\nGrottini recommends a similar command: “leave it,” which, when properly trained, can be used to get a dog to drop any fixation, whether it is another dog, a person, a car, or a piece of food on the sidewalk. “Many people do not train this command long enough as it should be trained for at least six months and trained with all sorts of items, people, other dogs, cars, etc. Anything you think the dog will encounter; this command should be taught around,” says Grottini.\nWhat if you notice another dog fixating on your dog?\nThere is no predicting or controlling what another person’s dog will do. Try to stop your own dog from staring back — using treats, a clicker, or well-trained commands like the ones discussed above — and then put some distance between both dogs.\n“It’s also important to stay calm and not overreact,” says Levy. “Because your dog is going to take cues from your behavior.”\nAt what point should you seek help from a trainer?\nTraining dogs is hard. Especially when you are trying to train them out of a reactive behavior like fixation. For this reason, both Grottini and Levy recommend seeking professional help sooner, rather than later. “If your dog’s fixations are constant and it’s leading to reactive or aggressive behavior, it’s time to get help from a professional trainer,” says Levy. “They can figure out if your dog is acting out of fear or excitement, or something else, and give you a solid idea on how to manage it.” They can help you practice commands and make sure you have all the tools you need to keep your dog and yourself safe.",

  },
  "page_content": "Howling is an instinctive noise for many dogs to make — a long, sad sound that’s very different from barks, whining, or the little yelps they also make. Many different stimuli may trigger a pup to howl, and one of those can be a siren.\nIf you live in a bigger city where there’s more frequent noise, sirens of all types may just be in the soundscape of your day-to-day life. And while a dog’s howl, of course, can be very cute, it also may distress your pup or also be annoying, depending on how often it occurs. A dog howling at a siren is their own instinct to respond to a high-pitched noise that may remind them of other dogs or wolves. And that response may be a way to communicate to said “other dog” or another way to express anxiety or potential danger.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWhy do dogs howl?\nOne of the main reasons dogs howl is to communicate. Certified animal behaviorist Caroline Wilkinson tells Kinship, “While most dogs will use scent and body language as their primary forms of communication, certain breeds are more likely to use vocalizations to share information — for example, scent hounds and sled dogs,” she says. “Howling might be heard when a dog is trying to gain attention, in response to certain sounds, or to signal distress.”\nSome of that might be responding to stimuli — babies, singing, and the aforementioned sirens all can be potential reasons that a dog might howl. The biggest reason that a dog might howl, though, is if they hear other dogs and want to communicate with them.\nA dog might howl just for attention, if they are bored or lonely. You want to be sure to not reinforce the howling, but it might be a good way to think about other ways to entertain your pet.\nSome of that attention-seeking might be because a dog is trying to communicate what is going on with it. For example, a dog with separation anxiety might howl because they have been left alone. Or if a dog is just bored, they may resort to howling to express that emotion.\nIt’s always a good idea to take a dog howling seriously because in some cases they may be responding to physical pain. Be sure to check to see if there’s anything that could cause your dog to be unwell.\nHow to help a howling dog turn down the volume (or even hit the off button).\nWhy do dogs howl at sirens?\nAccording to Wilkinson, there’s many different reasons why a dog might howl at a siren ranging from protection to being scared.\n“It could be that they’re alerting you to a potential threat or intruder — or even to signal the same alert to other dogs in the area,” she says. “It could be a natural instinctive behavior — while our dogs are domesticated, some primal instincts remain. They might also be scared of the sound, with its undulating nature and the fact it gets louder as it gets closer. It may even be that, at one time, the pitch of the siren caused them to howl, which their guardians then laughed at or encouraged — giving reinforcement for this behavior — so they continue to join in when hearing sirens in the hope of getting the same attention from their humans.”\nWhile a siren to human ears isn’t much more than being an irritation, Wilkinson says sirens sound much different to dogs because of the scope of their hearing. “Dogs can hear much better than us humans — meaning the sirens will sound much louder to them and they’ll hear them earlier than we do. Watch your dog’s body language to see if they seem scared of the sound or are trying to move away from it to muffle the noise.”\nIf a dog’s hearing is better than a human’s, a natural question that comes up is if a siren could potentially hurt dog ears. “It’s unlikely the sirens will impact your dog’s hearing unless they had the sound blasted for a continuous period of time, but for dogs who have noise phobias, it could be very uncomfortable for them emotionally,” Wilkinson notes.\nDogs don’t necessarily outgrow howling, and hearing a siren may just naturally trigger that response in them. If it’s something that becomes unwieldy, a pet parent can look into training that can help curb a dog from howling.\nIs your dog showing empathy? Or just plain annoyance?\nHow to help your dog stop howling at sirens\nWilkinson says that it’s important to first to recognize what is causing your dog to howl and what it might stem from. If you recognize it’s not stemming from pain or anxiety, the positive enforcement route is a good way to go. “If it’s just for fun, then you can teach your dog an alternative behavior like going to pick up a toy whenever they hear a siren — or you could train a positive word such as “thank you” to mean treats are coming from another room, so you can interrupt the behavior and guide your dog away easily from the sound,” Wilkinson recommends.\nAnother way to prevent a dog from howling is to teach them the “quiet” cue. When your dog begins to howl, wait for them to quiet down, and then say “quiet” in a normal tone of voice and offer them a treat. Continue to repeat this command when your dog howls to help curb that behavior.\nWilkinson says that if a dog’s howling seems to stem from anxiety or problems with noises, it may be worth going to a vet to get recommendations for solving the problem. “If your dog is feeling anxious, then speak to your veterinarian to ensure they’re not suffering from any pain — many dogs who have noise phobias are physically uncomfortable,” she says.  “Then, you can work with an ethical canine behaviorist to support your dog’s fears and grow their confidence. If you live in a busy city area where sirens are regularly heard, thick curtains may block out a little noise and playing white noise within your home can add a further buffer to external sounds.”\nIt’s about more than barking.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nDogs howl as a means of communicating with other dogs, responding to other sounds like sirens, or a way to express emotions or anxiety.\nYou can help curb a dog from howling with training by using positive reinforcement and specific cues.\nWilkinson says scent hounds and sled dogs are some of the breeds most likely to howl.\nReferences\nA new perspective on barking in dogs\nA new perspective on barking in dogs\nHow Dogs Think: Understanding the Canine Mind\nHow Dogs Think: Understanding the Canine Mind",

    "title": "7 Myths Harmful to Pit Bulls—Debunked",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/are-pit-bulls-aggressive"
  },
  "page_content": "What people expect when they see a Pit Bull and what they get are two very different things. Thanks to the incredibly harmful stereotypes that have persisted across popular culture and media over several decades, these velvet hippos often get labeled as “scary” or “aggressive,” when nothing could be further from the truth. They’re basically just glorified body pillows, always ready for a big cuddle and angling for nothing more than treats and belly rubs.\nBut because there clearly aren’t enough people who know this about Pitties, it’s time to get the word out. This National Pit Bull Awareness Month, wedecided to put on ourMythBusterscaps (read: stylish berets) on. We consulted some experts to debunk the most common misconceptions about Pit Bulls in hopes that everyone will finally understand just how magical these pups are.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nEverything you need to know about thefivebreeds dubbed “Pit Bulls.”\nMyth #1: Pit Bulls are a purebred breed.\nGiven all the stereotypes and generalizations about their behavior, there’s a bit of irony in the fact that Pit Bulls are not evena purebred breed. Instead, they are more of a breed type with various specific breeds falling under the term’s umbrella. It’s for this reason that Pit Bulls are not recognized by the American Kennel Club. Because of the unofficial nature of this title, classification can be a bit muddy, but generally, Pitties are identified by their muscular builds, blocky heads, and shorter snouts. Of course, classifying a dog by their appearance can create a hell of a lot of issues for how they’re perceived and, crucially, how they’re regulated in certain aspects.\nIt also doesn’t help that these appearances apply to a number of breeds and breed types. But the five purebred breeds that commonly fall under the Pit Bull designation are American Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, American Bulldogs, and American Bullies.This is something that makes their natural behaviors hard to pinpoint or define accurately.\n“If we’re thinking about Pit Bulls as a grouping of specific breeds then each of those breeds has their own general breed-specific tendencies,” explains veterinary behavioristDr. Valli Parthasarathy. She adds that when dealing with gene pools this mixed and varied, over time, some specific breed tendencies or personality traits can be diluted while others may be enhanced. In short, if someone says a Pittie is inherently X or Y, they’re probably full of it. Speaking of…\nHow the Pit Bull advocate is bolstered by her Instagram-famous psychiatric support dog.\nMyth #2: Pit Bulls are inherently vicious.\nAh yes, the subliminal prejudice hiding beneath every backhanded compliment on how“well-behaved”any Pit Bull is. They have long been subjected to decades of negative representation in the media. This ongoing bias has led some to assume they are “fighting dogs” who are naturally aggressive.\nPerASPCA’s statementon Pit Bulls, no dog is born violent. “While a dog’s genetics may predispose it to behave in certain ways, genetics do not exist in a vacuum. Rather, behavior develops through a complex interaction between environment and genetics,” it reads. Dr. Parthasarathy seemingly agrees with this sentiment, adding: “By and large, most Pit Bulls tend to be quite friendly and loving with their people. I don’t think that they are inherently violent dogs.” Again, they love a belly rub.\nMyth #3: Most dog bites come from Pit Bulls.\nIn what is a natural progression from the assumption that Pitties are innately aggressive is the notion that the breed type is responsible for most canine attacks. Naturally, this is nonsense. For starters, there are no official dog-bite statistics tracking breeds and how often they’re involved in bite incidents.\nFor example, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) follows the number of bite incidents and how severe they are but not the breeds involved because the organization believes it isirrelevant to the issue. Additionally, theAmerican Veterinary Medical Associationstates that, “Any dog can bite, regardless of its breed.It is the dog’s individual history, behavior, general size, number of dogs involved, and the vulnerability of the person bitten that determines the likelihood of biting and whether a dog will cause a serious bite injury.”\nBreed-specific legislation has profound impacts on families, their dogs, and animal welfare professionals.\nMyth #4: Pit Bulls have “lockjaw.”\nMaybeit’s not a far leap to go frommostbites toworstbites. And like a lot of sequels, this claim is even bigger and dumber than its predecessor. Many believe that Pitties can possess “lockjaw,” an idea that their mouths will forcefully latch shut if they get their paws on you like the shark inJawsstoically devouring Robert Shaw.\nDr. Parthasarathy debunks this myth pretty directly. “People wonder about whether Pit Bulls have a jaw-locking mechanism, they don’t have a jaw-locking mechanism,” she explains. In fact, German Shepherds, Dobermans, Rottweilers, and Great Danes are all known to have stronger bites than your average American Pit Bull Terrier.\nMyth #5: They can’t hang with kids or other pets.\nAnother fear associated with the breed type’s perceived aggression is that they should not be trusted around children. But history tells another story entirely. In fact, Pitties are so gentle and sweet to their humans that they make excellentservice dogs.\nSimilarly, people tend to think these dogs don’t get along with other animals, either. While Dr. Parthasarathy says, once again, that a dog’s behavior is a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors, there is one organization that has tried to quantify breed activity. TheAmerican Temperament Test Societyranked dog temperament by a series of tests that look at how specific breeds react to various stimuli.\nIt notes that the American Staffordshire Terrier and the American Pit Bull Terrier both earned high marks for affability and were among the most well-tempered dogs overall. Not to point fingers, but each was found less likely to show aggression than Golden Retrievers, Border Collies, Poodles, and countless other breeds.\n“Comedy and entertainment — that’s my passion. But my purpose in life is saving dogs. And somehow I have managed to combine the two.”\nMyth #6: Breed-specific legislation decreases attacks.\nNot only doesbreed-specific legislation(BSL) not minimize dog attacks, it actively makes situations worse. Dr. Parthasarathy warns that BSL can create problems by manufacturing anxieties for pet parents that would not be there otherwise. “It’s been shown that generally breed-specific bans are not helpful in reducing dog bites,”  she explains. “Bans like this make many people proactively afraid of them. It also makes people caring for these dogs more afraid that their dog will be blamed if a dog fight occurs — even if they didn’t start it.” Similar to the number of attacks, BSL is largely influenced by media representation making its implementation immensely subjective.\nThis is before noting how BSL disproportionately impacts Pitties and is often used specifically to target them. But don’t take our clearly aggravated word for it. Here’s what former President Barack Obama had to say on the subjectin a statement10 years ago. “We don’t support breed-specific legislation — research shows that bans on certain types of dogs are largely ineffective and often a waste of public resources … And the simple fact is that dogs of any breed can become dangerous when they’re intentionally or unintentionally raised to be aggressive,” he said.\nLoyal, devoted, and dutiful, Pit Bulls are proving to be pretty well suited to helping humans in need.\nMyth #7: Pit Bulls are difficult to train.\nThe truth is that Pitties are known to be smart pups and amongthe easiest to train.\nDr. Parthasarathy confirms this, pointing to many challenges that are environmental in origin rather than instinctual: “Pit Bulls are very teachable. The key is finding what motivates them positively and addressing any underlying physical or emotional conditions that may hinder their ability to learn, such as fear, anxiety, or difficulty controlling impulsivity.” She adds that they alsodon’tneed a “firm hand” to learn. Pit Bulls are trainable like any other type of dog — withpositive reinforcement.\nIf any of this seems too nitpicky, there’s good reason to debunk these myths. Not unlike your relative who spends far too much time on Facebook, this spread of misinformation has serious consequences.PETA has recognizedPit Bulls as the most abused group of dogs in the country. The Humane Society of the United Statessays that Pit Bull-type dogsare regularly some of the most common breeds found in shelters often as a result of BSL regulations that dissuade their adoption.\nUnfortunately, as we know, thelonger an animal is in a shelter, the more likely they are to be euthanized. This is all to say that these anti-Pit narratives aren’t just disheartening, they can be deadly. So, please put on your ownMythBustershats as you go out into the world and advocate for these gentle pups: They are counting on you.\nReferences:\nASPCA Position Statement on Pit Bulls\nASPCA Position Statement on Pit Bulls\nBan and Outlaw Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) in the United States of America on a Federal Level!\nBan and Outlaw Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) in the United States of America on a Federal Level!\nPETA: Animal Rights Uncompromised: Bans on Breeding Pit Bulls\nPETA: Animal Rights Uncompromised: Bans on Breeding Pit Bulls\nUSHS: All Dogs Are Equal\nUSHS: All Dogs Are Equal",

  "page_content": "Dogs scratch their beds as a natural instinct to create a comfortable, secure spot. This behavior harkens back to their wild ancestors, who scratched to clear debris and create a nesting area. It also helps mark territory with scent glands in their paws, making the space feel safe and familiar.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWhy do dogs scratch their beds?\nThe adorable pup living in your home has evolved from wolves and wild dogs. Because of this, they may still act upon some of the traits and behaviors of their ancestors. You may notice your dog scratching their bed, which helps them get comfortable. Wild dogs and wolves will scratch to make a cozy nest for resting or to settle down for the night just like your dog may. Another instinctual reason a mother dog may dig an area or bed is that they aregoing into labor, and they are preparing the area to have their litter of puppies.\nDogsloveto leave their mark. Dog scent can relay many messages to other dogs. Scent can tell another dog about gender, health status, if they are fixed, and age. Dogs can gather a lot of information about other dogs just from their scent.\nDog paws have scent glands in them, these glands allow them to leave a trail of their scent wherever they go. Scratching is a way to spread that scent in an area, while the dog is scratching debris may go flying through the air spreading their scent even further. Your dog may scratch to leave a message that tells other dogs they were there.\nScratching may be a way your dog de-stresses; it is a self-soothing behavior. Similar to how a human may take deep breaths or use other methods to help destress, your dog may find relief from scratching. Depending on the amount your dog does this, it may be important to take your dog to the vet to help treat them for their anxiety or stress. When a behavior is interfering in your dog's life, it is important to have the issues addressed by a professional.\nMost dogs understand the assignment when it comes to getting comfortable. Your dog may scratch to make a cozy spot for themselves. This can mean scratching to move the pillows or the blankets or just scratching at the area they want to lay on to help make their bed extra comfy. A dog may also use scratching to help them make a comfortable spot on a hot day. Dogs will dig to get to cooler ground where the dirt may feel damp, to help them cool off on a hot day.\nWhat’s behind the desire and whether it’s safe to do.\nHow to protect your dog’s bed from scratching\nTrimming your dog’s nails to an appropriate length is important for many reasons. When dogs have nails that are too long, it can be a hazard to their health. If your dog loves scratching their bed, having long nails can also be a hazard to their bed. Trimming your dog’s nails often can help keep them comfortable with getting theirnails trimmed, and may save their bed from unnecessary holes. Using positive reinforcement and treats while trimming your dog’s nails can also help them tolerate their manicures. Scratch boards exist that can help you file your dog’s nails while fulfilling their want to dig.\nLiving with stress and anxiety can be detrimental to your dog’s health. If your dog’sstress and anxietyare affecting their daily life, you should seek the assistance of a veterinarian to help treat your dog so that they can live a comfortable life. You may also want to enlist the help of a trainer to work with you and your dog to help over come any fears that may be causing the anxiety or stress.\nScratch-proof beds are a great resource for dog parents who have dogs that love to scratch and, over time, wear away at their beds, causing holes. Scratch-proof beds are available for purchase and may help you extend the life of your dog’s bed. They may prevent you from having to replace the bed over and over due to holes from your dog’s scratching.\nDepending on the size and strength of your dog and how hard they move their little paws and nails against the fabric, you can save yourself time and money by purchasing a scratch-proof bed. These beds may be more expensive, but many also have a lifetime guarantee, preventing you from having to buy a dog bed over and over.\nIt’s a personal preference, but here are the pros and cons.\nIs it bad for dogs to scratch their beds?\nThis is a normal behavior that dogs do. If your dog does this behavior to get comfortable, cool off, mark an area, or while they are in labor, this is perfectly fine.\nAs with all behaviors, there is normal, and then there is abnormal. If you find that this is a compulsive behavior that happens over and over to the point of obsession, and you cannot distract or stop your dog from the behavior, this is a cause for alarm. If your dog is scratching to the point of making themselves bleed, this would be another cause for alarm. In this case, contact your vet immediately.\nDogs need more sleep than humans. Here’s how much is healthy.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nThere are many reasons dogs may scratch and dig in their beds. Normal reasons your dog may scratch or dig at their bed include for their comfort, to mark their scent, to regulate their body temperature, or if they are in labor. Some reasons your dog may scratch that are a cause for concern include anxiety, stress, or a compulsive behavior.\nInterrupting your dog by calling their name or gently asking them to stop can prevent your dog from scratching their bed. You can also give your dog appropriate outlets to dig, like in a sandbox that you make for them. Sometimes, fulfilling a behavior appropriately may prevent it from happening somewhere that you do not want it to happen. If you cannot interrupt your dog from doing this behavior, or if it is affecting their daily life, it’s important to contact your vet.\nChoosing the right bed for your dogwho is a scratcher could help prevent you from having to replace the bed due to damage. It may be worth spending the extra money upfront to buy a bed labeled as “indestructible.” It’s important to do your research when purchasing these beds.\nReferences:\nWhy Does My Dog Scratch the Carpet?\nWhy Does My Dog Scratch the Carpet?",

  "page_content": "People receive so much criticism when their dogs have behavioral issues, and it makes many folks feel terrible — guilty and humiliated and flawed and inadequate. If a dog is acting out, especially if they are aggressive, a lot of shame can come with that. But there's enough going on in the world today messing with our mental health, let's not let our dog's training get us down, OK?\nIt's a huge misconception that a dog’s behavior reflects back on their people, and if everyone would just train their dog properly, they would be absolutely lovely in all situations. To this, I am torn between saying, “If only!” and explaining why these ideas are unfair and untrue.I would like to put to rest those judgements that are causing so many people to suffer unnecessarily. There are some very common reasons dogs have behavioral challenges that aren’t about their pet parent. The main reasons dogs have behavioral issues are genetics, trauma, inadequate socialization (COVID wasn’t your fault, was it?!), medical issues, and individuality.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nYes, we can work with our dogs to improve their behavior, and yes, poorly-trained dogs deserve our best training and efforts going forward. Training certainly makes a difference and can help make dogs more polite and more fun to live with, but if people try to tell you that you are the reason your dog has a serious behavioral issue, please know that they are almost certainly wrong.\nHere are the usual suspects.\nThis study says it’s actually less about what’sintheir DNA and more about what’sonit.\nGenetics\nGenes influence behavior. That’s why many dogs act in a similar way to their parents, whether that means being really interested in fetching, having high energy, or being friendly and into snuggles. Genes also play a role in less desirable behavior such as being fearful of strangers or loud noises, lacking impulse control, and a tendency to overeat. Although the environment in which they are raised has a powerful influence over how dogs develop, their genes guide that development and have a powerful effect on who a dog becomes.\nSome dogs have a natural inclination to be patient, to be able to spend time alone without stressing, or to handle fireworks, and it’s easy to develop these qualities in such dogs with minimal effort. For other dogs, these challenges represent a lifelong struggle even with highly skilled training and management. Genes don’t predetermine dog’s behavior, but they are important, influencing the likelihood of developing behavioral issues, despite a lot of variation based on their experiences in life.\nTraumatic experiences\nTrauma can cause dogs to be afraid, and fear so often causes serious behavioral challenges. A majority of dogs who are aggressive toward strangers (people) and to dogs (unfamiliar ones, especially) are acting in this undesirable way because they are scared. If a dog has such a bad experience that they associate people or dogs with pain or being frightened, acting appropriately around them will be a challenge, and such dogs need help to meet this challenge.\nSometimes, the trauma is a long period of abuse, and sometimes it’s a single distressing experience. Dogs may become afraid of dogs if they are playing with a dog while they sustain an injury. They may develop a fear of people if they are with a new person when a terrifying storm passes over without warning.\nIt’s not the best thing they do by any means.\nMissed socialization\nAn insufficient amount of socialization can have a huge impact on a dog’s behavior throughout their life. Socialization aims to expose a puppy to a variety of new experiences during a critical period of their lives, ranging from three weeks of age to about 14 weeks old. Many people welcome a dog into their life when they are  already past the age of socialization, and others were unaware of what to do and how to do it in order to socialize their dogs properly.\nThose of us in the field of dog training and behavior, as well as other dog-related careers, need to do a better job with education to make sure more people socialize their dogs in the appropriate time frame. That said so many dogs were pandemic puppies and as a society, we were collectively unable to give many dogs the socialization they needed at that time.\nEverything you need to know to get your new addition off to a good start.\nMedical issues\nNo matter how much we try to take care of a dog’s health, medical issues can arise that profoundly impact our dog’s behavior. Whether it’s epilepsy, a thyroid problem, a tumor, an injury, an infection, a broken tooth causing pain, hearing or vision loss, there are a large number of medical situations that can lead to various behavioral changes.\nUndesirable behavior due to medical causes can include: acting aggressively, becoming withdrawn or irritable, decreased responsiveness to cues, house soiling in a fully housetrained dog, and discomfort with being left alone, confined to a space, or handled and petted.\nIndividuality\nDogs are each unique, and for a variety of reasons, some dogs are more prone to behavioral challenges than others. Dogs vary greatly in their self-control, frustration tolerance, impulse control, agreeableness, emotional control, general sociability, playfulness, etc. Really, what this means is that each dog is a unique being with their own personality. They each have their own distinct neurology. We can influence dogs’ behavior to some degree, but that doesn’t mean we can change the essence of who they are.\nRepeat it again: not your fault\nDespite what some people may assume, pet parents are not always responsible for their dogs' behavioral issues. Remember that tons of people, even with minimal effort towards training, have dogs who don’t have serious behavioral issues. Are they really better than you? No! (But their luck may be.)",

Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nLet’s break down some of the best dog breeds for first-time pet parents. Whether you’re looking for a low-energy, gentle giant or a non-shedding lap dog, grab a leash and a cup of coffee (trust us, you’ll need it), and let’s dive in. Remember, there are plenty of rescue dogs who need good homes, and you can most likely find the breed or mix you want at a shelter. U.S. shelters are overflowing, so please do your research for breed-specific rescues; you can find the kind of dog you’re looking for while doing a good thing.\nThe dogs — 20 of them puppies — will be available for adoption in the coming weeks.\nBest breeds for first-time dog parents\nFrom the ever-popular Golden Retriever to the spunky Papillon and beyond, here are some top contenders that are known for their friendly demeanor, adaptability, and overall awesomeness.\nThe Golden Retriever is pretty much the OG of family-friendly pups, and they make perfect first dogs. These pups are basically like sunshine on four legs, with their friendly demeanor and ever-wagging tails. Need a buddy for outdoor adventures? They're all in. Want a snuggle partner for movie nights? They've got you covered.\nPlus, they're super smart and easy to train, making them a great pick for first-time pet parents who want a versatile and loving companion.

Grooming-wise, be prepared for some shedding and invest in a good brush to keep their coats in tip-top shape.\nBichon Frisés are like fluffy little clouds on four legs. They’re basically walking cotton balls, with their soft, curly coats and sweet, expressive eyes. Bichons are known for their cheerful disposition and love of a good snuggle, making them ideal companions for first-time pet parents craving close connection. Those luscious locks, however, require regular grooming to prevent matting and keep them looking their fluffiest.\nThese elegant hounds are the ultimate couch potatoes when they’re indoors, but give them an open field to stretch their legs, and they’ll show you just how fast they can go. Greyhounds are known for their gentle and laid-back nature — they’re surprisingly low-maintenance pets, despite their mad agility skills. Their short coats do shed moderately, so regular brushing will help keep the fur situation under control.\nWith their regal demeanor and soulful eyes, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are sure to steal your heart in an instant.

With their butterfly-like ears and sprightly personalities, these little pups are as elegant as they are energetic.

However, their long, silky coats do require regular grooming to prevent matting and tangles.\nWant a purebred? Here’s yet another reason you should rescue one.\nWorst breeds for first-time dog parents\nWhile there’s no bad dog breed (because honestly, we love them all), there are some that aren’t well suited for first-time pet parents. Dogs with extremely high energy, strong guarding tendencies, and lots of grooming needs might give novice dog moms and dads a tough time.\nHigh-energy breeds are like the canine equivalent of a kid on a sugar rush — they’re always on the go and ready for action. While their boundless enthusiasm can be infectious, it can also be a handful for first-time pet parents who may not have the time or energy to match their pup’s pace.\nThese breeds thrive on plenty of exercise and mental stimulation, so if you’re not prepared to commit todaily walks, runs, and play sessions, you might want to think twice before bringing home one of these energetic furballs.Examples: Border Collie, Australian Shepherd, Jack Russell Terrier\nIf you’re not ready to channel your inner hairstylist, dogs withhigh grooming needsare likely not a great option for you. They require lots of regular primping and pampering to keep their coats looking fabulous. While their luxurious locks may be a sight to behold, they also come with a hefty grooming commitment that may not be ideal for first-time pet parents with busy schedules or limited grooming experience.\nFrom brushing and bathing to trimming and styling, these breeds demand a significant time and effort investment to maintain their pristine appearance.\nExamples: Afghan Hound, Standard Poodle, Shih Tzu\nWhat is the best dog breed for me?\nBefore you commit to a new canine companion, there are a few important factors to consider to ensure you find the perfect match for your lifestyle and personality. From size and energy level to grooming needs and trainability, we’re breaking down everything you need to know to find the best dog breed for you.\nSize matters — especially when it comes to choosing the right dog breed for your home. Whether you’re living in a cozy apartment or sprawling countryside estate, it’s important to consider how much space your new family member will need to thrive. Larger breeds may require more room to stretch their legs, while smaller breeds can adapt well to apartment living. So, before you bring home that adorable ball of fluff, make sure you have enough space to accommodate their size and energy levels.\nReady to keep up with a four-legged tornado of energy? Or looking for a laid-back couch potato to cuddle up with? Energy level is a crucial factor to consider when choosing the right dog breed for your lifestyle. High-energy breeds such as Border Collies and Huskies thrive on plenty of exercise and mental stimulation, while low-energy breeds such as Basset Hounds and Saint Bernards prefer lounging around the house. It’s a good idea to give some thought to how much time and energy you're willing to invest in keeping your pup happy and healthy.\nGrooming needs\nFrom daily brushing and regular baths to monthly haircuts and occasional trims, grooming needs can vary widely depending on the breed. Love spending hours at the salon getting pampered? Then a high-maintenance breed might be right up your alley. But if you’re more of a wash-and-go type of person, you’ll want to opt for a low-maintenance breed that won’t require as much grooming.\nSome pups are eager to please and quick to learn, while others just…aren’t. Trainability is an important factor to consider when choosing the right dog breed for your family. Some breeds, such as Golden Retrievers and Labrador Retrievers, are known for their intelligence and trainability.\nOthers, such as Beagles and Dachshunds, may be a bit more stubborn and independent, requiring extra patience and consistency during training sessions. Think about your training goals and how much time and effort you're able to invest in teaching your pup the ropes.\nWhen choosing the right dog breed for your family, it’s important to consider their compatibility with children and other animals. Some breeds are known for their gentle and tolerant nature, while others may be more wary of small children or prone to conflicts with other animals. Before you make your decision, think about your family dynamic and choose a breed that will fit in seamlessly with your lifestyle and existing pack members.\nFurther proof that you can — and should — adopt rescued designer dogs.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nWhen looking for dog breeds suitable for first-timepet parents in apartments, people tend to prioritize small size, adaptability, and moderate energy levels. Consider breeds such as Yorkshire Terriers, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, and Bichon Frisés.\nBreeds with high energy levels, strong guarding tendencies, or extensive grooming requirements may not be ideal for novice pet parents. Examples include breeds such as Border Collies, German Shepherds, Chow Chows, and Afghan Hounds. These breeds often require experienced handling, consistent training, and a dedicated grooming regimen, making them less suitable for new pet parents.\nSeveralmedium-sized breedsstand out as being good for first-time pet parents for their manageable size, friendly temperament, and adaptability.

However, if your dog is doing this frequently, especially to other people who may not be as understanding, and/or if it really bothers you, it’s important to stop the behavior. This is not only foryourbenefit, but also for your dog’s benefit. Excessive mounting behavior is a sign of a problem, either behavioral or medical, and your dog needs help.\nReasons why your dog may hump you\nDogs may exhibit mounting behavior due to behavioral or medical reasons. Sometimes there is overlap between medical and behavioral reasons, too. The most common causes include:\nDisplacement behavior: Basically, this is the idea that a dog exhibits a behavior as an outlet for other emotional energy. For example, if your dog is very excited, frustrated, oranxious about a situation, they may displace that energy through an activity like humping.\nDisplacement behavior: Basically, this is the idea that a dog exhibits a behavior as an outlet for other emotional energy.

For example, is this a person your dog is very attached to, or someone they are unsure of? Does this tend to happen during moments of excitement and play, or during times when your dog seems fearful? Is this happening on your home turf or when you go out to a specific place?\nAnalyzing the context will help explain your pup’s behavior. They may be humping their favorite person out of excitement or when they are seeking attention after being separated for long periods of time. Or, they may be humping someone they see as a stranger when they don’t know how to interact with them. There may be many other permutations to explain their behavior, too, so look for context clues.\nNormal vs. excessive dog humping: when is it time to get help?\nHow to stop your dog from humping you\nAs you may have surmised by now, there is no one-size-fits-all quick fix for every over-eager humper.

  "page_content": "Dogs eating rocks, a behaviorknown as pica, can stem from various underlying causes, including nutritional deficiencies, boredom, anxiety, or certain medical conditions. While occasional curiosity about rocks is normal, persistent rock eating can pose serious health risks to your dog.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWhy does my dog try to eat rocks? Causes of pica in dogs\nPica is the behavior of eating non-food substances. Pica can be seen in dogs of all ages and breeds. Dogs with pica will eat anything, and commonly ingested materials include dirt, grass, fabric, and rocks. Figuring out why a dog may actuallywantto eat a rock can be difficult, but the behavior can be dangerous and a sign of a behavioral or medical issue. Reasons that dogs may eat rocks include:\nSome dogs will instinctively crave dirt and rocks when they have underlying deficiencies in essential minerals like iron or zinc. Nutritional deficiencies can develop due to inadequate intake. Dogs who eat raw and homemade diets are often at higher risk of developing nutritional deficiencies when their diets are not properly formulated and prepared.\nDigestive diseases like exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and inflammatory bowel disease can cause poor absorption of ingested nutrients. Anemia from any cause (blood loss, bone marrow disease, immune-mediated, etc) is a known cause of pica in dogs.\nDogs like to explore with their mouths, and when they encounter a rock with an interesting scent or texture, they may be tempted to give it a taste. Many dogs chew on objects as a part of play, so they may turn to rocks to satisfy their urge to chew when not provided with appropriate chew toys.\nSteroids like prednisone are used to treat many different health issues in dogs. Side effects of steroids include increased thirst and hunger. This can lead to behavior changes like constantly begging for food or opting to satisfy an insatiable appetite by eating things that aren’t food.\nStress can cause dogs to exhibit various behaviors, including pica and excessive chewing. Some dogs turn to chewing on rocks as a way to cope with anxiety, which can lead to accidental or intentional rock ingestion. Dogs are more likely to engage in these behaviors during thunderstorms, fireworks, environmental changes, or if they have underlying separation anxiety.\nPuppies go through a teething phase from around five weeks to six months of age. Puppies are known to be mouthy and chewing can help soothe a teething puppy’s achy gums. However, puppies don’t always make the best decisions and may seek out rocks or other inappropriate objects to gnaw on, especially if they aren’t provided with appropriate teething toys.\nWhat to do when your dog has questionable tastes.\nRelated pica behaviors\nWhen witnessing the abnormal habits associated with pica disorder, dog parents are often left wondering, “Why does my dog eat dirt, rocks, and wood?” This behavior can extend beyond objects found in the yard. Other pica behaviors include eating:\nFeces from themselves or other animals (coprophagy).\nFeces from themselves or other animals (coprophagy).\nMetallic objects like coins, jewelry, or nails (this is especially dangerous if the metalcontains zinc).\nMetallic objects like coins, jewelry, or nails (this is especially dangerous if the metalcontains zinc).\nFabrics like bedding, clothing, andsocks.\nFabrics like bedding, clothing, andsocks.\nPaper products, books, and cardboard.\nPaper products, books, and cardboard.\nPlastic and rubber\nPlastic and rubber\nHealth risks associated with rock eating\nDog parents should immediately address the behavior if a dog is eating rocks. Seek veterinary advice to determine if immediate treatment, careful monitoring, or behavior modification is recommended. Rock eating in dogs carries serious health risks, including:\nChewing rocks can lead to cracked or broken teeth in dogs. Dental damage can lead to the need for veterinary tooth repair or removal.\nStomach acid can’t digest rocks, so a dog that eats a bunch of small rocks or even just one large rock is at risk for developing anintestinal obstruction. Rocks that get stuck in the gastrointestinal tract can cause obstructions that require surgical intervention. Sharp rocks can cause perforations in the intestinal wall, leading to the need for intestinal resection, a more complicated surgery.\nEven if a rock is able to make it all the way through a dog’s gastrointestinal tract, that doesn’t mean that the dog will enjoy the journey. Rocks can cause pain as they move down the esophagus and through the intestines. It can also be painful for a dog to pass rocks in their poop.\nWhen thinking about dogs eating rocks, we often imagine large stones, but smaller rocks, fine gravel, or sand (from a litter box orbeach) can also be ingested. Once these tiny rocks reach the colon, the body removes water from the material around them, creating hard, gritty stool that is difficult for the dog to pass.\nA (seemingly) unstoppable nibbling obsession with all the blankets.\nTreatment for dogs eating rocks\nDetermining if your dog is eating rocks due to a medical or behavioral issue will help guide how to proceed with treatment and avoid rock ingestion in the future. Treatment forpica syndrome in dogsvaries, but can include:\nYour veterinarian may recommend blood work or other diagnostics to help identify nutritional deficiencies or underlying health conditions that require medication, medical treatments, or a diet change. Dog parents should always ensure to feed a complete and balanced diet that meets AAFCO standards for their dog’s life stage.\nDogs thrive off consistency, so establish a routine that adds predictability to your dog’s day. If your pup gets separation anxiety, consult with a vet or veterinary behaviorist to help identify your dog’s triggers and methods for desensitization and conditioning. Have a stress-reduction plan in place for anxiety-inducing events like thunderstorms, fireworks, or construction.\nSome dogs are just determined to gnaw on rocks just for the hell of it, so dedicated dog parents have to go to great lengths tolimit their dog’s access to rocks.

    "title": "Understanding Reactivity and Aggression in Dogs: Two Very Different Things",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/reactive-vs-aggressive-dog"
  },
  "page_content": "Historically, the term “aggression” was used broadly to encompass various troublesome behaviors which can be problematic, such as barking, growling,lunging, and snarling. Unfortunately, there is a lot of shame associated with having a dog who is labeled “aggressive.” It’s not as loaded a term as an “angry dog,” but it still makes many dog parents feel bad unnecessarily.\nThe introduction of the term “reactivity”  aimed to address this issue by providing a more neutral, less judgy label for certain behaviors. The term “reactivity” came about in part to assuage people’s shame about having an aggressive dog which is why some of the first uses of the word involved discussing “leash reactivity” which is essentially the same behavior that has long been called “leash aggression.”\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nReactivity refers to a response to a stimulus that is perceived as excessive or intense, while aggression traditionally involves behavior with the intent to harm. Many people consider the term “reactive” more appropriate for their dog, and are more comfortable using it. The fact is that dogs are either aggressive or reactive based on the descriptions above, but some dogs are accurately called both aggressiveandreactive. Rather than focusing on labels, try to focus on addressing specific behaviors, because aggressive dog training and reactive dog training involve the same skills and require the same knowledge to be successful.\nWhen your dog growls, they’re expressing their emotions. A study found that you’ll likely be able to understand what they’re feeling.\nWhat is reactivity?\nReactivity is frequently used to mean a response to a stimulus or a trigger that is over the top — usually based on big emotions, as we say these days. Part of the challenge of using the term “reactive” is that it requires us to determine whether a dog’s response to something is excessive, and that depends on many variables: what caused the dog to react, what a normal response would look like, and so on.\nThe idea is that a reactive dog is one who is responding to a stimulus in any way that is beyond what the situation calls for. That can include dogs who are so happy to see people or dogs, or a specific person or a dog (or even a toy) that they respond with excessive enthusiasm. It can also include dogs who get extremely aroused because of a negative emotional response when they see people or dogs (or even other animals, or if they hear certain sounds) and appear incapable of exercising the proper amount of self-control.\nReactivity is a subjective construction because it means a response to a situation or a trigger that is more intense than expected by a typical dog. So, a dog who barks when the doorbell rings but then stops and calmly greets the visitors would not generally be called reactive.\nHow to teach your pup to play nice.\nBut a dog who barks in response to the doorbell and slams their body into the door over and over while spinning, leaping, barking ever louder, and being inconsolable would reasonably be called reactive. These cases are not going to prompt much argument, but what about all the variation that’s in between these two extremes? It’s not easy to determine the line between behavior that indicates reactivity and typical canine behavior involving some level of excitement. Basically, the answer to “What is a reactive dog?” depends on who you ask.\nWhat is aggression?\nAggression is historically used to indicate something about intention, because a common definition of aggression is behavior with the intent to harm another individual. There are people who vehemently disagree with the inclusion of intent as a part of the definition of aggression because it is not possible to know for certain what a dog’s intention is. They prefer to look only at the behavior without ascribing any intent to the dog exhibiting the behavior. It’s a fair argument that it’s more useful to describe what a dog does than to label them an aggressive dog.\nSo, sometimes the definition is “any behavior that causes harm to another individual or threatens to.” An issue with this definition is that a situation that causes harm could also just happen from an accident a dog has, such as falling off a surface, like the couch, and scratching someone on the way down unintentionally or knocking someone over when greeting them exuberantly. Ugh — definitions are so hard!\nStep one: Never put your face close to theirs.\nAggression is just one of many types of behavior that fall under the category of “agonistic behavior,” which is any social behavior that relates to fightsor contests. The other ones are threats, displays, placating, and reconciliation. Threats, displays, and placating behavior can reduce tension and lower the likelihood of aggression.\nOver time, threats and displays have been lumped in with aggressive behavior by dogs, which means that some behaviors that may actually prevent harm to one dog (or a person) by another dog have been included in the category of aggression. That leads to a weird situation in which many of the behaviors we describe as aggressive in dogs are actually agonistic behaviors that have theintenttoreduceconflict and toavoidfighting.\nThe truth: Defining dog behavior is complicated.\nTrying to define all behavior precisely and accurately is inherently problematic because we are trying to overlay a simplistic form of clarity over the truly complicated nature of behavior. Definitions seek to make things simple and easy to understand, but that is really difficult because of how complicated behavior is, especially when conflict and arousal are involved.\nReactivity alludes to the emotional aspects of what is going on, and “aggression” more commonly refers to intent and to the possibility of injury. Many people find it frustrating that reactivity is so often confused with aggression, but that’s not surprising, given that the terms are not mutually exclusive. If you try to sort all dogs with certain types of undesirable behavior into those who are aggressive and those who are reactive, it’s impossible because you are trying to fit three categories of dogs into just two categories.\nExpert advice for people with dogs who jump, bark, and generally go nuts when people come over.\nSome dogs, based on a general understanding of the terms, are both reactiveandaggressive. Their emotions are over the top, and they may hurt someone. Others are just reactive. They are highly aroused and respond to other individuals in an intense way, but they never hurt them or try to hurt them. Andsome dogs are just aggressive, but not reactive. I’ve met dogs in this last category, though I think it is the rarest of the three groups. Those particular dogs may bite, and even cause a high level of damage, but they do so without any of the emotional arousal so typical of most scenarios. (Usually, a dog who bites iseither fearful— this is the most common emotional state of dogs who bite — or frustrated or in a high state of arousal.) Dogs who seem emotionless when they bite and exhibit no emotion after the bite remind me of movie depictions of hit men. I picture them saying, in their dog language, “This is not personal. It’s just business,” before they seriously injure someone with a bite.\nI tend to recognize the term aggression the way that most people who book appointments with me use the term — to indicate any behavior that gives them a bad feeling that someone could get hurt by the teeth of their dog. That refers to all the barking,growling, lunging, cold stares, tooth displays, nips, air snaps, and bites.\nYou can’t reliably distinguish aggression and reactivity based on body language alone. Both aggressive and reactive dogs can bark, lunge, growl, run, tuck their tales, leap around, cower, exhibit piloerection, pin their ears, show their teeth, or give a fear grimace, among other behaviors.\nAggression has to do with intent and injury, but also relates to conflict resolution, and reactivity has to do with excessive arousal, but reactivity and aggression are not mutually exclusive. Arousal is one cause of aggression and a dog who is reacting excessively fearfully can behave in an aggressive manner because of their fearfulness.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nFocus more on the behavior, less on the label.\nI know it’s a wild dream that will never come true, but it would be my preference to focus on the behavior and avoid labeling it. Labels have value for brevity and ease of communication, but so much is lost when we group large numbers of dogs into a small number of categories because of a desire to define behavior. Additionally, without any clear consensus on what these terms mean, clarification is always needed when we communicate with one another, and when someone uses either of these terms. Rather than say a dog is aggressive or a dog is reactive, I like to say, “This dog barks and lunges atunfamiliar peoplewho she sees while on leash” or “This dog bites people who reach for him.”\nAn emphasis on describing the behavior rather than defining it avoids the confusion that can arise when the terms “aggressive” and “reactive” mean different things to different people.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nAll dogs, including those who arereactive and aggressive(or both), should be trained with positive reinforcement and patience. Set dogs up for success, have reasonable goals, and use management to keep everyone safe and relaxed.\nThe knowledge and skills of professional behaviorists and trainers are assets when working to improve the behavior of any dog, but are essential for appropriate safety measures and good progress with aggressive and reactive dogs.\nSeek professional help from a qualified canine behaviorist or dog trainer, and consult with your veterinarian to rule out medical causes if you have had the very distressing experience of your dog biting you.\nReferences:\nBehavioural Testing For Aggression in the Domestic Dog\nBehavioural Testing For Aggression in the Domestic Dog\nFactors Associated With Aggressive Responses in Pet Dogs\nFactors Associated With Aggressive Responses in Pet Dogs\nUnderstanding Dog Aggression: Epidemiologic Aspects: In Memoriam, Rudy de Meester (1953-2012)\nUnderstanding Dog Aggression: Epidemiologic Aspects: In Memoriam, Rudy de Meester (1953-2012)\nAn Overview of Types of Aggressive Behaviour in Dogs and Methods of Treatment\nAn Overview of Types of Aggressive Behaviour in Dogs and Methods of Treatment\nManaging the Risk of Aggressive Dog Behavior: Investigating the Influence of Owner Threat and Efficacy Perceptions\nManaging the Risk of Aggressive Dog Behavior: Investigating the Influence of Owner Threat and Efficacy Perceptions",

  "page_content": "We all know the frustration of trying to agree on a restaurant with a friend who’s a less-than-adventurous eater. But at least picky (or, as they’d probably put it,specific) humans can communicate their preferences — or make themselves a sandwich for the road.\nAnimals aren’t so lucky, and they can be just as fussy. And since our dogs don’t speak English or do their own grocery shopping, it can be frustrating to get to the bottom of exactly what they want. Not to mention, it’s freaky when a pup won’t eat, and it can get dangerous for their health...fast.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nIt might be hard to imagine a dognotwanting to eat something compared to a cat (whether that “something” is their kibble or your cheeseburger) — but dogs can be as particular as the next creature. “We do see picky eaters among dogs, especially in smaller breeds,” explainsveterinary nutritionist Dr. Sally Perea.\nSo, how do you cope when a dog is turning their nose up at all the dinner options you're offer them? Dr. Perea has some tips.\nLearn what nutrients are a must for your new little one.\nIntroduce variety early.\nVariety is, as they say, the spice of life. As pet parents, we have to show our pets a variety of foods as early as possible to get them used to different experiences. Otherwise, they can become stuck in their ways.\nIntroducing a range of textures early is particularly important. Pets who get used to dry food early may struggle to adjust to wet food later in life. Dr. Perea recommends that pet parents feed their pets wet and dry food from the start. Gently cooked, pre-portioned options like those made byNom Nomcontain a variety of textures that dogs crave.\nExperiment with food taste, texture, and temperature.\nIf your pet won’t eat, you might need to guess at exactly what it is about their food that’s bothering them. “If you have a picky eater, especially a dog, experimenting with a variety of foods and food forms can be helpful,” Dr. Perea says. “Some dogs may prefer a dry or wet form over the other.”\nTemperature can be another factor to consider. Dogs often prefer for their meals to be warmed up. “Warming any wet foods to room temperature (if normally kept in cold storage) is helpful to increase the palatability and aroma of the food,” Dr. Perea says.\nFrom DIY ice-fruit bowls to dog-friendly ice cream, they will be chillin’.\nIf transitioning diets, take it slow.\nDogs — especially those who weren’t exposed to a variety of flavors and textures when they were young — can sometimes avoid eating if they’re starting on a new food. According to theAmerican Kennel Club(AKC), dogs should transition to a new diet between five to seven days. But talk to your vet about your individual pet and what they recommend (it may take longer than a week).\nYou’ll want to begin by feeding your pet both their old and new food, with only 25 percent of the meal being made up of the new food. You can then gradually increase the ratio until they’re eating 100 percent new food.\nTry food toppers.\nFood toppers can help encourage a pet to interact with their food — sort of like covering a kid’s broccoli in cheese.“Many dogs do respond well to toppers, which could include a wet or gently cooked food,” Dr. Perea says. “These can help spark the dog’s interest in the food, and is a fun way to add variety to a dry kibble.”\nDr. Perea adds that homemade toppers should be prepared and given thoughtfully. “The rule of thumb is that unbalanced home-prepared foods or treats should not exceed 10 percent of the pet’s daily calories,” Dr. Perea says.\nIf you don’t have the time (or patience) to make a nutritionally balanced topper at home, try Nom Nom's delicious gently cooked food to add a little excitement and variety to your dog's bowl. Plus, you can alsoget 50 percent off your first box.\nAnother caveat: If your pet is on a therapeutic diet, “additions or toppers can interfere with the efficacy of the therapeutic food,” Dr. Perea says. “Your veterinarian or veterinary nutritionists can help guide you to the best options for your pet.”\nFrom kale to quinoa, these nutrient-packed picks deserve a spot in your dog’s food bowl.\nKnow when to see a veterinarian.\nPicky eating isn’t always a choice — sometimes it points to a larger health problem. “Underlying metabolic conditions, such as poor kidney or liver function are two examples where the pet parent may begin to notice a reduced appetite,” Dr. Perea says.\nThat doesn’t mean that every instance of picky eating is due to an illness. Dr. Perea recommends looking out for any changes in a pet’s behavior, first and foremost. “If you know your pet to normally be a picky eater, then poor food intake may be less worrisome,” she says. “The key is to look for a change or trending change in the pet.” She adds that weight loss is another sign that something is wrong with a pet’s health.\nYou should also see a veterinarian if picky eating is accompanied by a change in water intake. “If you see your pet change their drinking habits (either increased or decreased water consumption), then this is something to discuss with your veterinarian,” Dr. Perea says.\nAnd if your pet starts skipping meals all together, it’s important to get them to a veterinarian. If your pet hasn’t eaten for 24 to 48 hours, they should see a vet.\nReferences:\nHow to Switch & Transition Dog Food\nHow to Switch & Transition Dog Food\nShould You Warm Up Your Dog’s Food?\nShould You Warm Up Your Dog’s Food?",

  "page_content": "Dogs are loyal companions, enthusiastic tail-waggers, and occasional couch thieves. They’re also master communicators, using barks, tail wags, soulful stares, body language, and whining to express their emotions. Sometimes, those soft, high-pitched sounds are endearing. Other times, whining can be annoying, especially when you don’t understand how to interpret what your dog is trying to say.\nBefore you start looking for dog psychologists, take a deep breath. Whining is a sign that your dog needs attention — not necessarily an emergency, but something worth addressing. Here’s a breakdown ofwhy dogs whine, what you can do to ensure you don’t get a headache, and that your pup is well-understood and cared for.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nMain takeaways\nDogs whine to express needs or emotions such as attention, discomfort, fear, boredom, or excitement.\nDogs whine to express needs or emotions such as attention, discomfort, fear, boredom, or excitement.\nPersistent or unusual whining may indicate pain or medical issues, and your pup should be evaluated by a veterinarian.\nPersistent or unusual whining may indicate pain or medical issues, and your pup should be evaluated by a veterinarian.\nObserving context clues and body language helps determine whether whining signals an urgent need or a less critical request.\nObserving context clues and body language helps determine whether whining signals an urgent need or a less critical request.\nPositive reinforcement training and sufficient exercise and stimulation can reduce unnecessary whining.\nPositive reinforcement training and sufficient exercise and stimulation can reduce unnecessary whining.\nProfessional trainers can address underlying issues like anxiety, helping improve communication and minimize excessive whining.\nProfessional trainers can address underlying issues like anxiety, helping improve communication and minimize excessive whining.\nWhy is your dog whining all the time?\nDogs are social animals, and whining is often a way to grab your attention. They may be hungry, bored, or need pets and affection. If whining gets a reaction from you — even a frustrated one — they’ve learned that it works.\nWhining can be a way for dogs to tell you that something hurts. According toDr. Alisha Kidwell, an experienced and reliable veterinarian at North Carolina’s Cabarrus Animal Hospital, persistent whining often indicates discomfort or pain. Schedule a trip to the vet if your dog’s whining seems unusual, and they are limping, licking a particular spot, or showing signs of distress.\nSometimes, whining is a dog’s way of making a polite request. Do they need to go outside? Do they want a treat from the cookie jar? If your dog stares at you while whining, they need you to decipher their canine code.\nLoud noises, unfamiliar environments, and new people or animals in the house can trigger whining. This is how dogs can express anxiety, and sometimes whining indicates unease. They feel stressed, anxious, or fearful if their ears are pinned back or their tails are tucked.\nA bored dog is whinier than average. If your dog lacks mental or physical stimulation, they may whine because they have nothing better to do. It is their version of asking you to play or do something with them.\nIf your dog starts whining when you leave the room or house, they may have separation anxiety. Dogs with this condition whine excessively. They may pace or become destructive when alone because all their energy is focused on how they feel when separated from you.\nNot all whining is negative. Sometimes dogs whine because they feel excited. Their body language expresses excitement, such as joyful eyes and a wagging tail. They are letting you know they can’t wait for whatever comes next.\nIt’s the saddest sound in the world.\nWhat to do about excessive whining in dogs\nSome dogs are dramatic, using whining to test the patience of the most loving pet parents. The key to restoring peace in your home is to discover why your dog is whining. Remember, whining is a dog’s way of communicating, so your job is to pay attention to the pitch and body language to figure out why they’re expressing themselves this way.\nThere are practical ways to manage and minimize whining. You can turn whining into a manageable method of communication by ruling out medical concerns, paying attention to patterns, and setting clear boundaries.\nContact a veterinarian to rule out health problems. If your dog’s whining is sudden, unusual, or paired with symptoms like a change in appetite or lethargic behavior, there could be something medically amiss.\nWhen, where, and why is your dog whining? Are they whining near their food bowl at dinnertime? Are they sitting by the window and whining at the neighbors? Pay attention to your dog’s behavior and body language. Context clues can help you decode their whining.\nSome whining deserves immediate attention (like if they are in pain or need to go outside). Other times, whining is less urgent, like when your dog is begging for leftover sandwich crusts while you’re eating lunch. Learn to prioritize so you don’t spend your day catering to your dog’s demands.\nHold off for a few minutes if your dog is whining for attention. Don’t give in immediately. Wait until they calm down, then reward them with praise, treats, and affection. This teaches them that silence and peace — not whining — earn your attention and positive response.\nTired dogs are typically quiet and peaceful. Daily walks, playtime, and mentally stimulating toys can help burn off excess energy, reducing the risk of whining out of boredom. A bored dog is a toddler on a sugar high. Keep them busy, and they will whine less.\nTo pet parents, awhimpering dog sounds as sad as a crying baby. Here’s why.\nWhen should you work with a professional trainer for help?\nIf your dog’s whining stems from issues like fear or anxiety, a professional trainer can help. They can assist with tackling the root cause of the whining — not just the symptoms. Think of it as therapy for your pup and peace of mind for you.\nTrainers can teach you tools and techniques to better understand and communicate with your dog. They help you foster a stronger bond and more precise boundaries, whether helping your dog build confidence or learning self-soothing behaviors. Professional guidance can make a difference byteaching your dog(and you) to unlearn habits that may be distressing or triggering, contributing to whining.\nProfessional dog trainers often spot subtle cues or triggers you may otherwise overlook. They can help you address whining issues more effectively, setting up you and your pup for long-term success.\nFAQs\nSometimes. You should ignore a whining dog when they are begging for attention, and you’re sure nothing is immediately wrong. Ignoring them teaches them that whining won’t work to get your attention. However, if they’re in pain, scared, or requesting something (like going outside), don’t ignore them —address the issue.\nSome dog breeds are more vocal than others. For instance, Siberian Huskies, Beagles, and Dachshunds are notable chatterboxes, and whining is part of their reputations. However, they can be trained to stop whining unless something is wrong.\nIf whining is sudden, excessive, or paired with symptoms like limping, vomiting, or lack of appetite, it’s cause for concern. Your vet will help you figure out if something is wrong.\nReferences\n“Why Is My Dog Whining So Much All of a Sudden – [Vet Explains Pets].”Vetexplainspets.com, 2024,vetexplainspets.com/why-is-my-dog-whining-so-much-all-of-a-sudden.

  "page_content": "Ah, fall. You can feel it already, can’t you? There’s a faint chill in the breeze, pumpkin spice lattes are back on the streets, and so are the big yellow school buses. For us autumn lovers, it’s heaven, but for some dogs, this time of year can be a special kind of hell.\nIf your dog is anxious around children or crowds, back-to-school season can be a challenge. You love your walks together, but the sight of your poor, anxious pooch shaking as gaggles of kids walk by can be heartbreaking. Thankfully, there’s plenty you can do to bolster your dog’s confidence.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWe spoke with two certified trainers and a veterinary behaviorist to gather all the best techniques. Above all, our experts agree that it’s crucial to recognize and respect your dog as a sentient, autonomous being with feelings.\n“Each dog has their own likes and dislikes as well as comfort levels,” says Stephanie Barger, dog trainer and owner ofCanine Zen, which offers remote dog training throughout the United States. “They are not robots that just do whatever we say because we say it. You want to nurture your bond with your dog and help them to feel safe.”\nPro tips for boosting the confidence of a scaredy-cat dog.\nWhat body language do dogs use to tell us they’re scared or uncomfortable?\nWe’ve all heard that a dog holding their tail between their legs is unhappy, but canine body language is more complicated than that. Some dogs might wag their tails even when frightened. Watch how your dog carries his whole body instead.\nJulia Albright, a veterinary behaviorist at the University of Tennessee, notes that many dogs will begin to show their anxiety through subtle avoidance behaviors. “You’ll see things, likelip-licking, yawning, turning the head away,” she says. If you’re walking your dog on a leash near a group of children, their behavior might escalate because they can’t get away. “That tail is going to go down and be tucked,” Albright says. “The whites of their eyes are going to show. Quite often, their ears go back. That can be easier to tell on some dogs than the other.”\nRayanne Craven, a Mississippi-based trainer, notes that other signs of stress can include tight, closed lips; panting when it’s not warm outside; scanning the area and acting jumpy; crouching or walking low to the ground; and rejecting treats.\n“It’s important to watch your dog and notice what their body language is when they are relaxed at home so you can be able to noticewhen they are stressedin places or situations,” Craven says. Some signs are more obvious — like pulling on the leash to escape, whining, barking, growling, or snapping.\nAccording to Barger, dogs generally display more subtle signs of fear before they become aggressive or panic, but pet parents often overlook those early cues. Barger’s list of warning signs includes the eyes — hard versus soft stare, dilated pupils, exposed whites — as well as a stiff tail, sweaty paws, flexed toes, and stiff body movements.\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nHow can pet parents train puppies to socialize with children and not be afraid of big crowds?\nIf you’re raising a puppy, make sure they get enough safe exposure to children and crowds during their prime socialization period to feel comfortable in the future. All three of our experts agree that these outings should be enriching but not overwhelming. “With puppies,” Craven says, “you want to make sure that every socialization experience they have is a positive one.”\nAccording to theAmerican Veterinary Medical Association(AVMA), the prime socialization period for puppies runs from three to 14 weeks of age. Albright says this can last until 16 weeks. Gradually expose your puppy to the wider world in small, carefully moderated doses during this time.\nYour puppy won’t be fully vaccinated until 20 weeks, so you’ll need to minimize any exposure to pathogens. “For example,” Barger suggests, “take your puppy out for a ‘walk’ while carrying them so that they can experience kids gathering at the bus stop while they are not fully vaccinated.” Along the way, your puppy will also get used to things like cars, bikes, skateboards, and buses.\nCraven urges pet parents to start small with these adventures — like walking for five to 10 minutes at a distance from a big crowd or playground full of children. “Bring super tasty treats and even a chew toy and sit with your puppy rewarding them for just watching at a distance while they take treats from you or work on their chew toy,” she says.\nThis is where knowing your dog’s body language becomes vital. “If they want to move away, let them,” Craven says. “Over several sessions, you can move closer to the playground or large crowd, or if they are comfortable, even let them greet a child or two, but continue to keep the sessions short.”\nAlbright warns pet parents not to “flood” their dogs — meaning, put them in stressful situations for the sake of getting them used to it. Just because a dog is good with a familiar child or two at home, “don’t assume they’re going to be OK with five unfamiliar children running up to them at a bus stop.”\nYou love that your dog is your shadow, but maybe not when you’re on a Zoom call.\nWhat do you do if your dog is already afraid of children?\nAdjust your walking route and schedule to avoid children as much as possible. This will reduce your dog’s stress, and therefore their anxiety. From there, you can begin working with a professional to boost their confidence.\n“When looking for help with behavior modification, you want to find someone using positive reinforcement techniques and who go at the dog’s pace,” Barger says. “Behavior modification takes time and is not a linear process, so working with someone who not only knows this but can support you when things don't move as quickly as you would like is important to your long-term success.”\nIf your dog becomes comfortable enough to interact with children, coach the kids first on how best to approach. We should all seek consent before petting a dog, Albright says, ideally by standing five or 10 feet away and calling them over. Make sure kids know how to offer their affection as well. You don’t want to hover your hand above a dog’s head; instead, offer an open palm in front of them below chin level.\nIf your dog’s fear of children seems sudden, ask your veterinarian for a full workup and exam to rule out any potential medical concerns.\n“I have heard of cases where the dog had a fear of children, either suddenly, or the fear had worsened, and come to find out there was a medical condition that was causing the dog pain and stress,” Craven says. Once any medical issues have been cleared, your dog might be more receptive to training.\nAnd what to do when they go careening away from the Roomba.\nHow do you help adult dogs become better at dealing with large crowds?\nWe want our dogs to live full, happy lives, but this also means respecting their boundaries. Some dogs might never feel comfortable in these situations, and in those cases, our experts suggest that it’s likely better to let them stay at home where they feel safe.\nAlbright puts it simply: “When people say, ‘Can you train your dog to deal with crowds of people?’ the real answer is ‘Maybe, but should you?’”\nIf you and a professional determine that training would be beneficial, proceed slowly. Systematic desensitization uses positive reinforcement to help your dog progressively become more comfortable around triggers. This might mean learning to walk slightly closer to crowds or tolerate louder, more rambunctious children (or a greater number of children) nearby. Work with a professional to evaluate your dog’s body language and use reward-based training to establish positive associations with the things that make them uncomfortable.\nMaybe you start by training in the same area as (but at a safe distance from) a calm child who is occupied with something else. Over time, Barger says, “you would then increase the activity level, the number of children involved or decrease the distance as your dog becomes more comfortable.”\nYou’ll want to keep these training sessions short and sweet, especially at first. Barger usually limits high-stress exercises to 15 to 20 minutes per day and often shorter. “You want to give your dog time to decompress before exposing them to the scary thing again,” she says. “So, some dogs need a day or two off between training sessions.”\nDuring these training sessions, let your dog’s emotions set the pace. It’s up to us to show our dogs that we know how to keep them safe, and forcing them into situations where they feel unsafe might lead to aggression later on. Although it might be embarrassing to stand next to your dog while they bark endlessly on a leash, avoid the temptation to shut down their emotional responses. That, too, is important information.\nDid you get a dog for emotional support and now they are the one who needs it?\nHow do you train fearful dogs to peacefully walk away from a crowd or avoid children during walks?\nBefore you work on training, make sure you’ve done everything you can to make walks peaceful. If your usual route goes past a school or bus stop, walk in a different direction and avoid pick-up and drop-off hours. If you see a cluster of kids approaching, cross the street or make a turn to distance yourself.\nThe more you limit your dog’s exposure to triggers, the easier your daily strolls will become. Still, occasional encounters are inevitable. In those moments, redirect your dog to something positive.\n“It is usually possible to change your dog’s behavior if they are given enough distance from the thing that scares them and an alternative behavior to do that is rewarding to them,” Barger says. One technique is called nose-targeting — which means training your dog to “touch” a target (for example, an outstretched hand) with the tip of their nose.\nCraven suggests trying outControl Unleashed Pattern Gamesfrom certified dog behavior consultant and author Leslie McDevitt. These games help distract dogs from perceived threats by giving them something more fun to do. Craven particularly likes theOne-Two-Three Pattern Game, in which you teach the dog that whenever you say “three” they get a treat. Little treats are crucial in life, and in this case, they can be the difference between a pleasant walk and utter chaos.\nIf you worry that your dog might bite someone, you might want to train them to become comfortable wearing a well-fitted muzzle. This will not only help prevent bites, Craven says, but also communicate to others (especially children) that your dog probably doesn’t want to be touched. Check outThe Muzzle Up! Project forhelp with muzzle fittingand training.\nStep one: Never put your face close to theirs.\nWhat should you do if your dog bites a child?\nNone of us want to imagine that our dog could bite someone, let alone a child. Avoiding triggers and maintaining a safe distance should help to prevent any bad encounters. Still, accidents happen, and it’s important to take responsibility. If you don’t already know your local laws regarding dog bites, look them up to ensure that if a situation arises, you’ll be prepared. Also, make sure your dog is always up to date on vaccinations and required care.\nIf your dog bites someone, don’t get angry, Albright says. The damage is already done, and anger will only make the situation worse. Instead, focus on removing your dog from the situation as quickly as possible. Avoid removing your dog if they still have an active grip on the person they’ve injured, Barger warns. Pulling them away then could cause greater damage. Instead, wait for a moment, once their jaw has released.\nOnce you’ve established distance from the injured person, Craven suggests scattering treats on the ground at a safe distance from the child to calm and distract your dog. If that doesn’t work, try moving to a place where your dog cannot see the child. “Sometimes, going behind a car, garbage bin, or even into an alleyway can help break the visual contact for your dog and allow them to start calming down,” Craven says.\nIf another adult is not present, wait with the child (at a safe distance) until a caregiver arrives. If you’re alone, you might need to tether your dog away from the scared, injured person. Once an adult arrives, provide them your contact information in case they need to reach you later on.\n“Don’t try to hide things,” Albright says. “Be open. Work with that family. Offer to pay the bills. But nothing good ever comes from trying to shirk responsibility.”\nAbove all, remember that every family has a different approach to teaching their children about how to interact with dogs, and somemay not have done so at all. Not every child will understand the appropriate way to behave, so it’syourresponsibility to set the necessary boundaries and work with your dog to keep everyone safe.\nReferences:\nSocialization of Dogs and Cats\nSocialization of Dogs and Cats\nControl Unleashed Pattern Games\nControl Unleashed Pattern Games",

However, while this range gives a general idea of what’s “normal,” peeing habits vary across dog breeds and life stages. What matters most isyourdog’s baseline. Once you know what’s typical for them, you’ll be quicker to spot when something is off.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents.

Other factors, such as weather and time of day, could also make a subtle difference. Some pups are pee-once-and-done types, while others treat every tree like it’s got a stamp-your-passport policy.\nHere's how it generally breaks down:\nAdult dogs typically pee three to five times daily. However, factors such as hydration, nutrition (especially if they’re on wet food), and activity level play roles. Dogs who drink more water than usual or are highly active must pee more often.\nWell-trained adult dogs can hold their urine longer if necessary. However, regularly holding it for more than eight to 10 hours can be damaging, increasing the likelihood of urinary tract infections or bladder issues, even in healthy adult dogs.\nPuppies are walking bladders — tiny, adorable, leaky bladders. A general rule of thumb: Puppies can hold their pee for one hour per month of age, up to six months. So, athree-month-old pupmay need to go every three hours. However, frequency can also be affected by play, meal times, and naps, because most puppies need a potty break after they’ve slept.\nNighttime is a different story. Some puppies can sleep for hours but still need at least one pee break in the wee hours (pun intended).\nOlder dogs, especially those seven years and up, may need to go more frequently, particularly if they have age-related health conditions, likekidney issuesor the early stages of incontinence. They may have a more challenging time holding their urine overnight.\nIf you’re finding more “oops” puddles around the house, it may be a normal part of aging. However, a vet checkup can confirm if you should be concerned.\nWhen to see a vet for frequent or excessive urination\nIf your dog suddenly goes from three bathroom trips daily to a dozen or more, it’s a sign that something’s wrong.Frequent urination, also known as polyuria, can be a sign of underlying health problems, including:\nDiabetes\nDiabetes\nKidney disease\nKidney disease\nLiver issues\nLiver issues\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs)\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs)\nCushing’s disease\nCushing’s disease\nBladder stones\nBladder stones\nAny sudden or unexplained increase in urination frequency, especially when paired with lethargy, excessive thirst, or “accidents” indoors, is worth a vet visit. And while we’re on the topic, if your dog is straining to pee, whining while urinating, or only producing tiny drops (pollakiuria), that’s another red flag. This behavior could indicate an infection.\nWhen you take your dog to the vet for excessive peeing, the visit may start with questions like:\nHow long has this been happening?\nHow long has this been happening?\nHas your dog been drinking more water than usual?\nHas your dog been drinking more water than usual?\nAre they eating normally?\nAre they eating normally?\nHave you noticed any indoor accidents or behavior changes?\nHave you noticed any indoor accidents or behavior changes?\nYour vet may perform urinalysis (a urine test), bloodwork, or imaging like X-rays or ultrasounds to discover the cause.\nTip: Bring a fresh sample of your dog’s urine to your appointment. It saves time and helps your vet begin investigating possible health conditions. Use a clean container and collect it directly before the visit.\nReasons why your dog may be peeing a lot\nThere are a few reasons why your dog may be peeing a lot, including:\nUrinary tract infections, kidney diseases, diabetes, and hormonal imbalances (like Cushing’s) can cause increased urination. These conditions may cause your dog to drink more water, naturally leading to more peeing.\nPolyuria is the scientific term for producing more urine than usual. It’s typically linked to increased water intake or a reduced ability of the kidneys to concentrate urine. Polyuria often goes hand-in-hand with polydipsia (excessive thirst).\nIf your dog empties theirwater bowl fasterthan expected and asks to go outside more often, this is a pattern your vet needs to know about.\nPollakiuria is frequent urination in small amounts, usually a symptom of bladder inflammation or infection. Dogs with pollakiuria may squat to pee repeatedly during walks or struggle to empty their bladder fully, but only a few dribbles come out.\nThis iscommon with UTIsor bladder stones and may be accompanied by blood in the urine or apparent discomfort. Don’t ignore the symptoms. Pollakiuria needs immediate medical attention.\nTreatment for excessive peeing in dogs\nTreatment depends on the cause. UTIs may require antibiotics and time to heal, but more serious conditions, like diabetes or kidney disease, may require a long-term care plan. The latter would include medications and dietary changes.\nSuppose anxiety or behavioral factors are behind your dog’s frequent urination (yes, stress can trigger frequent urination). According to Dr. Karen Overall, a board-certified veterinary behaviorist in Pennsylvania, increased urination in dogs may reflect anxiety, especially if accidents happen primarily when the dog is left alone or during stressful events. In that case, your vet may recommend calming supplements, behavior training, or changes to your pup’s routine.\nWhatever the issue, early intervention is essential. The sooner you catch the problem, the easier it will be to treat or manage, leading to a happier, healthier dog.\nTips for regulating your dog’s pee schedule\nStick to a routine. Dogs thrive on predictability. Regular pee breaks help reinforce good habits, so take your pup outside in the morning, after meals, and before bed.\nStick to a routine. Dogs thrive on predictability.

To summarize, healthy adult dogs pee three to five times daily, while puppies and seniors need to go more often. Dogs who eat wet food and drink more water will also naturally urinate more. Knowing what’s normal for your dog and watching for sudden changes are key.\nFrequent peeing can be harmless sometimes, especially if your dog drinks more water, or it can indicate something unhealthy. If your dog’s peeing habits change suddenly, trust your gut and talk to your vet.\nDon’t be shy about asking questions or monitoring new patterns. Your dog depends on you to help them feel their best, ensuring their bathroom habits stay on track.\nReferences\nDec 02, Harriet Meyers Published:, et al. “Why Is My Dog Peeing so Much?

  },
  "page_content": "So many people are frustrated when their dogs beg at the table because this behavior detracts from an optimal dining experience. And no offense to your adorable pup, it can be unappetizing to chow down on your meal in front of a drooling dog. You may even end up eating faster, just to get through dinner so the barking or whining and puppy-dog eyes stop. Nobody needs the misery of feeling overstuffed after speed-eating.\nDogs can become frustrated, wondering if or when they will receive a special treat from you. It’s awkward to have a dog begging at the table when you have guests. Luckily, there are ways to deal with a begging dog so everybody is happy.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nIf your dog growls when you get near their food or toys, read thisright now.\nStop feeding your dog from the table.\nIt’s essential that they learn this behavior is not successful for them. If dogs come up to you at the table, and you share some food from your plate with them, do you think they will come back and try again? Of course they will. Dogs will do whatever works for them to get what they want. The simple behavior of wandering over to the table and looking up at you expectantly is definitely working for them if the result is a piece of steak or chicken.\nIn technical terms, receiving food is a positive reinforcement for the behavior of approaching the table and giving you their attention. Positive reinforcement makes the behavior more likely to occur in the future, so a dog who has benefitted from begging is a dog who will continue to beg.\nOK, let’s say you wait and wait before giving your dog any food, but finally toss them the last of your meal. Maybe you give them food only every once in a while. Unfortunately, you are reinforcing not only the begging behavior itself, but also your dog’s persistence at it. Once a dog has learned that persistence pays off, it is even more challenging to change their behavior. To put a stop to a dog’s begging, it is essential that youcompletelystop giving them food from the table, rather than do it occasionally.\nLet the games begin.\nMake sure your dog has something to do while you eat.\nIt’s helpful to offer your dog something to eat or chew on when you are eating. If mealtime predictably means a positive experience for them, they will be happy with that and less likely to try to get a bit of your meal. For this strategy to work, it’s important that your dog has something to do during your dinner and that they can count on this happening. Optionsinclude a real bone, aKong stuffed with peanut butteror other high-quality treats, a pig ear, a cow hoof, a food puzzle with great treats in it, an antler, or something similarly worthwhile from your dog’s point of view. Get in the habit of asking your dog to do something and giving the item to your dog in a spot away from the table.\nThe “something to do” can also be simply eating their own dinner, maybe out of a food puzzle so they won’t be done in 2.4 seconds. It can also be attention from someone if not everyone in the household is eating at the same time. Receiving a massage orplaying tugwill distract many dogs from what’s going on at the table. If your dog isn’t one of them, the person spending time with them while other people eat should go outside to play or to another room for petting time.\nThe first rule of thumb for you: patience.\nReframe your dog’s behavior as a “stay” in disguise.\nThink of the begging behavior, which is often so persistent, as the first step toward a perfect “stay” and gradually teach your dog to perform that staying behavior in a different place — perhaps on the other side of the room instead of right next to the dinner table, or on their dog bed. This perspective is classic dog trainer behavior, because we so frequently use a method called “shaping” to teach dogs various skills.\nShaping is teaching an individual to perform a behavior by reinforcing successive approximations of the behavior you want. With dogs for example, it’s common to shape the behavior of ringing a bell on a doorknob to be let outside. The steps that a trainer can reinforce to teach this behavior include: going into the room with the bell, going closer to the bell, looking in the direction of the bell, touching the bell, and using enough force to make the bell move even a little. Eventually, the trainer will reinforce the dog for ringing the bell.\nDog trainers are always on the lookout for behavior we can build on to get a trick (or some other desirable behavior) we want our dog to perform. A key step is recognizing that all-important first step in the series of approximations. So, a dog who lifts their paw can easily be taught to shake or wave, and a dog who likes to lie on their side can be taught to lie in the “belly-up” position because in both cases, they are already halfway there.\nAlthough begging at the table is not a desirable behavior in most people’s minds, dog trainers see it as the first step toward a “stay” in a good spot. Dogs who have the persistence and patience to remain in place at the table are performing a gorgeous “stay.” But shaping can help make it a “stay” in the spot where you (the person) prefers they stay. All that remains is to reinforce the dog for this behavior at increasing distances (starting with just a few inches away from the original location) from the table until the dog is doing it on the other side of the room or even in another room throughout the entire meal.\nWhen it gets down to it, your dog is not so much begging as they are doing a “stay” that should make any pet parent proud. You should definitely mention this toanyoneif they have the nerve to criticize the behavior of the love of your life.",

    "title": "Vancouver Is Giving Out Yellow Bandanas to Reactive Dogs to Signal Their Need for Space",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/vancouver-yellow-bandana-project-news"
  },
  "page_content": "Pet parents of reactive dogs — dogs who show an excessive or intense response to stimuli — know how tricky it can be to go on public excursions with their pets. Reactive pups need personal space, and it’s not always easy to convey that to well-intentioned strangers who want to give out chin scratches. But the Yellow Bandana Project, a new initiative by the city of Vancouver, BC, promises to help.\n“If you’ve ever walked a reactive dog, you know how hard it is to calm them down once they have been triggered,” says thecity of Vancouver’s website.So, they’re giving their residents a way to communicate their pups’ needs ahead of time. The Yellow Bandana Project helps others identify reactive dogs; when they see a pup sporting a yellow bandana, they know to keep their distance and avoid overwhelming the dog.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\n“There’s a difference between a reactive dog and an aggressive dog. I would say that’s an important distinction to make,” Kim Rosenmayer, an employee of the City of Vancouver Animal Services,explained on Global News BC.To illustrate her point, she was joined by an extremely chilled-out, sleepy Chihuahua named Lloyd, who sported a yellow bandana himself. Though Lloyd is peaceful while lying next to her on the couch, Rosenmayer explained that other young dogs and children can make him nervous. “A reactive dog will react to common stimuli that might not bother other dogs,” she said.\nTurns out, even experts have a hard time defining these terms.\nThose reactions might include undesirable behaviors like yanking on their leashes, barking, or running to hide. Sometimes dogs are easily overexcited, and sometimes they’re anxious. “Some dogs just need a little extra space,” Rosenmayer said.\nVancouver isn’t the first to try this solution. They took inspiration fromYellow Dog UK,an organization that provides resources for the pet parents of reactive dogs. On its website, Yellow Dog UK asks that people avoid approaching dogs who are wearing a yellow ribbon or bandana.\nPet parents who have their dogs licensed with the city of Vancouver can email animal.services@vancouver.ca, call 311, or stop by Animal Services to get a free yellow bandana. Rosenmayer adds that, wherever you live, any yellow bandana or ribbon can be used to spread the word about the Yellow Dog Project and help signal your own pup’s boundaries.\nThe farther the initiative spreads, the better. As it gains in popularity, it becomes a more effective signal. “When I go walking in my local park with Lloyd, I’ve been using it,” Rosenmayer said. “People are starting to recognize the signal, and they’ll leash [their off-leash dogs] up. It’s a much more pleasant kind of interaction with other dog owners.”",

  },
  "page_content": "There are many different reasons why your puppy might pee on your bed, and understanding the underlying reasons will determine how you treat the issue.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWhy is my puppy peeing on my bed?\nNot only can puppies have accidents on your bed, but adult dogs may, too. One important thing to remember is that dogs are not spiteful and do not pee on your bed to make you mad.\nFirst, you want to think about the age of your dog. Do you have a very young puppy or an older dog? If your young puppy sleeps in your bed and is not potty trained yet, they may have accidents because they can not hold their bladder or they do not yet understand how to tell you they need to go out.\nCrating your puppy at night will help prevent accidents in your bed and help develop good potty training skills. If you insist on sleeping with your puppy (who could blame you, they are so darn cute!), be sure to take your them out if you notice they got up in the middle of the night, are moving around. or seem uncomfortable. If you are a heavy sleeper, be sure to set an alarm to take your puppy out in a timely fashion to prevent night time accidents until your puppy can hold it and is potty trained.\nIf your dog is older, they may be getting to the point where they have incontinence and can no longer hold their bowels, and investing in dog diapers may be helpful in this situation.\nTips you’ll want to pay attention to.\nWhen to seek professional help\nIs this a new behavior for your dog? This may warrant a vet visit! If your dog is exhibiting unusual urinating behaviors that you have not witnessed before, they may have a urinary tract infection or something that may need to be treated with medication. It is best to reach out to your vet and make an appointment to help treat the underlying cause.\nOnce you know your dog is healthy, you may want to think about these other reasons your dog may exhibit the behavior of peeing on your bed.\nHave you changed your sheets recently? Dogs have a sensitive sense of smell, and bed sheets are heavily covered with our scent. Your dog may be marking the bed to add their smell to the space as well. If you are unsure if it was an accident or marking behavior, observe how much urine was left.\nTypically, when a dog marks, it is much less urine than an accident. If your dog marked your bed, be sure to clean it so there is no residual smell. A residual smell may cause your dog to urinate there again. Once you have cleaned and treated the accident, it’s a good idea to cover it with baking soda for a few hours or overnight. This will help absorb any leftover odors.\nFirst step: patience.\nHow to potty train a puppy\nJust like humans, dogs can be sensitive to change. Isthere a new babyin the home? Did your schedule change because of a new job? Is there loud construction going on somewhere nearby? These are all things that can cause stress to your dog. Stress can cause a dog to exhibit behaviors that they have not exhibited in the past.  Here are some ways to help them if they are stressed out.\nHave you noticed your dog pees on the bed when only a certain member of your household is present? This may be a result of submissive urinating or excited urinating. Submissive urination is a result of fear. If you have a family member who is known for scolding a dog or puppy, they may pee in submission when around that person. If this happens, try to create positive associations with that person.\nExcited urination is quite the opposite. Is there someone in your household who comes into the room at a level of 100 percent, overly exciting your dog, using all the fun baby noises, and riling the dog up? This level of excitement may cause your puppy to urinate, and if they were on your bed when that person came in, then you may be left with a soiled bed. Have a conversation with this person, and ask them to come into the area calmly, ignoring the dog for a few minutes, until they have calmed down. Excited urination may go away as your puppy can hold their bladder more.\nAs always, if the issue persists, it is best to consult a veterinarian or dog trainer to help with the undesirable behavior.\nIf anything requires patience, it’s this.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nPuppies need to go out frequently. At night, if you are a deep sleeper, be sure to set an alarm to take your puppy out in a timely fashion to prevent night time accidents.\nIf your puppy pees when you pet them, they may be experience either submissive or excited urination. Submissive urination occurs when someone they are afraid of interacts with them, while excited urination occurs when your puppy is overstimulated, and needs to be calmed down.\nIt’s important to remember that dogs aren’t spiteful, and they aren’t purposefully peeing on your bed in order to make you mad. After you dog pees in your bed, make sure to clean the area, covering it with baking soda for a few hours or overnight in order to absorb the scent.\nReferences:\nSubmissive and Excitement Urination in Dogs",

    "title": "Should You Let Your Dogs Share Bowls?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-health/can-dogs-share-bowls"
  },
  "page_content": "If you live in a household with more than one dog, you may have wondered whether you can feed your dogs simultaneously from the same bowl. (And if you haven’t wondered that, you may have just read that sentence and thought, “Wait — what?!” But believe me, it happens!)\nEven if it might seem more convenient, the truth is that using the same food bowl for multiple dogs is a bad idea for a couple different reasons. We spoke to experts about why it should be avoided, whether water bowls are different, and what you should do instead.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nFrom handmade stoneware to hand-blown glass to heavy-duty stainless steel, these are the best bowls for fine-dining dogs.\nWhy shouldn’t you feed multiple dogs from the same bowl?\n“It is definitely not a good idea to have two or more dogs eating from the same bowl,” Diana Cron, president of the Ohio Veterinary Medical Association, tells us. Dr. Cron offered a few different reasons why. First, your dogs likely have different caloric needs in order to remain healthy, and may need different portions of food. Beyond that, they may have certain medical conditions that require differenttypesof food. “Dog diets are not one-type-fits-all,” she says.\n“It may cause stress or anxiety in some dogs,” Dr. Sandra Faeh, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association, adds. “Especially less-dominant dogs and those prone to resource guarding.” And when dogs are eating from the same bowl, you have no way of knowing whether each dog is getting the portion of food he or she needs.\n“Some dogs will overeat, and shyer dogs may not get enough,” Dr. Cron says. Even if you feel like you’re watching your dogs carefully to make sure they’re both eating, it is impossible to know for sure how much each has eaten, and whether it was too much or not enough.\nAnd in addition to setting dogs up to have inefficient or unhealthy diets, sharing one bowl creates a sense of competition, and that can lead to food aggression. “The risk of food aggression is too high to take the chance,” Morgan Thomas, medical director and veterinarian at Four Paws, tells us. “Even if those dogs have never displayed that behavior previously.”\nNo longer associate feeding time with growling time.\nWhat should you do instead?\n“We always recommend that dogs are fed separately,” Dr. Cron says. Feeding them from separate bowls, and ideally in separate areas, can ensure dogs are getting equal access to their food, and it ensures that you’re giving them the specific amount of food, and type of food, that they need.\nHow do you know the right type, and right amount? Dr. Cron says you should be “feeding each dog according to their veterinarians’ recommendations for their breed, size, ideal weight, and any underlying medical conditions.”\nIf your dog drinks from puddles or splashes around in lakes, read this.\nWhat about water bowls — can dogs share those?\nI live in a household with two dogs, and although they have both separate food and water bowls, they tend to have a “whichever I’m closest to” attitude when it comes to the water situation. Luckily, this seems to be okay.\n“In general, dogs who share a home can share a water bowl,” Dr. Lori Teller, clinical professor at the School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at Texas A&M University says. “In most cases, they will be exposed to similar infectious agents, so sharing a water bowl will not have tremendous impact on that.”\nDr. Thomas adds, however, that there is always a risk that one dog will contract an illness and pass it on to other healthy pets in the house. “Then the logistical question also becomes how to avoid sharing food and water bowls at home, and consideration must be paid to that.”\nAs an additional precaution, Dr. Faeh recommends “having multiple water bowls available, especially in multi-dog households.” This ensures all dogs have consistent access to fresh water. And, of course, you should be washing the bowls with soap and hot water regularly.\nA good basic rule: It’s best to bring your own water.\nWhat about water bowls businesses leave out or shared water bowls at dog parks?\n“There are definitely concerns about drinking from a public water bowl,” Dr. Teller says. “This is of particular concern if the bowl is not cleaned regularly or if the water is left standing for extended periods of time.” Stagnant water can retain environmental contaminants, such as plant material, parasites, toxins, and more, she says. Mold or algae can grow in it, rodents can urinate in it. “If it looks like pond water, a dog should not drink from it.”\nEven in seemingly cleaner public water bowls, there is still a big risk of diseases being spread. “Kennel cough, canine papilloma virus (spread through saliva and causes warts in and around the mouth), and various bacterial diseases, such as Salmonella or E. coli, can be spread through shared water bowls,” Dr. Teller says. “Giardia can also be spread this way.”\n“I suppose even more sinisterly one could consider that an open water bowl would be an easy way for a human to even add something toxic to the water,” Dr. Thomas says. And for dogs with food allergies, she says even trace amounts of residue left behind could trigger a flare up. “For many people, the question becomes, ‘Would you let your child drink out of that bowl? Or from a public fountain?’” she says. “I think the answer more likely these days is ‘no.’”\nIdeally, guardians should carry a collapsible, portable bowl, and some fresh water with them to give to their dog. Alternatively, they can stop at a restaurant or convenience store and ask for a cup of water.",

    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/are-dogs-stubborn"
  },
  "page_content": "Note: The names of the pet parents in this story have been changed in this article to protect their privacy.\n“Come on,” says my friend Tim, to his 11-year-old Pekinese, Brisket, as we attempt to take him for a walk. Brisket is surprisingly spry for such an old dog, but he is refusing to move at the moment. “Brisket, please!” Tim pleads. “Please! Daddy doesn’t have time for this. Ugh!”\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\n“Do you have any treats?” I ask, trying to be helpful.\n“No,” he says. “He’s just like this. He’s stubborn, that’s all. Brisket, let’s go!”\nBut is that all? Perhaps there is some issue Brisket is dealing with, something he needs, that my friend isn’t aware of. Are dogs even capable of being stubborn or is the idea that they are just another example of dog anthropomorphism? Maybe it’s not Brisket who's being stubborn but my friend. After all, he reacts the same way every time Brisket stops walking, complaining at him in various degrees of distress and refusing to invest in training or try a different approach to the problem.\nSix tips and tricks to get your dog to listen to you.\nStubbornness happens for a lot of reasons.\n“‘Stubborn’ is a label we apply to dogs when they either don’t respond as expected or are taking too long to do what we want,” saysNicole Kohanski, certified dog trainer and founder ofWiggle Butt Academyin Dallas, Texas. “Why a dog behaves this way can be due to fear, confusion, or a lack of motivation.”\nMaybe Brisket didn’t like the way we were leading him on his walk. Or maybe he smelled something nearby that he wasn’t into. Maybe he thought we were going to go one way, because that’s the way Tim usually takes him, and got confused when we went another way. Maybe he just needed to begiven some treatsto motivate himduringhis walk, instead of after his walk, as is Tim’s habit.\nWhatever the case, it’s important to realize that nothing Brisket or any dog does is ever premeditated. Dogs do not plan their behaviors in advance. They do not act out of spite or hold grudges. “Dogs act in the moment and respond to the events going on around them,” says Sally Grottini, a certified therapy and service dog trainer and dog behavior expert atJustAnswer. “This is not a behavior they arechoosing; it is always the initial instinct of the dog. And calling a dog stubborn is 100 percent the owner projecting their language and impressions on the dog.”\n“My dog [Gollum] is definitely stubborn,” says another friend of mine, Fern, when I tell her I was working on this story.\n“Well, have you trained him properly,” I ask.\n“Oh no,” she says with a laugh. “He’s trained us.”\n“Except that dog’s don’t actually train people,” I say. “Their brains don’t work like that. You just haven’t put in the time and effort to train him. Well, you have, but not consciously. If he’s developed certain behavioral habits, it’s because you’ve been reinforcing them, not because he’s willful.”\n“So, it’s my fault?” she says, defensively. “Well, now you’re making me feel bad.”\nThat was certainly not my intention, but I can’t say that I was surprised by her defensiveness. Rare is the pet parent who doesn’t get at least a little defensive when they feel that they are being told that they are not doing enough for their dog. Even still, my friends know there are other dogs who don’t behave like theirs do. They know there are dogs who are better trained. But admitting that would make them feel bad about themselves, so, instead, they push the blame onto their dogs, calling them stubborn so they don’t have to take responsibility.\nIf your friends make fun of you for treating your dog like a human being, send them this.\nLabels are masking something deeper.\n“Labeling a dog as stubborn is often an easy way to shift the blame from a problem with the relationship to a problem with the dog,” saysGeorgia Welch, National Pet Training Manager atInvisible Fence® Brand.“But it’s important for pet parents to understand that when a dog fails to comply, it is more likely a failure of communication or relationship as opposed to the dog’s obstinance. For instance, a dog might fail to comply because they think the command is optional. And they think that because their training has been inconsistent.”\nAlthough I am not with Fern or Tim all the time, I’m with them enough to know that their responses to their dogs’ behavior can change drastically depending on their mood. And while this is understandable, it does result in inconsistent enforcement of cues and a wide range of reactions to certain behaviors, which I imagine must be confusing for their dogs.\nAnother consistent obstacle to dog compliance is an excess of negative reinforcement. For instance, if every time a dog is told to “come,” it is because they are in trouble and are going to get yelled at or punished, it is unlikely that they are going to want to obey that cue. Dogs, like people, have a primal need to protect themselves.\nIf your boss only called you into their office to complain about your work, you would learn to associate “Can I see you in my office?” with feeling bad. Then, every time you hear that in the future, you’ll get a sinking feeling and not want to go to that meeting. You’re a human adult, so you will probably muster up the courage to go anyway, but dogs don’t operate like that.\nItispowerful enough, even for the tough cases, and itisthe best choice—here’s why.\nKeep things positive.\nIf you want them to obey your cues, switch to positive reinforcement. Rather than sounding angry, “put a party in your voice,” as the character Rose says in Lauren Holmes’ award-winningdog-park play,Zeus IV. When they come to you, instead of yelling at them for what they were doing before you called them over, offer them a treat for complying when you did. Punishing a dogonly teaches themthat you are someone to be feared and avoided and is always more about you releasing your anger and frustration than it is about actually training your dog to do what you need them to do.\n“Often, people assume their dogs are stubborn because they don’t understand how dogs learn,” Welch says. “People are contextual learners. If you learn to read at school, you can also read at home or at the beach. But dogs are situational learners. Learning to sit at home is different from sitting at the park, which is different from sitting at the vet office. This leads to frustrations for both dogs and humans.”\n“If you find yourself getting frustrated, take some action,” Kohanski says. “Have some fun practicing the cue with your dog and pair it with lots of fun and reinforcement, like treats, praise, and pets.”\nShe adds that you can then up the motivation. Identify your dog’s motivators — like high-reward treats, physical touch and praise, or anything else they enjoy. And reward them frequently, especially when they are doing something they love.\nHere’s Kohanski’s advice: “If your dog loves being outside, but every time you call him is to bring him indoors, he may appear stubborn about recall. So, instead, try calling him from short distances within the yard, then giving him a treat or some other form of positive reinforcement, and releasing him to play some more. This will teach him that coming to you doesn’t always mean bad things and should lead to better compliance.”\nChanging your dog’s behavior is possible, but it takes time, and you won’t succeed if you’re not willing to make some changes as well. That might sound scary, but, on the upside, the kind of positive training discussed above is exactly the thing that strengthens the bond between human and dog. If you think you and your dog are close now, just wait until you two are communicating clearly and positively. The difference will be life-changing. For both of you.",

  "page_content": "If you want your lawn to be the envy of the neighborhood, your dog likely isn’t helping matters. While you don’t miss the days ofhouse training a puppy, their urine often leaves behind patchy yellow or brown spots in the grass. And unlike dog poop, you can’t just follow along behind them and clean up the mess.\nLawns and dog urine are often mortal enemies, but fortunately there are things you can do to protect your yard — and your sanity.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nWhy does dog pee kill grass?\nDog urine isrich in nitrogen, a substance which can kill grass in concentrated amounts over time. And yes, most lawn fertilizers contain nitrogen, but it’s all about moderation. A small amount of fertilizer helps keep your yard healthy; too much will kill the grass, burning it in the process.\nDogs have a tendency to pee in the same areas of a yard again and again, leading to overconcentration of nitrogen — and a lawn that looks less than stellar. If you don’t treat your grass, even with just water, it mayturn brown or yellow, or even die.\nWhat might affect urine damage to your lawn?\nYour dog might love running in your yard (or eating the grass), but the lawn may look far from healthy after regular dog urine damage. Several factors can impact how dog pee affects your yard.\nA less-processed, raw,or homemade dietcan reduce the amount of nitrogen in dog urine, limiting the damage they do to your lawn. Consider switching out your commercial kibble for wet food or using safe, hydrating fruits —like blueberries, watermelon, or cantaloupe — as treats. Make sure to consult your vet before changing your dog’s diet.\nThe more water your dog drinks, the more diluted the nitrogen in their urine will become. Plus, a healthy water intake is good for your dog’s skin, bladder, and digestive health.\nMany people believe that female dogs cause more damage to grass than male dogs, but this has more to do withhowdogs pee than their sex. Male dogs usually lift their legs and prefer to pee on things like trees and fences. Female dogs, meanwhile, tend to squat and urinate directly on the grass, causing more damage to the lawn.\nYour dog’s breed has no impact on whether their urine will harm your lawn. Some dogs may have more nitrogen in their urine, but that’s likely a result of diet or water intake, not breed.\nTips to protect your lawn from dog urine\nAs much as you love your dog, they may keep your lawn from looking green and healthy. Fortunately, there are some things you can do to prevent dog urine from killing your grass.\nMany fertilizers contain nitrogen, which is also in dog urine. The combination of both fertilizer and your dog’s pee could easily burn your lawn, so fertilize less — or not at all — in areas where your dog urinates.\nIf your grass is brown and dead in certain spots where your dog frequently urinates, consider reseeding with amore urine-resistant strain of grass, like ryegrass or fescue.\nAs with most dog-related issues, training can save the day when it comes to keeping your lawn pristine. Train your dog to eliminate in a specific area to save the rest of your yard. You can even purchase a specific grass patch for dogs to protect the rest of your yard.\nRegular wateringof the areas where your dog pees can help save dying grass in some cases. Water can dilute the urine and reduce the effects of nitrogen on your lawn.\nSpeaking of water, keeping your dog hydrated isn’t just good for their health — it’s good for your lawn, too. Encourage your pup to drink more water so the nitrogen in their urine is less concentrated, and therefore less damaging to your grass.\nDog diet supplements are available that make the nitrogen in dog urine less harmful to your grass. Always be cautious when using supplements and talk to your vet before adding anything to your dog’s diet.\nHow to get rid of dog pee spots on your lawn\nIf you want to grow grass with dogs using the yard, it’s best to prepare yourself for extra grass maintenance. When you notice dog pee spots on your lawn, make sure to water the grass where your dog has done their business for the best chance of saving your lawn.\nHere are a few other tips for getting rid of urine spots on grass:\nApply lawn treatments to the grass to remove nitrogen and salts from the soil. Be sure to use onlydog-safe treatments.\nApply lawn treatments to the grass to remove nitrogen and salts from the soil. Be sure to use onlydog-safe treatments.\nReseed any dead patches of grass.

Supplements are available that claim to reduce the nitrogen in your dog’s pee, but you should talk to your vet before giving any supplement to your dog.\nReferences\nLawn Solutions Australia\nLawn Solutions Australia\nLactic Acid is a Major Contributor to Dog Urine Injury in Cool-Season Lawn Species\nLactic Acid is a Major Contributor to Dog Urine Injury in Cool-Season Lawn Species\nLawns ‘n’ Dogs\nLawns ‘n’ Dogs",

  "page_content": "For the first month after he was adopted, Sunny spent his time in the corner of one room — where he ate, slept, peed, and generally watched the world go by. Murphy whimpered, barked, and chewed the carpet whenever she was left alone. Tucker growled and lunged at every man he encountered. Maggie was inconsolable during thunderstorms —  pacing, whining, circling, jumping in and out of the bathtub.\nAll of these dogs have one thing in common: Their behavioral problems are a result of fear. But because fear-based behavior can vary so widely — from cowering under the table when a truck roars by to lunging at and evenbiting visitors— pet parents don’t always recognize that their dogs exhibiting it are fearful.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nPer Nicole Wilde, canine behavior specialist and author ofHelp for Your Fearful Dog“There are lots of fearful dogs, but people call because of the symptoms. They rarely say, ‘I need help because my dog is fearful.’ They call because their dog is barking at visitors or shredding things.”\nHow can I tell if my dog is fearful?\nThese fear-based behaviors don’t improve until the underlying issues have been dealt with. Further, as the fear worsens, so does the problem behavior. Dr. Dan Estep, PhD and certified applied animal behaviorist (CAAB), notes that, unfortunately, early and perhaps subtle signs of fear —ears pulled back, tail tucked, avoidance — are often written off as things that all dogs do. If these signs are ignored, the signals may become more obvious and include panting and dilated pupils.\nEven then, it may be possible to distract the dog from the fear source. But, over time, fearful dogs act more intensely, become harder to distract, and then becomedestructive or reactive. Only then, when the problem is much more serious and harder to resolve, do people seek help. That’s why it’s so important to recognize the signs of fearfulness in dogs and intervenebeforethe behavior becomes more difficult to deal with.\nAccording to Dr. Estep, “fears have behavioral, physiological, and subjective components.” Some dogs flee in an attempt to avoid the stimuli that elicit fear; these dogs may hide under the bed or behind their guardian, or simply turn away from whatever it is that frightens them. The appearance of some dogs’ eyes change when they are afraid: The pupils may dilate, or more of the sclera (whites of the eyes) may be visible in an expression known as “whale eye.” This may be the result of a dog watching what frightens them by moving their eyes so they can see it without looking at it directly. Or, a dog may scan an area repeatedly in a highly vigilant manner.\nFearful dogs may also adopt telltale body postures: crouching in a lowered body position or lying down and freezing. Many dogs whine,barkor make other distress vocalizations. A fearful dog who is forced to confront or contend with what’s scaring them may become defensively aggressive while still exhibiting signs of fear.\nHow to cope with dog anxiety—from training to medication.\nDogs who are fearful often exhibit many physiological changes, as well: the sympathetic nervous system becomes aroused, which means an increase in heart rate and respiration and possibly shaking, trembling, or panting. As Dr. Estep observes, “No one of these signs by themselves is a reliable indicator of fear or any other emotional state. It’s the pattern of these things together that indicates fear.”\nBoth Dr. Estep and Wilde note that most common canine fears are related to loud or sudden noises,separation anxiety, and unfamiliar people. A fearful dog can be afraid of just about anything new, whether it’s a man in a hat, an umbrella, or a stroller.\nJust as the behavior exhibited by fearful dogs can vary, so can the reasons for the fearfulness. This may be because fear is such a common emotion. As Dr. Patricia B. McConnell, PhD, writes inFor the Love of a Dog: Understanding Emotion in You and Your Best Friend, “Surely fear must be the universal of emotions, given its importance to survival. Without it, even civilized urban dwellers wouldn’t live to pass on their genes, because they’d stroll in front of buses and forget to lock their doors at night.”\nMcConnell’s example is apt: Fear serves an important function. Without fear, it would be difficult to recognize dangers to which the appropriate reaction is critical for survival. So, fear is not itself a bad thing. It becomes a problem when individuals of any species, including dogs, are scared or skittish around so many things, or the fear is so intense, that it interferes with their enjoyment of daily life.\nDo these things to help your pup (and your guests) feel chill.\nWhy is my dog so fearful?\nWe wish we had a straight answer to this question. The reasons that dogs are fearful are exceedingly complex and very difficult to determine for an individual dog, much less for dogs in general.\nAny pup — purebred or mixed breed, male or female, young or old, rescue or from a breeder — can develop fear-based behaviors. That said, there is compelling evidence that any one of several factors can result in fearful dogs, including genetics.\nExperiments done with Pointers in the 1960s demonstrated that you can breed for fear of people in dogs.* Additionally, many dogs who are fearful have littermates or other relatives with this problem, which suggests a genetic predisposition.\nIt’s hard to tease apart the effects of early experiences and genetics. For example, an entire litter of puppies could also be fearful of people because they were raised with no opportunity to meet them;proper socializationcould have resulted in puppies without such fears.\nSocialization is indeed important: It’s critical to expose puppies to new people, places, animals, sounds, objects and anything else they are likely to encounter throughout their lives. As Dr. Estep succinctly puts it, “Positive early experiencesare critical for preventing fearfulness.” From ages three to 12 weeks, puppies are especially receptive to learning that the unfamiliar is not to be feared.\nNot all fears develop in puppyhood, however. At age eight, a Miniature Schnauzer named Maxine suddenly developed a fear of other dogs,reacting with barks, lunges, and growlswhenever a dog approached. She even reacted to her companion dog — a four-year-old Miniature Schnauzer who had been her playmate since being adopted as a puppy. I met Maxine when I was working at a dog camp and wondered if she was in pain, because sudden reactivity at an older age is consistent with thepresence of pain.\nWhen the camp veterinarian examined Maxine, she discovered inflammation along her spine and noted that she yelped when that spot was touched. A canine chiropractor treated Maxine, and once her health improved, so did her behavior. A dog who knows that it is going to hurt when dogs leap on them or roughhouse with them could react with behavior that’s intended to make the other dogs go away.\nNot surprisingly, negative experiences may also lead to fear. For example, a dog who is hit by a car may become afraid of cars. Similarly, a dog who accidentally knocks over a bunch of two-by-fours in the garage may develop a fear of any long object such as wood, brooms or shovels, or become afraid of the garage.\nCan dogs overcome their fears?\nThe good news for pet parents is that yes, dogs can overcome their fears. The bad news is that it takes a lot of work, patience, and understanding. It also requires a high level of proactivity, since these problems rarely resolve on their own. As Debbie Jacobs, animal behaviorist and author ofA Guide to Living With & Training a Fearful Dog, puts it, “Fear is an emotion and changing how a dog, or a person, feels about something is a challenge.” In most cases, professional help from a trainer or behaviorist who uses positive methods is a fundamental part of recovery.\nThere are so many misconceptions about treating fearfulness in dogs that before discussing what to do, it’s important to know what not to do. Ascribing to any of the following myths is detrimental to progress when working with a fearful dog.\nHere’s how your dog’s ears can clue you in to how they’re feeling.\nMisconceptions about fearful dogs\nExpecting a dog to “just get over it” is wishful thinking.\nThe behavior that most commonly elicits concerns of abuse in a dog’s past is that the dog is only scared of men. While it’s possible that a man has harmed the dog, fearful dogs are often more reactive to men than to women or to children, and this is particularly true of dogs whose socialization experiences were inadequate. It’s likely that men — with their larger size, deeper voices, and broader shoulders — appear more imposing to dogs.\nIt’s natural to assume that a dog who is scared of children has been teased by them, or that the only reason a dog would react badly to a broom is because of a terrifying experience with one. Yes, bad experiences sometimes lead to fear, but often, dogs are afraid of things that are new or unpredictable. So, the dog may fear children because they scream and move around in crazy ways, or they may fear brooms because he’s not used to them.\nPunishment will make the dog more fearful, and must not be used as a way to change any fear-based behavior. When bad things happen to a dog in the presence of what scares them, it makes the fear and the problem behavior worse, not better.\nIn some cases, and always under the supervision of a veterinarian,pharmacological interventionmay be appropriate, in conjunction with behavior modification and other techniques for helping fearful dogs. However, there is no magic pill that instantly cures fearfulness in dogs.\nWhen a dog refuses to get in a car or crate, resists allowing the vet to examine them, or won’t go down the steps to the basement, many people perceive their behavior as obstinate. But with fearful dogs, stubbornness is not the problem, any more than a kid standing on the high dive and refusing to jump is being mulish.\nStatus is a fact of life for many social species, but when dogs are afraid, their social standing is not the issue. Trying to fit all behavior problems under the heading of dominance does far more harm than good. Happily, more and more people recognize this perspective as outdated and counterproductive.\nCertified canine behavior consultant Pia Silvani’s comment on this common misconception is simple and to the point: “With all due respect, this does not make a bit of sense.” It is okay to reassure your dog that everything is fine in a calm and confident manner. To ignore them when they are clearly distressed is about as logical as refusing to hug your child when they wake up from a nightmare.\nThey are not going to become more fearful when they are reassured, but failing to do anything risks teaching them that you are not available when they need you most. Wilde tells her clients, “Be affectionate with your dog, but if you are overly worried, your dog will be, too. It’s fine to reassure your dog casually with an upbeat tone, but don’t coddle them with nervous energy.”\nThankfully, this is not true, but resolving a dog’s fear-based problem does take effort. As Jacobs puts it, “It’s not easy and it never happens as quickly as you’d like it to. It’s going to require more work, time and energy than you anticipated.” Many dogs recover completely, and still others improve greatly, though they may always remain on the cautious side; some situations may always be overwhelming and should be avoided.\nIf your dog loses their sh*t over anything—from a squirrel to a guest. Here are some tips to curtail that.\nSo, how can I help my fearful dog?\nPart of working with a fearful dog involves accepting that it’s hard to know how far a particular dog can go in overcoming the problem. If a pet parent expects that any dog can become happy-go-lucky, extroverted and confident, they may be disappointed in the future.\nAs Jacobs writes, “Changing our own views, beliefs, and expectations may be the first step the parent of a fearful dog needs to take.” To help a dog overcome fear, it is often most effective to combine several basic strategies.\nThe first step should be a thorough medical evaluation to determine if health problems are playing a role. Dogs who are in pain may develop fear of anything that exacerbates the pain, such as being touched, being approached by a playful dog, a leash or collar, or asport class like agility.\nOlder dogs may develop fears and phobias following physical changes, including cognitive deterioration orloss of sightor hearing. A myriad of other physical problems can be in play as well, and any underlying medical issue should be resolved.\nThis may involve being an advocate for your dog, such as stopping strangers from petting them or refusing to let a family member use power tools until you get the dog out of the house. Management of the environment is a lot of work, but it’s work that pays big dividends. Protecting a dog from exposure to situations that scare them is a great way to start, because every time a fearful dog becomes afraid, the problem is compounded.\nAnd as Jaak Panksepp, neuroscientist, psychobiologist, and author ofAffective Neuroscience: The Foundations of Human and Animal Emotions, once said, “One of the most horrible experiences of life is to be stricken by sudden terror. Another is to be continually consumed by the persistent feelings of anxiety that gnaw away at you, destroying your sense of security in the world.”\nFor dogs who are reactive to the point of snapping or biting, preventing situations in which the dog feels the need to do this is essential for the safety of others as well as for the well being of the dog.\nIt’s not going to help, and it may make the situation worse, adding yet another scary experience that confirms your pup’s belief that something is worth being afraid of. Wilde advises that we allow the dog to make the decision about approaching or avoiding a potentially scary situation.\nDeveloping your dog’s confidence can help them overcome their fearfulness because these two states of being are not compatible. Anything that allows a dog to experience success is good for their self esteem and adds to their self-assurance. Training dogs to perform behaviors on cue — standard obedience exercises, targeting, responding to their names or performing tricks — can build confidence.\nSo can getting their nourishment fromfood-reward puzzlesorfood-stuffed toys, because accessing the food is an accomplishment. Play is also a way to help dogs feel confident. Once a fearful dog is comfortable enough to happily engage in play, a positive feedback loop develops. The more they play, the more confident they are, and the more confident they are, the more they play.\nThese techniques are often the core treatment for fearful dogs. Systematic desensitization is a structured way of repeatedly exposing your dog to something that they fear, but starting at a low level so that fear is not induced. Then, gradually, during many sessions over a period of weeks, months or even years, the intensity of what frightens them is increased so that they can get used to it at each level before moving on to the next.\nScary things are made less scary by being smaller, slower, quieter, farther away or otherwise less intense. Exposing your dog to what frightens them at an intensity level that is too low to induce their fear is completely different than forcing they to confront what he fears by overdoing it and actually scaring them. (For details on these techniques, McConnell’s booklet,The Cautious Canine, is a great resource.)\nClassical counterconditioning consists of pairing up what frightens the dog with something the dog loves more than anything else; eventually, the dog realizes that the scary thing predicts the wonderful thing. If your dog fears people, then every time he sees someone, they should immediately receive atheir favorite treator highly prized toy or other item. Eventually, the dog will have a positive emotional reaction to seeing a person, because they know that something good is about to happen.\nExposing your dog to the trigger that scares them, starting at very low levels of intensity and gradually working up to more intense exposures, is most effective. In practice, desensitization and classical counterconditioning are often done together.\nSome dogs progress rapidly, but others make progress that can only be detected when viewed long-term, over years or perhaps over the dog’s entire life. No matter which pattern describes your dog, it’s important to work gradually, and as Wilde says, “go at the dog’s pace.” You must only move to more intense triggers when the dog is clearly comfortable at the previous level of exposure. Fearful dogs must be handled carefully and with endless patience.\nMost behaviorists and trainers agree that in addition to specific behavior modification, a good foundation for helping dogs overcome their fears is built from many aspects of their daily life. Good nutrition, regular exercise and predictable routines are all helpful. Other potentially calming, therapeutic techniques or alternativetherapies include massage, anxiety wraps, Bach flower essences, homeopathic remedies, acupuncture, and Traditional Chinese Medicine.\nWhether or not you believe in crystal healing, Chani Ronez’s chic, customizable, and sustainable products are designed to help treat everything from separation anxiety to joint pain to GI issues.\nHow much will my dog improve?\nAlmost all fearful dogs can improve, but the degree to which a dog overcomes their fear depends on many factors. Dr. Estep and Wilde agree that the human partner is a huge factor in the eventual outcome. Motivation is critical for success, as is an understanding of the situation and the amount of time the person is willing to commit to it. The use of gentle, positive methods is also linked with improvement. Mild fears or those of recent development have a higher likelihood of successful resolution. The dog’s genetics play a role as well; the stronger the genetic component of the dog’s fears, the harder it may be to overcome them.\nWilde sums up the basic approach to helping fearful dogs: “It takes time and patience. Always be gentle, positive and kind. Never, ever use physical force or corrections.” Jacobs echoes this advice: “Your dog’s trust in you is the most important building block in the foundation for building their confidence. Never use any type of punishment or correction which scares or intimidates your dog.”\nThough it can be gut-wrenching to watch a dog live in fear, there are also positive aspects, and that may be part of the reason why some people are drawn to fearful dogs. Wilde has a long-standing history of relating to them: “I always had an empathy for the fearful ones. I was drawn to the shaking dog in the corner.” She points out that having a fearful dog “teaches you a lot about subtleties of canine body language. You become tuned into your dog. You learn to manage things. You gain increased empathy for your dog. You expand your knowledge and patience.”\nHelping a dog who lives in fear is a common undertaking — many pet parents, knowingly or not, end up living with a dog who is afraid. To succeed in treating a fearful dog so that they can conquer their fears requires knowledge, consistent effort and extraordinary patience. It’s not easy, but it’s gratifying to see the difference in a dog who has been the beneficiary of this hard work.\nWhile it is an experience that is likely to have lows that are lower and highs that are higher than expected, many pet parents report that it is immensely rewarding to work with their dogs and help them overcome their fears. As though we needed further convincing that dogs of all types, including the fearful ones, enrich our lives!\nFinal takeaway — 10 things to remember if you have a fearful dog\nBe patient — it can take a long time for dogs to overcome their fears.\nBe patient — it can take a long time for dogs to overcome their fears.\nCommit to helping your dog by putting in the time and effort to treat their fears.\nCommit to helping your dog by putting in the time and effort to treat their fears.\nDon’t force your dog into situations that you know induce fear.\nDon’t force your dog into situations that you know induce fear.\nBe open to the variety of techniques that may help your dog conquer their fears.\nBe open to the variety of techniques that may help your dog conquer their fears.\nHandle any relevant medical issues.\nHandle any relevant medical issues.\nBe gentle, positive and kind.\nBe gentle, positive and kind.\nNever use punishment.\nNever use punishment.\nProtect your dog from scary situations.\nProtect your dog from scary situations.\nAccept that many fearful dogs never become gregarious, go-with-the-flow types.\nAccept that many fearful dogs never become gregarious, go-with-the-flow types.\nLove your dog for who they are.\nLove your dog for who they are.\nReferences:\nHelp for Your Fearful Dog\nHelp for Your Fearful Dog\nFor the Love of a Dog: Understanding Emotion in You and Your Best Friend\nFor the Love of a Dog: Understanding Emotion in You and Your Best Friend\nThe Cautious Canine\nThe Cautious Canine\nA Guide to Living With & Training a Fearful Dog\nA Guide to Living With & Training a Fearful Dog",

  },
  "page_content": "In their development, puppies go through at least two phases where they are particularly fearful, even if they haven’t previously shown signs of being scared. These are called “fear periods.” These fear periods in dogs can take pet parents off guard if they don’t know about them. If they are expecting to see fear stages in dogs, it’s easier for both the peopleandthe dogs to handle them and move past them in a way that is most beneficial to their dogs.\nKnowing that puppy fear periods are a normal part of development makes it easier to cope when your dog is suddenly scared of things that didn’t used to bother them.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWhat are puppy fear periods?\nPuppy fear periods are normal developmental stages. At this time, young dogs are more fearful than they are before orafterthese stages. Fear periods are predictable stages in puppy development during which dogs are more likely to react to people or objects in a way that tells us they are scared.\nThe triggers may be new things, as puppies are often more afraid of new things during fear periods than they are either before or after these fear periods. Puppies may also react to objects or people that never used to stress them out, like a trash can on the side of the road, a door slamming, or a person shoveling snow.\nNot all fearful dogs have been mistreated.\nPuppies have fear periods because it is advantageous for them to be cautious at certain times during their development. There are many causes of fearfulness in dogs, and lots of reasons dogs are cautious or afraid of all kinds of things. Many of the causes of fearfulness in dogs affect dogs’ development and their adult behavior.\nIf dogs have had insufficient socialization, a traumatic experience or multiple traumatic experiences, or they are genetically predisposed to fearfulness, they will need help to overcome their fears. Even if they improve a lot, they are unlikely to be as happy-go-lucky or confident as dogs whose lives were never touched by such challenges.\nFear periods are different because most dogs go through them and emerge from them without lingering fears being carried into adulthood. Puppies are more fearful and cautious at certain predictable times in their development. These milestones are associated with change in the puppy’s life when being cautious helps keep them safe.\nWhat to expect when your perfect puppy hits that unruly stage.\nThe first puppy fear period happens around the time that puppies leave their litter and their mother and begin their life in a new home. With exposure to an entirely new environment with potential unknown dangers and without their mom there to guide and protect them, a little extra caution benefits them. Similarly, the second puppy fear period happens during a time when adolescents are becoming more independent — faster and stronger, too. A little extra concern about the world, manifested as fearfulness, likely prevents them from dangers.\nThe first fear period in puppies happens when puppies are about eight to 11 weeks old (roughly two to three months in age). The second fear period occurs when dogs are in the range of six to 14 months old. This second fear period in puppies is associated with adolescence and has been called “juvenile onset shyness” by famous behaviorist and dog trainer Patricia B. McConnell, PhD. This fear stage in adolescent dogs is often more surprising to people because they have usually been living with their dog for longer and aren’t accustomed to them being fearful.\nSeeing their dog change in a manner that has them acting differently, especially when they behave less confidently than before leaves many people asking with shock, “Why is my dog anxious all of a sudden?” But both the first fear period in dogs and the second fear period in dogs are well-known fear periods that occur at predictable ages.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nPuppy fear periods usually last just a few weeks, though lasting over a month is not unusual. It’s typical for puppies in fear periods to react to things they didn’t used to care about, like trash cans on the side of the road, a skateboarder going by, or the sound of the blender when you make your morning smoothie, but still be chill about many of the ordinary events and objects they encounter in their daily life.\nIf the puppy is scared of everything or the fears last for many months, what’s going on may not be a fear period. The situation may be a dog who is more generally anxious or fearful. These dogs may need more help overcoming their fears than typical dogs who are experiencing the typical fear stage in adolescent dogs or in puppies.\nYour puppy training schedule, from eight weeks to six months. Let’s do this.\nWhat does a fearful dog look like?\nFear-based behavior can vary widely — from cowering under the table when a truck roars by to lunging at, and even biting,visitors. Many dogs whine, bark, or make other distress sounds. People don’t always recognize these actions as fearful behavior. Other signs of fearfulness in dogs are telltale body postures and visual signals including:\nCrouching in a lowered body position\nCrouching in a lowered body position\nLying down and freezing\nLying down and freezing\nTension in body or face\nTension in body or face\nMouth closed shut tightly\nMouth closed shut tightly\nPanting\nPanting\nYawning\nYawning\nTongue flicking\nTongue flicking\nPulling back the corners of their mouth\nPulling back the corners of their mouth\nDilated pupils\nDilated pupils\nActively avoiding looking at something\nActively avoiding looking at something\nShowing a half moon shape of the white of their eye (called “whale eye”)\nShowing a half moon shape of the white of their eye (called “whale eye”)\nPutting their ears back\nPutting their ears back\nTucking their tail\nTucking their tail\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nHow to help you puppy when they become fearful\nWhen your dog is spooked by something, follow these general guidelines. Getting out of the scary situation is an important part of helping them overcome their fears, but there are other tips to overcome fearfulness when puppies are going through a fear period.\nTalk in a relaxed, cheerful way to your dog, perhaps saying, “Yes, that’s a really loud truck, isn’t it? Oh, look, there it goes down the road.” Obviously, your dog won’t know what you are saying, but your normal conversational tone of voice can help your dog calm down.\nTalk in a relaxed, cheerful way to your dog, perhaps saying, “Yes, that’s a really loud truck, isn’t it? Oh, look, there it goes down the road.” Obviously, your dog won’t know what you are saying, but your normal conversational tone of voice can help your dog calm down.\nIf your dog wants to be near you, feel free to pet or play with them. You want them to come to you when they need to feel more secure. There is no need to worry that you are reinforcing your dog’s fears.

Doing so will just make them more scared, which is counterproductive. If your dog wants to get away from a ladder or a man shoveling snow, that’s fine. Sometimes, the best thing you can do is minimize their exposure to something overwhelming, even if that means turning and heading the other way. Just calmly turn and move away from what is scaring your dog so that they don’t get any more worked up. If your dog can count on you to get them out of situations that scare them, that is good for their confidence and builds their trust in you.\nDon’t force your dog to approach something they fear.

So, if your dog suddenly widens their eyes and looks nervous when they see a new person, try to have as many new people as you can toss them a treat when they are far enough away that your dog is OK with them. If traffic cones set your dog off, give them a treat or pull out a tug toy every time you see one. It’s important that it’s something the dogloves. The more you can teach them that things that spook them predict good things, the easier it will be for them to overcome their adolescent fears.\nGive your dog something they love whenever they get nervous.

It’s so useful to know this stage is temporary and completely normal.\nWithin a few weeks or a month, your dog is likely to be just as social and happy about whatever the world brings their way as they were when they were a puppy. If your puppy always found the world to be a scary place, they will most likely continue to becautious or fearfulas an adult, but they may be even more so in adolescence.\nReferences:\nUnderstanding Fear Periods in Dogs\nUnderstanding Fear Periods in Dogs\nNervous Behaviour\nNervous Behaviour",

  "page_content": "Think of your dog’s behavior like you do grammar rules. Just as the words “there,” “they’re,” and “their” sound the same but mean different things (and definitely should not be used interchangeably), your dog’s body language and communication is complex.\nFor example, whendogs growl,it isnotalways a sign of aggression; they may do so to ask something scary to back off, or they may do so while they’re having fun. Dogs pull when they are on the leash to get to a happy place as quickly as possible, or they pull to get away from a threat. They chew shoes, pillows, and toys because — well, they’re dogs. Or they chew a doorframe because they’ve been left home alone and are panicking.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWhen your dog growls, they’re expressing their emotions. A study found that you’ll likely be able to understand what they’re feeling.\nIn order to teach your dogs to do things such as walk politely rather than pull or chew an approved toy rather than a doorframe, you need to understand what your pet is trying to communicate and their emotional state. When fear and anxiety are at the root of the problem and you help your pup overcome them, the “bad” behavior goes away. Being able to tell how a dog is feeling can be challenging, so here are a few tips to get clued into what your dog’s body language is trying to tell you.\nAre they taking an aggressive stance?\nLet’s focus on what is probably the most inaccurately used adjective when it comes to describing dog behavior: “aggressive.” I’ve heard people use it when referring to a 10-week-old puppy who was playfully nipping the feet and legs of the children in the family. Most often, I hear people use it to describea barking dog. “How do you know he’s barking aggressively?,” I always ask. And the typical reply is, “Because he was barking.” Imagine if every time you spoke, someone assumed you were thinking about attacking them!\nLet’s clear up the disconnect right now between what dogs do when they’re displaying signs of aggression and what they do when they’re just being dogs.\nNo longer associate feeding time with growling time.\nSigns of Aggressive Dog Body Language\nDog communication is mostly nonverbal; they “talk” with their bodies. Here are a few dog body language signals that could possibly indicate aggressive intent (if you observe any of the following, give the dog some space, at the very least):\nForward-leaning stance\nForward-leaning stance\nStiff body\nStiff body\nTail above the horizon, possibly stiff, possibly wagging\nTail above the horizon, possibly stiff, possibly wagging\nEars up and forward (for cropped ears, look at the base of the ear)\nEars up and forward (for cropped ears, look at the base of the ear)\nWrinkles or ridges around the eyes and lips\nWrinkles or ridges around the eyes and lips\nDirect stare\nDirect stare\nRaised hackles (hair along the dog’s back)\nRaised hackles (hair along the dog’s back)\nAs you can see, when a dog is threatening aggression, his body tends to be stiff and forward. He may also bare his teeth, growl, or bark. Let’s compare this to a dog who has friendly intentions. A comfortable dog has a relaxed body that appears curved or wiggly (think puppy), soft eyes, with their tail below the horizon, often loosely wagging, ears relaxed, and mouth gently open.\nSubtle Warning Signals\nDogs have powerful jaws and teeth that can do considerable harm to others, but it’s not in their best interest to go around biting people or other dogs. Fighting uses up a lot of energy, and they can be hurt or even killed as a result of engaging in it. So, rather than attack, dogs employ a vocabulary of escalating warning signals to ask the stressor to move away: hard stare, growl, bark, snarl, snap, and bite with inhibited force (meaning, they “pull their punch” and use reduced pressure).\nIf, after all of those warnings, the threat still has not moved away, a dog might then bite with full force. It’s important to note that dogs’ warning signals are very individual; some do all of them, some do a few, some bypass them altogether and go straight to the bite.\nTwo animal behavior experts agree it’s usuallyplay fighting. Here’s how you can tell.\nBut an often overlooked factor—which could lead to aggressive behavior if ignored—is stress. It’s extremely important to know when your dog is showing signs of stress so you can remove him from the situation or help them cope with it.\nSigns of Stressed Dog Body Language\nImagine you’re walking your dog in the park and a dog you’ve never met before approaches (we’ll assume both dogs are on leash). Don’t take it as a given that your dog will want to meet the other dog. Observe the dog’s body language to determine how they’re feeling about the situation.\nPreviously open mouth suddenly closes\nPreviously open mouth suddenly closes\nEars go back\nEars go back\n“Dandruff” or dander appears\n“Dandruff” or dander appears\nTail risesabove the horizon\nTail risesabove the horizon\nYawning begins\nYawning begins\nTongue flicks as if licking their lips\nTongue flicks as if licking their lips\nTurns entirely away from the approaching dog (or averts just eyes or head)\nTurns entirely away from the approaching dog (or averts just eyes or head)\nStarts scratching or sniffing\nStarts scratching or sniffing\nLili Chin’s bookDoggie Languageillustrates how dogs communicate — beyond ear perks and tail wags.\nIf your dog displays any of these behaviors, err on the side of caution. Respect what they’re telling you, which is, “I need some space!” Move your dog out of the path of the oncoming dog and let them observe the strange dog at a stress-free distance. How will you know how far that is? Again, observe your dog and their body language will tell you. The stress behaviors will disappear, and you’ll see a noticeable softening or relaxing of their face and body.\nOne more important point to remember: Like human behavior, dog behaviors are fluid and can change in a blink of an eye. So when your dog is in a new situation, pay attention to what they are trying to tell you with their body language. With careful observation of dog body language, you can learn to “speak dog” and keep your pet safe and happy.",

    "title": "Have a Reactive Dog? These 5 Pet Stores Offer Shopping Experiences Made Just for Them",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-shopping/private-shopping-for-reactive-dogs"
  },
  "page_content": "As someone with a reactive pup, I can confirm dogs burdened with behavioral issues miss out on a ton. If they’re animal-reactive like mine, they’ll struggle or be wholly unable to make other canine friends. Of course, dog parks are completely out of the question — though thatmight be for the best. Family activities are also heavily restricted. Hiking and other outdoor adventuring must be done on off-hours, when foot traffic is minimal, or not at all.\nAir travel is completely off the table, and any vacations must be limited to secluded cabins in the woods best suited for Stephen King inspo. Even daily routines, like going for a walk, can be stressful endeavors for these poor animals, especially in more highly populated areas.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nFor pet parents with reactive dogs, seeing a sign that says “dog friendly” outside of a coffee shop or store doesn’t evoke the same level of excitement as it might for others. If anything, it only induces feelings of guilt and sadness. Whenever I read about a cool new pet-friendly restaurant in town or see dogs roaming the aisles of Home Depot, I grieve the exploration my dog will never enjoy.\nBut we reactive pet parents must remember we are not alone in these challenges. It’s a comfort reinforced by the budding trend of pet stores offering private shopping sessions for dogs who would otherwise never be able to step foot into such an establishment.\nOffering fewer treats can actually be agoodthing.\nTo be clear, the animals are not to blame.\n“It would always break my heart when someone would say, ‘Oh, I could never bring my dog into a store like this,’” remembers Cait Cassagne, owner and CEO ofSpoiled Bitch Dog Boutiquein Nesconset, New York. Inspired by pet parents who came into the shop without their dogs, Cassagne started offering private shopping sprees in-store for pups with behavioral issues. Above all, however, she wants to remind people that reactive dogs are good dogs, too. In fact, it’s sort ofthe store’s slogan.\n“Be patient and be kind with every dog and handler you see out there. If a dog is reacting just remember, they aren’t giving their handler a hard time, they are just having a hard time,” Cassagne adds.\nMadison, Wisconsin’sbad dog fridahas a similar program, and it’s rooted in the same belief that reactive dogs deserve better understanding. “They are often lacking confidence and are scared. So, positive experiences can help build that confidence. They are not bad dogs, they just need a different type of experience keeping within their comfort level,” says the store’s owner, Noel Johnson.\nIf your pup acts diabolical on walks, you are not alone. Here’s what you can do.\nIt’s a sentiment shared by behavior professionals, as well. Leigh Siegfried, founder ofOpportunity Barks Behavior Training, agrees that these dogs are merely the product of their circumstances and environment. “Traditionally, a dog that’s reactive is a dog that’s struggling with contrast and change in environments and that can be due to any number of things,” she explains.\nSiegfried notes that reactivity is often a response to being overly adrenalized, which could be from increased tension or even excitement. Not to mention, the factors of poor socialization early on or prior bad experiences. But overall, a reactive dog is usually a fearful dog. The point is, it’s certainly not something that should be held against them as they’re clearly not the ones responsible.\nWhat can be gained from these dogs going shopping?\nI understand that opinions on retail therapy are generally mixed. Sure, you probably shouldn’t have to spend money to feel better, but you also can’t put a price on happiness (or those perfect new jeans). Now, most dogs won’t comprehend the mental boost provided by indulging in a little American consumerism. They will, though, enjoy exploring new places, especially with their favorite people. When this is done in a controlled setting, like a closed store, it can be an invaluable confidence booster for reactive pups.\n“The benefits of letting dogs roam around Spoiled Bitch Dog Boutique privately create confidence in the dog and the owner. It’s very stress-free, calming, and relaxing for both the dog and the handler,” Cassagne says.\nHer declaration will come as a relief for reactive pet parents who stress over bringing their pup anywhere for fear of an incident. Anyone with a reactive dog knows the routine anxieties that develop when bringing their dog along pretty much anywhere. You worry about other dogs or people being around and whether your pet will bark or lunge at them.\nPer Siegfried, this angst can often create a bit of a vicious cycle where the dog senses your fear, which in turn, makes them more afraid. “It’s like a feedback loop where they’re stressed, the dog’s stressed, and it just sort of compounds and keeps happening,” she explains.\nFor Johnson, these sessions offer reactive dogs a rare opportunity for mental peace and security in a public setting. Speaking of the dogs she says, “They don’t get these experiences very often. It’s another type of mental stimulation that’s so important to their mental health. And a relief for the parents to not have to worry that another dog might come into the store.”\nIf your pup acts diabolical on walks, you are not alone. Here’s what you can do.\nWhat can you expect from a private shopping session?\nI get it. As a reactive pet parent, the prospect of bringing my dog into a new space is always daunting no matter the possible benefits. Thankfully, these stores go out of their way to prepare for dogs with various precautions in place. Bad dog frida only hosts their private shopping before official open hours begin.\nThey keep all doors locked and place a sign out front indicating that a private shopping experience is in session. Not to mention, Johnson assures me that the staff who run these sessions have ample experience with reactive dogs and some even work with these types of animals during their off hours.\nAt Spoiled Bitch Dog Boutique, pet parents are asked a series of questions before signing up for a session. This is to ensure that Cassagne and her employees are well-informed about the dog and their specific needs. Upon arriving for the shopping spree, dogs are brought through the back door where there is less traffic. If they’re people-reactive, Cassagne and her employees will not be seen during the session.\nMore than anything, Cassagne just wants pet parents to know that Spoiled Bitch Dog Boutique is a safe space for them and their loved ones. “They should know that they can feel comfortable coming in to shop with their dog knowing that all the doors are locked, windows are closed, and no other dogs and/or people are coming into the store while they are shopping,” she confirms.\nWith that safety in mind, let’s rundown a few places across the country that offer these programs.\nTurns out, even experts have a hard time defining these terms.\nU.S. stores offering private shopping for reactive dogs\nLet's start on the West Coast in Sacramento, California, withPaws N’ Play, which sees itself as a one-stop shop for all things dog. In addition to selling pet products at their retail boutique, the 3,300 square foot space doubles as a canine community center.\nWith dog wash stations, play areas, and training services available, Paws N’ Play brings the pet parents of Northern California together. Recently, the store introduced itsBark and Browseprogram allowing pet parents and their reactive dogs the opportunity to shop privately. This is on top of the reactive dog training sessions they host most Saturdays.\nThe second Tuesday of every month at Wagz is considered their “Reactive Dog Days,” during which pet parents in the Fort Collins, Colorado area have the option to shop privately with their pup. The store offers 15-minute windows for animals to browse aisles unbothered by the presence of other animals. They can run around sniffing toys and treats without feeling stressed or fearful, and just focus on being dogs for a bit, something Siegfried notes reactive pups often miss.\n“I’d say a challenge of any reactive dog parent is being able to find a space where their dog can be a dog in a way that actually really supports their needs,” she explains. That said, shopping sessions at Wagz are only meant for animal-reactive dogs. While no other dogs will be allowed in, staff members and pet-less customers may still be present.\nAs we continue our reactive dog-friendly loop around the States, we head to Huntersville, North Carolina, home toDog Supplies Warehouse. Earlier this year, the store started offering30-minute solo shopping sessionsfor reactive or anxious dogs. Similar to the other stores on this list, pups are free to browse the store and guilt their parents into getting them more treats than they probably need.\nOutside of these sessions, Dog Supplies Warehouse also hosts pup socializing and adoption events, as well as free nail trims. I’d argue it’s the most exciting thing to come out of North Carolina since Michael Jordan won the National Championship as a freshman.\nLong Island’s Spoiled Bitch Dog Boutique represents one of the area’s most admirable qualities: patience for those who, er, struggle with containing their emotions. For locals losing their minds in traffic or at anotherwasted Islanders, having a store that at least appreciates their pet’s behavioral issues is a welcomed luxury.\n“Responses have been overwhelmingly beautiful. I have had such kind words spoken about my store and myself which makes this experience so rewarding,” Cassagne says.\nShe specifically points to the awareness that these sessions have brought to reactive dogs and everything they go through. “Before doing these sessions, a lot of people didn’t even know what a reactive dog was. Now they are educated which is the main goal,” she adds. After making an appointment for a private session at Spoiled Bitch Dog Boutique, pets will be faced with a vast layout of exciting products. FromGrateful Dead-inspiredchew toys tocozy apparel, there’s something for dogs of all unique interests.\nAnd finally, we land back at bad dog frida in Madison, which offersprivate sessions by appointmenton weekend mornings before the store opens. While these are only open to animal-reactive dogs at the moment, Johnson promises a positive experience for all involved. “It has been so fun to give these dogs tons of love, treats, and attention during the private shopping time and so rewarding for everyone involved,” she says.\nGiving back to the community and supporting animal adoption is at the heart of bad dog frida. Outside of private shopping appointments, the store hosts plenty of other great events for rescues, including a weekly meet and greet with adoptable dogs. Johnson hopes these programs and their additional initiatives will help combat the problems, from puppy mills to irresponsible breeders, that have created pet overpopulation and caused strains on local rescues.\n“We also support The Humane Society of the U.S. and the legislation they push to try and discourage puppy mill breeding and enforce stricter punishments for animal abusers,” she adds.",

I really need to teach him self-control. We just can’t seem to ever get enough energy out, no matter how many walks or playtimes. I’m desperate! — Anna\nHey, Anna!\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nAn overexcited dog can easily overwhelm their pet parents. Besides the fact that it can make many activities challenging, it can also become a downright dangerous situation. The possibility of knocking people over, scratching,nipping, or even inadvertently head-butting someone who is bending down to greet them can make this issue a real liability.\nIf you add young children or elderly folks into the mix, a jumping dog can be an accident waiting to happen. The key is prevention. If you want to know how to train a dog not to jump on people, here are some simple tools you can use.\nWhy dogs greet by jumping\nIt might sound obvious, but dogs usually greet by jumping because they’resimply excited.Dogs are social, and jumping up togreet a personbrings them closer to the person’s face and eye-level. They may want attention and pets from the person they’re seeing. Sometimes, dogs continue jumping, because they receive a positive award — such as attention and head scratches — from the person they jump on.\nTrain your dog to stop jumping\nEven though it may be innocent, your guests might not like having a jumping dog barreling toward them. Luckily, there are ways to stop a dog from jumping.\nExercise is super important, but it’s only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to a dog who is overly energetic. Adding alternative forms of exercise, such as mental stimulation and environmental enrichment, are critical to keep the energy at bay.\nThis engages your dog in problem-solving techniques, binds anxiety/energy, and improves communication. It can be incorporated daily within your normal home routine. Consistently practicingbasic obedience cuesand incorporating those skills into your daily routine is a great way to reinforce what your dog already may know and also introduce them to some new training protocols.\nKeep the training fun and consistent. Make sure to mix it up so your dog remains interested and you keep them on their toes.\nThis can be done withinteractive feeding toyswhich engage your dog in foraging and dissecting behaviors while consuming their daily meals. Another option is playing a game of hide and seek withsome treats hiddenaround the house.Scent-tracking gamesare a lot of fun as well. There are also manygreat chew toysout there that can help your dog bind some of that anxiety and/or extra energy through rigorous chewing.\nDespite your best efforts, an over-excited dog may still go totally bonkerswhen guests arriveor if your kids start running around the house. This may take a specific approach that includes teaching self-control and implementing a management plan.\nAnd why you shouldn’t skip the longer routes.\nYour first priority should be to reinforce and practice your basic foundation skills. Make sure Bandit has a good grip on basic cues, such as “sit,” “come,” “stay,” “go to your mat,” etc. If he seems to be struggling, find abasic obedience or manners classorhire a certified professional dog trainer for some private lessons. Be sure to do your research and seek out trainers who are certified and practice positive reinforcement techniques.\nOnce Bandit has the basics down, you want to focus on teaching him how to stay calm while exciting things are happening in his environment. Start by teaching Bandit to go to a dog bed or mat on cue — choose a designated spot that he can be instructed to “go to mat.” Once he is eagerly complying, ask him for a “stay.”\nDo this several times while you slowly increase your distance as you move away from him. Slowly increase the duration of time you expect him to “stay.”  The next step is to introduce some distractions around him during his “stay.” Make sure to reward him for completing the task with a high-value food treat and positive praise.\nOnce he can go to his mat and stay for 20 to 30 seconds, add more and morechallenging distractions. Clap your hand, jump up and down, sit on the floor, sing at the top of your lungs — you get the idea. Over the course of a few weeks, you want to be able to build up to knocking at the door, ringing the doorbell,eating on the floor, running back and forth, etc., the idea being that you can help Bandit control himself by teaching him to eagerly perform an incompatible behavior and desensitizing him to excitingenvironmental triggers.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nBe consistent to have successful training\nThroughout your training journey, it’s inevitable that Bandit will get up to his old tricks and occasionally go nuclear when you are answering the door or greeting a friend while out on a walk. We will need to respond to his behavior in a way that helps him realize that we don’t appreciate it.\nDogs will always repeat behaviors that are successful to them. If jumping, barking or grabbing at clothes gets all the attention in the room directed toward him, he will see this as very fruitful. Even negative attention isstillattention.\nUtilizing time outs are an effective way to show him his hyperactive behaviors are working against him. When he exhibits these behaviors, calmly remove him from the room. In cases where you can predict a situation where you know he will get overstimulated, employ the use of a house leash which he can drag around indoors. This way the moment he jumps, you can say “too bad” and escort him to a bathroom or bedroom using the leash.\nTime-outs should be short. Fifteen or 30 seconds of isolation from the provoking stimulus will do. If he comes out all jazzed up and repeats the behavior, immediately repeat the time out steps again. He should not be able to engage in the stimulating activity until he has noticeably calmed down. Avoid yelling or being too forceful while going through this new ritual, as this will only add excitement and frustration to the situation and likely exacerbate his behavior.\nIf you are out for a walk, and he gets overzealous over someone you meet, you can remove him from the person the moment he begins his excitable behaviors. Move back by about three to five feet, redirect his behavior, and then re-approach the person when he is calm and repeat as needed. Be sure to praise and reward Bandit for appropriate behavior. It’s not enough to tell him what not to do; you need to let him know when he is doing things well.\nIt’s important to realize that while time outs can be effective, they will not be enough on their own. The training exercises should be your focus. If he can learn how to control his enthusiasm in a controlled and manageable setting, you will do much better than relying on timeouts alone. Especially in a setting where the stakes are high and you are too distracted and he is too excited.\nRemember: You are teaching, not testing. Go slow, and work at Bandit’s pace. This is going to take some time. Be patient as he already has a default behavior that he has been practicing with varied success for some time. It will be challenging for him to suddenly stop his excitable behavior and switch gears, but with knowledge, patience, and perseverance, you should see steady progress. Practice makes progress. Happy training!\nThe first rule of thumb for you: patience.\nFAQs (People Also Ask)\nWhen it comes to how to train a dog not to jump on strangers, you will need to utilize time-outs, reward appropriate behavior, and be consistent. You will want to teach your dog a “stay” command and practice with a variety of distractions.\nPhysical exercise and mental enrichment are activities that can motivate a jumping dog to stop jumping on guests.\nThere are many ways to calm an anxious or over-excited dog; check outour guide here.\nExercise and mental enrichment can cause a dog to be less overexcitable and energetic.

At least you know your pup will grow out of their biting phase.Right?\nWhile it’s completely natural for your puppy to explore the world mouth-first, it’s also understandable that you may not enjoy having your hands, clothes, and every other part of you chewed on. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to help stop puppy biting and teach your new dog how to engage with the world a little more gently.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWe askedNicole Ellis, certified animal trainer, pet lifestyle expert, and Expert Collective member, to offer a few tips on how to stop a puppy from biting.\nWhy does my puppy bite?\nUnfortunately for pet parents and other animals in the home, biting is a normal part of your puppy’s development, particularly their teething. There are a few reasons puppies bite.\nPuppies use their teeth not just during playtime and mealtime, but to learn about the world around them, a lot of which likely feels very new. Even human babies tend to put things in their mouth on first encounters, and puppies are no different. They learn about the taste and hardness of an object by investigating with their teeth.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nWhen it comes to playtime, puppies often nip at each other as part of their socialization and to encourage play — which can sometimes includenipping at your ankleswhen you walk by. Both puppies and adult dogsuse play-bitingto entice other dogs to play.\nJust like human babies,puppies chew on everything when teethingto help their brand-new teeth work through their gums. Adult dog teeth start to grow in when your pup is around 12 to 16 weeks old, so expect plenty of biting and chewing during this time.\n“Puppies could be biting as their way of playing, communicating fear or frustration, or it may feel good, such as when they are teething,” Ellis says.\nWhat are some other causes of puppy biting?\nThere are several other reasons why your puppymay bite you, the furniture, and basically everything within reach.\nOverstimulation: While less common, some puppies may bite more frequently if they’re overstimulated. A new environment is a big life change and can be a little overwhelming for your puppy to handle.\nOverstimulation: While less common, some puppies may bite more frequently if they’re overstimulated.

Invest in a wide variety of chew toys, which will come in handy when you need to redirect their biting behavior. If your puppy starts nibbling at your hand — or the rug or the couch leg — offer a toy instead. Choose puppy teething toys made of soft plastic that won’t hurt their baby teeth or their new adult teeth. And always make sure to supervise your puppy when playing with toys to make sure they don’t bite off and swallow any small pieces.\n“Make sure your dog has lots of fun things to chew on that are also engaging, like astuffed KONGor Toppl,” Ellis says. “For teething puppies, cold, frozen toys may feel really good on those sore gums.”\nWoof’s innovative fillable design will help dogs de-stress and their parents save money.\nHow do you discipline a puppy who’s biting? It can be easy to tell your puppy whatnotto do and forget to reward them for good behavior. Make sure to reward your puppy for gentle play and discourage biting by giving treats and praise when they play nicely. Praising and rewarding your puppy when they’re quiet and calm helps them learn what behaviors you want to see and can reduce unwanted behaviors.\nAny biting during playtime should always mean an immediate “game over.” If your puppy bites too hard during play, end the interaction and leave the room for a brief time-out. This teaches your growing pup that biting leads to a loss of playtime and is the opposite of fun. Stepping away from your puppy can have a much more positive effect than yelling, which can actually encourage them to bitemore.\nWhen your puppy bites, let out a high-pitched yelp to mimic the sound a littermate would make. Then, turn away and ignore the puppy briefly. Some puppies may get excited by the sound and try to play and bite more, in which case it’s better to walk away for a few minutes. However, if your puppy does back off after you yelp, make sure to reward them with praise and a treat.\nVeterinary behaviorist Dr. Valli Parthasarathy reccos the most durable dog toys for destructive players.\nAllow your puppy to play with your hand, but when they bite too hard, let out a yelp and stop playing momentarily. This helps them learn to control their bite pressure and teaches what’s known asbite inhibition— an essential part of training for puppy biting. Puppies also learn how to bite safely in play from other dogs, and shouting out “ow!” when they bite too hard can mimic these interactions.\nIt’s also a good idea to exercise your puppy regularly with daily walks or playtime outside. Exercising is a great way to provide amply physical stimulation and can help reduce problem behaviors like biting.\nJust like exercise,mental stimulationwill help keep your pup calm and fulfilled. You can utilizethings like puzzlesand training to mentally stimulate your pup.\nWhen do puppies stop biting?\nSo, when do puppies stop biting? The earlier you start training your puppy to stop biting, the better, so begin using positive reinforcement and other behavior training for dogs who bite as soon as your puppy comes home. Puppy biting usually reaches its peak during teething, which is around 12 to 13 weeks old, and in most cases, your puppy will have all their adult teeth by the time they’re seven months old.\nJust like with any other type of training, you’ll have the most success with teaching your puppy not to bite if you start out when they’re young. If you notice your puppy biting often, take the proper steps tonipthis behavior in the bud as soon as possible.\nHow to teach your pup to play nice.\nWhen it comes to training, it’s important to be consistent, as well as patient. You won’t eliminate puppy biting overnight, so focus on the small victories, like redirecting your puppy's attention to a toy. Avoid making exceptions for any biting behavior and always stop playing when your puppy bites.\nRemember that every puppy is different and comes from a different background. Your dog may pick up on bite inhibition and training immediately or may take several months to learn. Be understanding of your dog’s unique needs and learning speed, and focus on being consistent and patient.\nAnd save your skin.\nA growing puppy is more likely to be motivated by internal rewards. That means that they get a boost of positive chemicals in their body when engaging in some behaviors, like jumping, playing, and…yes, biting. During yourpuppy’s adolescence, it’s important to find appropriate outlets for their more negative urges, such astug-of-war gamesand puzzle toys that keep them mentally and physically stimulated. This is also a great time to work on learning new tricks and skills that will serve them well as they grow into an adult dog.\nWhen should I seek professional help for puppy biting?\nIf your training for puppy biting doesn’t result in any noticeable improvement after several months, especially after teething, it may be time to invest in the services of a dog behaviorist. Below are a few more reasons why you may want to seek professional help to stop puppy biting:\nAggressive behavior\nAggressive behavior\nInjury risk\nInjury risk\nFear or anxiety\nFear or anxiety\nUnpredictable behavior\nUnpredictable behavior\nMultiple behavior issues\nMultiple behavior issues\nSafety concerns\nSafety concerns\nSpecial circumstances\nSpecial circumstances\nFrustration and stress\nFrustration and stress\n“If your puppy is guarding items, growling while biting, or attempting to bite, or you think things are not improving, it may be time to hire a professional trainer,” Ellis says.\nThe most mouth-watering treats for training your pup.\nPuppy training tips\nWhile biting is a normal part of your puppy’s development, you still want to manage the behavior and ensure that it doesn’t get out of hand, so follow these tips for puppy biting. Invest in age-appropriate chew toys that you can use to redirect your puppy’s attention away from biting andneveruse verbal or physical punishment.\nSocialization is a critical part of your puppy’s education and development. Enroll your puppy in puppy classes to expose them to other dogs and puppies so they learn appropriate play behavior and bite inhibition from their peers. Inpuppy classes, your pup can learn how to read other dogs’ body language, how to play safely, and how to communicate with other dogs their age in a controlled environment.\nMake sure to be patient and consistent with your training and always reward good behavior with a treat, verbal praise, or both. Don’t force them to stop biting or punish them for biting. This will damage your relationship and won’t effectively teach them in the long run.\nConsistency is key, so be sure everyone in the house is on board with how to best train your pup not to bite. It’s a great opportunity for the whole family to bond with the pup through positive reinforcement training, too.\nIt doesn’t have to be a battle.\nFAQs (People Also Ask):\nPuppies bite toexplore the worldwith their mouths, to learn boundaries through play, and to relieve discomfort from teething. Less commonly, they may bite because of overstimulation, fear, or pain.\nChew toys, positive reinforcement training, teaching bite inhibition, and providing lots of exercise and mental stimulation can all help with curbing puppy biting. Be consistent with training and never use punishment or force.\nPuppies and adult dogs nip to initiate play. If they bite hard, you should consult a trainer about how to curb aggressive behavior.\nReferences\nPuppy Biting\nPuppy Biting\nMouthing and Biting Behaviors in Puppies\nMouthing and Biting Behaviors in Puppies\nTeaching Bite Inhibition\nTeaching Bite Inhibition\nHow to Stop Your Puppy from Biting\nHow to Stop Your Puppy from Biting\nPreventing Dog Bites: It Is Not Only about the Dog\nPreventing Dog Bites: It Is Not Only about the Dog",

  "page_content": "South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noemhas been criticized— by politicians from the right and from the left, comedians, dog trainers, animal welfare activists, and concerned citizens — for her extreme treatment of her dog. As revealed in an excerpt from her upcoming book published inThe Guardian,Noem shot her 14-month-old Wirehaired Pointer, Cricket, for behavior thatpositive reinforcementproponent dog trainer Zak Georgedescribed to CNNas “very typical adolescent behavior out of a dog that’s been bred to have endless stamina and endurance.”\nNoem writes in her new book,No Going Back: The Truth on What’s Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forwardthat she took her young dog on a pheasant hunt where she was “out of her mind with excitement, chasing all those birds and having the time of her life.”\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nLater, after Noem failed to control her dog with basic measures like putting her on a leash, the dog attacked and killed a neighbor’s chickens. Following that incident, Noem said, “I hated that dog,” called her “untrainable” and “less than worthless,” and said she knew she had to put the dog down. She then shot the dog.\nMy take: Cricket wasnotuntrainable.\nI want to do my part to make sure other dogs don’t suffer in a similar manner, and treating dogs well and fairly begins with knowledge. Just because Noem didn’t have the skills or education to train Cricket doesn’t mean she was untrainable. Nothing about her description of this dog’s behavior suggests that Cricket was unusual. Being overwhelmed with excitement, killing chickens, not listening to cues, biting someone who reaches for her, and generally being full of exuberance is all pretty typical behavior for a young dog put in the situations Noem describes.\nMy intent is not to pile on, but I can’t in good conscience keep to myself the thoughts I have about what happened. As a canine behaviorist and dog trainer specializing in working with dogs with serious behavioral problems, an important part of my work is educating people about dogs. Noem may think her behavior makes her look tough or paints her in a good light. After all, she chose to include it in the book meant to enhance her political resume, so she must consider this story about killing her dog something to campaign on.\nThe Trump VP contender is under fire for this heinous act of cruelty.\nDespite considerable backlash, she has vigorously defended her actions and has shared stories of killing other animals. In the book, she describes a goat as nasty, mean, and smelling bad. She also shot the goat after she killed Cricket. And in her response to widespread criticism,she put out a statementasserting that killing animals on a farm is standard operating procedure and that she recently had to put down three horses her family has had for over 25 years.\nPeople were right to be incredibly upset.\nThat did nothing to allay people’s horror. Colleen O’Brien, senior vice president at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)really let looseon Noem, saying in part, “Noem obviously fails to understand the vital political concepts of education, cooperation, compromise, and compassion.”\nFollowing the outcry about her behavior, Noemwrote on X, “Whether running the ranch or in politics, I have never passed on my responsibilities to anyone else to handle. Even if it’s hard and painful. I followed the law and was being a responsible parent, dog owner, and neighbor. As I explained in the book, it wasn’t easy. But often the easy way isn’t the right way.”\nI disagree that it shows Noem’s leadership style in a good light. It’s not a display of her willingness to do tough things, but rather a display of her ignorance and cruelty. Shooting Cricket reveals her to be uninformed and prone to cruelty in a fit of anger. She is someone who has much to learn. I prefer people in charge to delegate, to seek advice from experts, and always to err on the side of kindness.\nFrom her own description of the situation, she reveals that she has no understanding of dogs, and she went right from 1) “I don’t like how this dog is acting” to 2) “I hate this dog,” to 3) “She’s bad and deserves to die,” to then 4) “I am going to kill her in an inhumane manner.” Cruelty and brutality aren’t traits worth bragging about ever, let alone when seeking public office.\nReputable trainers and experienced dog people don’t assume an untrained dog will know how to behave in the high-arousal situation of a hunt, or that a bird dog will know that hunting pheasants is a desirable behavior but hunting chickens is not. Those with knowledge of training know that successfully training a dog requires skills and information, notputting a shock collaron a young dog and throwing them into situations they haven’t been trained to handle.\nOffering fewer treats can actually be agoodthing.\nGov. Noem clearly didn’t have patience or compassion for her young dog.\nAs Joan Payton of the German Wirehaired Pointer Club of America noted, “That was a puppy that had no experience, obviously no training. If you know a minuscule amount about a bird dog, you don’t take a 14-month-old-out with trained adult dogs and expect them to perform. That's not how it works.” She went on to say that Cricket was still a “baby” — a dog who wouldn’t be physically mature until reaching the age of two years and not expected to be fully trained until somewhere in the range of three to five years old.\nSome fundamental principles of successful, humane dog training include teaching dogs what you want them to do and reinforcing the behavior you want them to perform in the future. It also involves setting dogs up for success by managing the environment to encourage the behavior you do want them to do and preventing them from being able to do what you don’t want them to do. Throughout a dog’s training, a skilled trainer avoids putting a dog in any situation they can’t handle as they expand the range of situations the dog is capable of handling.\nManaging expectations is critical for progress when training a dog. We don’t expect a puppy to stay for 10 minutes without training, and we don’t expect a hunting dog to contain their excitement when put in a hunting or hunting-like situation. Ryan Busse, a Democrat running for governor in Montana, criticized Noem,noting that“anyone who has ever owned a bird dog knows how disgusting, lazy and evil this is.”\nNoem displays a lack of understanding of dogs, dog behavior, bird dogs, hunting dogs, and behavioral development, as well as what training looks like. Her first response (her reflex action) was cruelty. Commenting on her tale is a chance to educate more people. There’s a better way to train. Behavioral euthanasia — which only occurs inincredibly rare behavior circumstanceswhere all other possibilities have been exhausted — must always be humane. Expressing hateful feelings without sympathy, empathy, or compassion are not admirable traits.\nPolitical columnist and television personalityMeghan McCain understandshow harshly Noem’s behavior will be judged because of how much people love dogs, posting: “You can recover from a lot of things in politics, change the narrative etc., — but not from killing a dog.”",

  "page_content": "Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, who has previously been in the news as one of Donald Trump’stop contendersfor a vice presidential running mate, is under fire for recent admissions of animal cruelty in her soon-to-be-released political memoir. In the book,No Going Back: The Truth on What’s Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward, Noem admitted to killing a 14-month-old dog, whom she described as “untrainable.”\nNoem describes taking her hunting dog, Cricket, on a pheasant hunt,The Guardianreported. Cricket then went “out of her mind with excitement, chasing all those birds and having the time of her life.” Later, after Noem tried to control Cricket with an electronic collar, Cricket escaped and attacked a local family’s chickens, killing multiple birds. “I hated that dog,” Noem wrote. She described Cricket as “dangerous to anyone she came in contact with” and “untrainable.”\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nAfter Cricket’s behavior on the hunt, Noem took the dog to a pit and shot her. And that’s not where the acts of animal cruelty end. After killing Cricket, Noem remembered a “nasty and mean” goat her family owned — the goat smelled “disgusting, musky, rancid” and would chase Noem’s children, perThe Guardian. Noem took the goat to the pit where she’d killed Cricket; when the goat survived the first gunshot, Noem shot him again.\nIn her memoir, Noem describes this story as evidence for her readiness for politics: She’s willing to do things that are “difficult, messy, and ugly,” she wrote.\nNew York Rep. Linda Rosenthal’s new bill puts pups first.\nNoem is under serious fire for her actions.\nOn her own X (formerly known as Twitter) account,Noem respondedtoThe Guardian’s story as if it this excerpt of her memoir were nothing more than a standard piece of book promo: “If you want more real, honest, and politically INcorrect stories that’ll have the media gasping, preorderNo Going Back.”\nOthers in Noem’s own party weren’t so nonchalant. Rick Wilson, a co-founder of The Lincoln Project and the author ofEverything Trump Touches Dies, wrote on X: “Kristi Noem is trash … She killed a puppy because she was lazy at training bird dogs, not because it was a bad dog … You down old dogs, hurt dogs, and sick dogs humanely, not by shooting them and tossing them in a gravel pit. Unsporting and deliberately cruel...but she wrote this to prove the cruelty is the point.”\nRyan Busse, agubernatorialcandidate in Montana,wrote on X, “Anyone who has ever owned a bird dog knows how disgusting, lazy, and evil this is.”\nThe Democratic National Committeereleased a statementdescribing Noem’s story as “truly disturbing and horrifying.” On her Instagram, Hilary Clinton pointedlyposted a screenshotof one of her tweets from back in 2021 that read, “Don’t vote for anyone you wouldn’t trust with your dog.” Alongside it, she simply wrote, “Still true.”\nItispowerful enough, even for the tough cases, and itisthe best choice—here’s why.\nAnd criticism comes from across the political spectrum.\nThe backlash isn’t solely along party lines. Republican television personality and author Meghan McCainwrote on X, “This is not a ‘rural/ranch’ thing … ​​This story is something out of a horror movie.” In a previous version of the edited tweet,McCain addedthat “torturing animals is a trait of a serial killer.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis alsochimed in on X, inviting people to rescue dogs fromBig Dog Ranch Rescue.\nAnimal activists are weighing in, too. Sara Amundson, the president of the Humane Society Legislative Fund,released a statementstating, “These details from Governor Kristi Noem’s upcoming book demonstrate a disconnect with the 86 million American homes that have at least one beloved pet and value our relationship with them. There are so many effective and humane ways to deal with canine behavioral issues that don’t resort to such means. America has always been a brighter light for championing the way we treat our animals. And this is not that brighter light.”\nWhy it’s best to avoid these altogether.\nColleen O’Brien, the  senior vice president at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA),added her perspective, saying, “Noem obviously fails to understand the vital political concepts of education, cooperation, compromise, and compassion.”\nPaws Animal Rescue, a rescue in Kristi Noem’s state of South Dakota, posted about the idea of an “untrainable” dog on Facebook. “We haven’t met one yet,”Paws Animal Rescue wrote. “In all our years in animal rescue and the thousands of animals that have come through our door, we have yet to meet a dog that was so untrainable it deserved to be shot to death.”",

  "page_content": "I work with all kinds of dog issues in behavior and training from teaching basic skills like sit, stay, come, and high-five to dealing with dogs who have such a serious bite history that the family is wondering if they can keep them. I specialize in working with aggressive dogs, and I work exclusively with positive techniques, which often puzzles people. There is a common idea thatpositive methods workfor simple training goals but that “more powerful” techniques are necessary to change the behavior of dogs with tougher, more serious issues. By “more powerful,” people mean harsh styles of training that use punishment.\nI say again and again to people who express this view that I use positive techniques not just because they are the most kind and humane, but also because they are also the most effective. Many people are dubious, and I take great care to explain.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nLet me make my case here about why I use and advocate for the use of positive methods when working with all dogs, including those exhibiting aggression.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nPositive methods are powerful.\nBeing gentle, kind, and humane with positive methods is a powerful way — not a weak way — to influence the behavior of dogs. Positive reinforcement is at the core of positive dog training, and it works so well in all kinds of situations and for all kinds of individuals. The reinforcement (treat, toy, play, etc.) makes the desired behavior more likely, and it also changes the brain chemistry of the dog in a beneficial way. Furthermore, the anticipation of the reinforcement has an even bigger effect on the brain than actually receiving it. That means that as the dog learns the system and understands that a treat is coming, positive reinforcement becomes potentially even more powerful.\nPositive dog training is so much more than simply using positive reinforcement, though that is a huge part of it. By using this method of training, you’re helping to give dogs the tools they need to behave in an acceptable way when in a challenging situation, such as meeting a new person or dog. It is unkind to put dogs into situations they can’t handle, and it’s even more cruel to become upset with them when they inevitably exhibit undesirable behaviors.\nAn undervalued aspect of positive training involves adjusting the environment to make it harder for them to do the wrong thing and easier for them to do the right thing. When dogs do the right thing, their behavior is reinforced, which strengthens that behavior. Setting dogs up for success and reinforcing that success is a key part of positive training, and it adds to the power of the process.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nPositive methods have so many other advantages.\nIn addition to being powerful, positive training methods have lots of other advantages. They do not rely on fear or pain to influence behavior, and that allows the learning process to be an enjoyable activity you and your dog do together instead of unpleasant for both of you. Unlike other methods, positive methods are less stressful for dogs and better for their welfare.\nPositive techniques build relationships and strengthen bonds instead of compromising them because they are shared good experiences rather than scary or uncomfortable ones. Not only is that beneficial to your lives but also to the training itself. Good relationships have always been a central part of good, effective learning experiences.\nA fundamental training principle is that it is better to teach your dog what you want them to do rather than what you don’t want them to do. Punishing your dog for jumping on orbiting visitorsdoesn’t help your dog know what theyshouldbe doing in that context. It’s better and more effective to teach them to sit when greeting someone or to go get a toy and bring it to you for atug sessionwhen someone comes into the house. A useful way to remember to be positive and kind is to remind yourself a dog doesn’t need a correction to change their behavior, but they do needhelpto change it.\nDon’t let your new dogwalk you.\nSticking to positive methods with aggressive dogs is especially important.\nI believe strongly thatdogs with aggression and other behavior problems deserve our sympathy, as well as our kindness. Philosophically, I subscribe to the idea that dogs are notgivingme (or their pet parents) a hard time, they arehavinga hard time. I’m sympathetic to them, and I want to be kind to them always. That is never truer than with aggressive dogs. The majority of aggressive dogs (80 percent of my cases, for example) are behaving aggressively primarily because they are afraid. If we want them to stop behaving aggressively, we need to help them conquer their fears. Being harsh in any with them is completely counterproductive to achieving that goal.\nFor example, imagine that a dog is afraid of new people, and every time they see a new person, they bark, growl, lunge, and bite if they are close enough. If you yell at them or punish them in any way, they learn that every time a person shows up, bad things happen to them (you getting upset with them is most definitely a bad thing!), which only makes them more afraid.\nIn contrast, suppose every new person they encountertosses them treats, something to chew on, or a new toy. If this is done correctly by paying attention to a lot of details — such as the distance between the person and the dog, the order in which the dog is exposed to particular people, and the situations you choose to put the dog in — the dog learns that people are the source of happiness via food, chews, and toys.\nThey learn to be happy when they see a new person because they have been classically conditioned to associate a new person with good things that make them happy. Classical conditioning is a very powerful type of learning, and it is a very effective way to change the behavior of aggressive dogs. It is a positive technique because when done correctly, the dog is only in situations in which they can cope, and over time the scope of situations they can handle is expanded. The undesirable behavior stops because the negative emotions at the root of the problem are being avoided.\nMaking sure the training environment is a happy rather than a scary one is critical to behavioral change, and that can only be done with positive methods, not by adding fear or pain to their life. Counterintuitively to many people’s opinion, using positive methods with aggressive dogs is effective, and harsh methods cannot be successful. In fact, because I so often want to change a dog’s emotions to stop their aggressive behavior, I use play a lot when working with aggressive dogs.\nPlay can be a reinforcement, a distraction, an incompatible behavior, arelationship-building opportunity, and a way to help a dog associate good feelings with a trigger that used to scare them. Play is so powerful and despite becoming more popular as a means of behavioral change, it is still underutilized in influencing canine behavior. Think of the difference in what a dog is learning if they were to be yelled at for barking and growling at a dog passing by the window (“I hate it when dogs go by!”) versus if they were to be offered achance to play tugevery time a dog walked by the window (“I love it when dogs go by!”).\nTake it slow. This process should never feel like speed-dating.\nPositive methods work even in tough cases.\nThere is still a common sentiment out there that positive reinforcement training is worth trying, but if you have areallyserious behavior problem on your hands (such as aggression) that it probably won’t work — that it’s not strong enough for such a big task. The truth is that positive methodsarepowerful and have a host of other advantages, and that is true no matter what you want to teach a dog and what behavioral challenges are the issue.\nPositive training is not just good for basic dog training and behavior. It’s superior in general, and it’s filled with advantages that are not only true when treating aggressive dogs, but — in some cases —especiallytrue when working with aggressive dogs.\nReferences:\nThe Eye of the Trainerby Ken Ramirez\nThe Eye of the Trainerby Ken Ramirez\nDon’t Shoot the Dogby Karen Pryor\nDon’t Shoot the Dogby Karen Pryor\nTrain Your Dog Positivelyby Victoria Stilwell\nTrain Your Dog Positivelyby Victoria Stilwell\nThe Midnight Dog Walkersby Annie Phenix\nThe Midnight Dog Walkersby Annie Phenix\nTreat Everyone Like a Dogby Karen B.

  },
  "page_content": "Dogs are naturally curious and ready to explore the world around them, whether that’s through interacting with other dogs, other humans, or just literally sniffing out what’s going on. While for the most part this exploratory behavior is just that, to explore, sometimes it can veer into something that might need to be taken care of. Case in point: dogs and dirt.\nDog parents are very used to their precious pets eating something that they shouldn’t: a  food scrap on the street, something the garbage, or even dirt. But some dogs take their dirt-eating to the extreme, which may underline other issues.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nSome dogs eat dirt due to their instincts or other causes, likegastrointestinal distress, boredom, or parasites. Understand what drives your dog to eat dirt so you can address nutritional shortfalls, anxiety, lack of stimulation, or illness to curb this behavior.\n10 steps to a safe outdoor space. Landscaper not required.\nCommon reasons dogs eat dirt\nOne reason why your dog continues to eat dirt might just be an extension of natural instincts, especially if they are young. Puppies are trying to explore their environment, which includes putting things that they shouldn’t into their mouths. VeterinarianDr. Bartley Harrisonsays there are many reasons dogs might try eating dirt.\n“There are a variety of reasons that dogs can eat dirt,” he says. “Many causes are simply behavioral, especially with puppies, who try to put everything in their mouths. Dogs may also eat dirt due to anemia (a low red blood cell count) or poor absorption of nutrients from their GI tract.”\nAs Dr. Harrison mentions, many dogs might eat dirt because they are having some sort of digestive issue or nutritional deficiency. He says that the biggest cause is “anemia, which can cause an iron deficiency, would likely be the most common cause for a dog to eat dirt.” It would be worth taking your dog to the vet to get this checked out. If anemia isn’t an issue, switching a dog’s food to one with better nutrients may help or make sure they aren’tbeing underfed.\nIt could also be caused by some sort of stomach upset. Many people thinkdogs may eat grassto soothe a sour tummy, and some dogs could possibly eat dirt as a way to make themselves vomit.However, even if eating dirt gives a pup initial relief, continuing to eat dirt long-term can cause gastrointestinal problems, such as gastrointestinal blockages, consuming toxins, and abrasions to the gastrointestinal tract if there are rocks or sticks in the dirt.\nEating dirt may also make your dog more susceptible toall types of parasitesthat hang out in the soil, such as hookworms, whipworms, giardia, and others. If your dog catches one of those parasites, there could be a whole bevy of other symptoms. Dr. Harrison mentions that pica can also be associated with some types of parasites.\n“Pica has been associated with intestinal parasites in some animals,” he says. “This could be caused by blood and nutrient loss to the worms or physical discomfort and cramping in the intestines if there are a large number of worms.”\nSo,what is pica, you ask? Pica is the persistent chewing and eating of non-indigestible objects that don’t provide any nutritional value to the animal. While many only chew on those objects, some actually consume them. Pica can then cause a myriad of health issues, depending on the object.\nAs Dr. Harrison says, sometimes pica could be associated with a dog getting a parasite, but it can also be caused by underlying nutritional deficiencies or medical issues. However, there are also other reasons behind pica. For younger dogs, it could be amatter of teething— gnawing on a foreign object if an appropriate toy isn’t provided could help soothe their gums. For others, it could be a compulsive disorder, which may be caused by genetics. For some, it might just be a matter of boredom and anxiety.\nIf your dog’s dirt-eating doesn’t have any underlying medical issues, they might justneed some extra activity. That might be more exercise — whether that’s a trip to the park or a long walk. Some new toys might help stimulate a pup previously focused on dirt. It could also mean the dog needs some more social interaction whether that’s with their parent, other humans, orsome pet pals.\nFor others, it might be a sign of anxiety. Eating dirt could be a sign of separation anxiety from a dog’s parent, redirecting their stress to what they are ingesting. Carefully monitor your dog to find out what could be thesource of their stress, making sure to keep track of frequency, time, and duration. Making notes of what may be ailing your pet will better help to eliminate that behavior. Also, watch how you interact with your pet daily — see if setting boundaries with your pet may help to relieve any anxiety. If none of that works, it may be worth looking into a dog trainer to helpdogs with severe anxiety.\nSome like it hot (but not most dogs). Here are the season’s health hazards, from fleas to foxtails.\nHow to stop your dog from eating dirt\nThe first thing to do to keep your dog from eating dirt is to manage their tendencies to want to do so.Brittany Fulton, a professional dog trainer, says the most important first step is changing the dirt-eating habit.\n“First, you’ll want to break the habit that’s started,” she says. “If there is a particular location in your yard that your dog is targeting for their dirt meals, prevent access to this area.  If you cannot block the area or cover it, leash your dog each time you take them out to prevent them from returning to the crime scene.”\nBut it’s not as simple as just breaking the habit, Fulton explains. You’ve got to keep your dog from associating that area with their dirt diet: “Build a strong recall. Just as your dog gets to the patch of dirt that they typically eat, cue them away with your recall. Reward them with lots of praise and treats or play. Remember to practice the recall in a variety of low-challenge situations including other non-dirt-eating parts of the yard.”\nIf that doesn’t work, Dr. Harrison suggests aspecific type of muzzle. “The quickest way to stop a dog from eating dirt is to use a basket muzzle when they’re outside,” he says. “These types of muzzles still allow dogs to sniff and pant to their heart’s content, but make it very difficult for them to put things in their mouths.”\nHe adds that dogs with basket muzzles on shouldn’t be left outside unsupervised and also suggests getting a trainer to help curb the behavior.\nDepending on the undertaking, it might be helpful to reassess the landscaping where your dog is focusing on eating dirt. You can obstruct the area that your canine pal is attracted to or add more stimulation in the yard with toys or other dog-safe things that might help sway them from their previous preference.\nMany dogs who are consuming dirt might be lacking sodium, iron, calcium and gaining that from dirt instead. It could be worth talking to your veterinarian about food recommendations that can better provide your dog with all its proper nutrients.Dogs who are consuming dirt may be lacking in certain nutrients (especially minerals like iron) and trying to get that from dirt instead. Make sure that your dog's food has a statement saying it contains the nutrients recommended by AAFCO for a complete and balanced diet\nMaking sure there are new and fun things for your dog to do can be important in helping a pup to stop eating dirt. Fulton says that it might be helpful to treat it like a new game. “Turn the yard time or walks into a new experience. Start a new habit. Maybe you toss the ball a few times as soon as you let your dog into the backyard.”\nShe suggests adding some “Find It” games into your walk to create a new mindset. To play Find It, toss food onto the ground and say the cue. “Teach them that when you say ‘find it,’ it means there’s some food available, and they should sniff it out.”\nIs it normal for dogs to eat dirt?\nIt can be normal for a dog to eat a little bit of dirt, but as Dr. Harrison says, anything that gets excessive is something to watch out for.\n“A little bit of dirt is unlikely to cause problems for most dogs, but eating excessive amounts of dirt can result in a stomach upset, intestinal blockage, or constipation.”\nStop your dog from digging up your favorite plants with expert advice from animal behaviorist Karen London, PhD.\nWhen to visit a vet\nLike Dr. Harrison says, seeing your canine eating excessive amounts of dirt can cause health issues and is the time to take your pet pal to the veterinarian: “If you notice your dog eating dirt frequently, it’s a good idea to check in with your vet to make sure there’s no evidence of parasites, anemia, liver issues, or another systemic issue that could be causing problems.”\nFAQs (People also ask):\nA dog could be lacking nutrients when consuming dirt and may need to change their diet to food with more nutrients.\nSide effects of a dog eating dirt can range from an upset stomach, gastrointestinal issues, parasites, or other more severe health issues.\nMaking sure your pup has a diet filled with proper nutrients is a good way to curb dirt-eating.\nReferences:\nDogs and Turfgrass Interactions\nDogs and Turfgrass Interactions\nUnusual Eating Habits in Dogs and Cats\nUnusual Eating Habits in Dogs and Cats\nGrass-Eating Patterns in the Domestic Dog, Canis familiaris\nGrass-Eating Patterns in the Domestic Dog, Canis familiaris\nGetting Dirty: Does Soil Affect a Dog’s Microbiome?\nGetting Dirty: Does Soil Affect a Dog’s Microbiome?\nPica in Dogs: Overview, Owners Perception and Intestinal Perforative Obstructive Cases in Ibadan, Nigeria\nPica in Dogs: Overview, Owners Perception and Intestinal Perforative Obstructive Cases in Ibadan, Nigeria\nLink Between Foreign Body Ingestion and Behavioural Disorder in Dogs\nLink Between Foreign Body Ingestion and Behavioural Disorder in Dogs",

  "page_content": "Do you have a nibble-y little puppy? Well, that means you’re well-loved! Dogs nibble on their human parents as a sign of affection and communication learned during early socialization. It also serves as a way for dogs to explore their surroundings and learn about their role in social interactions.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWhat is the difference between a nibble and a bite?\nThe difference between a nibble and a bite can be measured in pressure. The term “bite inhibition” is used to discuss these differences in pressure. Basically, if it hurts, it’s a bite! This doesn’t necessarily reveal a dog’s intentions or motivations, though.\nWhat is the difference between nibbling and mouthing?\nAs with the difference between nibbling and biting, nibbling and mouthing differences come down to pressure. Mouthing is considered lower pressure. Mouthing often includes holding more of the object or body part(!) in their mouths as they move their jaws.\nThose little razor teeth are no fun.\nReasons your dog nibbles on you\nBecause dogs cannot speak with their humans, they must rely on other methods of communication. Your dog may nibble on you with their front teeth toinvite play, to convey a need, or to attract your attention. In any case, consider what your dog may be trying to “say” to you. Do they need water or a potty break? A “love bite” is generally preferable to a puddle of urine on the carpet.\nA relaxed, open mouth — including contact between teeth and skin — is one of many displays in play. Research shows that play in dogs is most commonlysocially motivated. Your dog may be nibbling on you because they’re exploring the possibility of a fun play session. They’re discovering what happens with their human playmate following a nibble.\nIf you’ve spent any time with a young dog or puppy, you are familiar with their desire to nibble on your hands. This is very common, because they’re using their mouths to learn more about the world around them. They’re also learning about bite inhibition, that term mentioned above. Playmates — human or dog — react strongly, often ending play when they experience a painful bite. If a puppy wants to keep playing, they need to learn to inhibit, or lower, the pressure of their bite.\nPuppies won’t have all of their adult teeth until about seven to eight months. That means that they’ll want to soothe the achesassociated with teethingfor most of their first year of life. You can help them through this tough stage by offering them frozen chew toys and by keeping lots ofchew itemsavailable.\nNaturally, nibbling on your hand can be informative for a dog. Dogs have 100-300 millionolfactory receptor cellscompared to the human’s five to six million. So, nibbling, licking, and sniffing your hands or other body parts must be a lot like rewinding and watching what your friend did that day.\nMaybe you’ve had this experience. You’re sitting in front of the TV with your dog beside you. They start to cuddle up closer to you, becoming a little more restless. This leads to nibbling your hands or arms. When a dog isn’t sure what they should or could be doing, it’s likely that they’ll want to put their mouths on something. When you’re closest, you become the target. Have somehandy optionsto direct your dog’s roaming nibbles. Chews, stuffed Kongs, or toys are great alternatives to a nibble session on your hand.\nShould I be concerned about my dog’s nibbling?\nYou should be concerned about your dog’s nibbling if it hurts you or is very frequent. It’s perfectly natural for a dog to use their mouth in both human and dog interactions. However, most dog parents would prefer that their dog communicate with them vocally or visually, not by wrapping their mouths around their parent’s hand.\nTeach your puppy new methods of communication, such as ringing bells that signify they need to go out. Instead of nibbling you to say, “I really have to pee,” your dog can ring the “potty bells.”\nShould I be concerned about my dog nibbling on people?\nWhile bite inhibition, or bite pressure, is fairly stable across a dog’s adult life, fluctuations can occur depending on your dog’s stress or excitement levels. That said, it’s ideal to help your dog interact with other humanswithoutnibbling on them.\nFor better or worse, dogs are creatures of routine, which also means that they’re prone to picking up habits. What you encourage or allow today is likely to influence future behavior. Instead of sitting around and letting your dog nibble on your friends, take your dog out for a walk or a game of fetch.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nRecognizing warning signs\nAs pet parents, it’s our responsibility to become familiar with the warning signs associated with nibbling. It’s common for humans tomisread playversus non-play signals in dogs. It’s simply a fact that dogs have teeth, and those teeth can hurt when they’re wrapped around a finger! Become familiar with dog body language. If you’re looking for inspiration, Lili Chin has been illustratingcanine body languagefor over 20 years. Chin recommends Brenda Aloff’sCanine Body Languageto get a better understanding.\nIn my profession as a dog trainer who frequently educates clients on dog signals of discomfort, one of my favorite tips is to do a comparison. What does your dog look like when they’re excited to see you come home? I’m guessing you see a loose body with fluid, wave-like motions. Now, compare that to the body language in question. If you see stiff, jerky, sharp movements, be cautious.\nBeyond reading your dog’s body language, consider the context. If you’re not actively engaged in play and your dog was just previously quite calm but begins growling or snarling, this is a warning sign. They may be guarding an item or space. They may be uncomfortable with a new person’s presence or movements. If any of these signs is combined with teeth on skin, or nibbling, you should consult with a qualified dog trainer or behaviorist.\nYour puppy is likely to grow out of nibbling, but remember that what you do with your dog today influences tomorrow. You can helpreduce nibbling and chewing behaviorsby following some basic steps.\nDon’t let your new dogwalk you.\nHow to stop your dog from nibbling on you\nKeep your dog interested in their toys by putting some of them away for a few weeks, then re-introducing them.  If your dog is in a heavy teething phase, direct them towardtoys or items to address that chewing desire.\nIf this strategy fails, it often does because the pet parent doesn’tactually interruptthe nibbling. Once you’ve marked that painful nip with a startling sound, move away from your puppy. This might require putting a barrier or door between you and your puppy for up to 30 seconds. Your immediate absence communicates that playtime ended because a playmate was hurt.\nPuppies have their own shared language, and in the midst of play, they get hurt too. They’re masters of communicating to their puppy friends that play ends when the pain starts.  Allow other dogs or puppies to educate your puppy about appropriate jaw pressure during play\nGive yourpuppy a challengeby putting their meals into afood toy. You can put your dog’s dry food into a ball or cube that spills pieces as they push it around. If you’re using a toy that holds wet food, you can still use your dry dog food by soaking it in water or in a broth, then stuffing it into a wet food toy like a Kong\nEncourage your dog to play with you while their teeth are on a tug toy or rope. This is a great way to feed their need to interact with you while meeting their nibbling needs.\nWhen you put your dog’s brain to work, less mindless nibbling occurs.  This is one of many reasons that engaging your puppy intraining activitieswill reduce mouthing and nipping.  Teach your dog somenew behavioral cues, like “spin” or  “bow, ”to share a bonding moment and add to your party tricks!\nHow to teach your pup to play nice.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nAll breeds of puppies are known for their desire and need to teethe and chew.  While many studies have examined the occurrence of bites and associated breeds, a common pitfall (among many) is accuracy in breed identification. For example, one study found that any “stocky, short-haired” animal involved in an attack was recorded as a “Pit Bull,” regardless of actual breed identification. This leads to harmful stereotypes of this breed type.\nIn short, yes and no. You should be concerned if your dog is regularly or compulsively nibbling on themselves. This could indicate allergies, pain, or parasites (like fleas and ticks). All of those issues require your attention and will probably involve a visit to your veterinarian. Chewing on their own body parts can also be a sign of anxiety.\nIf your dog is nibbling on a dog friend periodically, it’s likely not a concern. Remember, nibbling is a normal feature of dog-to-dog play.\nYou’rethe one who lives with your dog. If you strongly dislike nibbles on you or other people, interrupt the nibbling. Direct your dog to activities that you find appropriateandfill their needs. Mental engagement, exercise, and affection are necessary for your dog, and you can meet all of those needs without allowing your dog to nibble on you. If they’re very persistent with those teeth, find the perfectchew toysto help them out.",

  "page_content": "There is nothing more disturbing than your dog bounding up to you, tail wagging, with a nose covered in kitty litter; the tell-tale sign that they have been snacking on cat poop  again. There is certainly a major yuck factor for us and also some legitimate health concerns that arise if your dog is making this a regular habit. But why in theworlddo dogs eat cat poop?\nMore importantly, how do we stop them? There are many possible reasons for a dog to eat cat poop, including physical or behavioral problems that may create the urge to eat non-food items, or — even worse — they might even like the taste. Getting to the bottom of why they are doing it is an important part of finding solutions to break the habit.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWhy, oh why, is your dog eating everything they shouldn’t?\nWhat is coprophagia?\nCoprophagia is the medical term for eating poop, whether that is one’s own poop, or the poop of another animal. Yes, some dogseat their own poop, too. The reasons for this can be very similar to reasons why a dog might eat cat poop, or even wild animal poop that they find outside.\nWhen a dog is eating non-food items the generalterm for that is pica. Pica can have many different causes, some of which are related to medical problems, while others are behavioral.\nWhat to do when your dog has questionable tastes.\nReasons dogs eat cat poop\nDogs may be tempted to eat cat poop for a number of reasons. Some of the most common include:\nThis one may be the hardest to accept because to us, it is just so gross. And yet, many dogs genuinely seem attracted to the smell and/or taste.\nCertain physical conditions can lead dogs to crave non-food items or to eat things to try and soothe pain or discomfort. This is common with digestive disorders like food allergies or parasites, as well as with certain deficiencies like vitamin B12 or anemia.\nSome medical conditions and medications will also increase a dog’s appetite, making them more likely to eat non-food items, such as with diabetes, Cushing’s disease, and steroid medications. Sometimes neurologic problems can also lead dogs to eat non-food items too.\nIn other cases, dogs eat non-food items like poop due to a compulsive disorder, anxiety, and/or boredom. It is important to rule out physical problems first in order to be sure thecause is behavioral.\nIs it unhealthy for my dog to eat cat poop?\nWe can all agree that snacking on cat poop is gross, but can a dog get sick from eating cat poop? Yes, they certainly can. If the yuck factor wasn’t enough reason to deter them from eating cat poop, there are also medical reasons why they should not be devouring these cat, uh, truffles.\nSome of the most common risks include:\nParasites: There are manyintestinal parasitesthat can be transmitted from cats to dogs, especially through the feces. If your dog is eating your own cat’s poop and your cat is a strictly indoor cat that has been routinely dewormed, this is much less likely, but never a zero-risk situation. It is much more risky if they eat cat poop from stray cats outside, or from indoor/outdoor cats that are more likely to have parasites themselves.\nParasites: There are manyintestinal parasitesthat can be transmitted from cats to dogs, especially through the feces.

It is much more risky if they eat cat poop from stray cats outside, or from indoor/outdoor cats that are more likely to have parasites themselves.\nImpaction from litter: If your dog is hitting the kitty-litter buffet, you also have to worry about them ingesting cat litter, which is not digestible. It can cause digestive upset including vomiting or diarrhea. If they eat a lot of it, it can also cause intestinal blockages, orsevere constipation, known as impaction.\nImpaction from litter: If your dog is hitting the kitty-litter buffet, you also have to worry about them ingesting cat litter, which is not digestible.

If they eat a lot of it, it can also cause intestinal blockages, orsevere constipation, known as impaction.\nToxins in kitty litter: While most kitty litters are non-toxic, some may have added ingredients to control odor or absorb moisture that are not safe for your dog to eat. Be sure to double check the labeling on your cat litter and contact a pet poison hotline if you have any concerns.\nToxins in kitty litter: While most kitty litters are non-toxic, some may have added ingredients to control odor or absorb moisture that are not safe for your dog to eat. Be sure to double check the labeling on your cat litter and contact a pet poison hotline if you have any concerns.\nSadly, you usually know right away when your pup has been eating cat poop. Either you find evidence like a kitty litter mustache, or that unmistakable scent on their breath, or you notice the litter box has been tampered with and is mysteriously empty. If you don’t happen to catch them in the act, you may not always know.\nIn many cases, they won’t have any symptoms at all if they just ate a small amount. If they did contract intestinal parasites, they might not show any signs at all, or the signs may take a while to show up, such as bloating, diarrhea, or weight loss. In the extreme case where your dog ate a lot of kitty litter and has an intestinal blockage or impaction, the signs are more obvious as this is a medical emergency. They may be vomiting, not eating, straining to poop, and/or have a painful belly. In these cases, they need immediate veterinary attention.\nIt is fairly common for dogs to eat cat poop, especially when it is readily accessible in their home. If your dog is obsessively seeking it out and/or eating lots of other non-food items, this is abnormal and may be a sign of an underlying problem. It is important to speak with your vet and get to the bottom of why they are doing so.\nFirst, physical problems should be ruled out to ensure that your dog does not need medical intervention for an underlying problem. This requires a thorough work-up with your vet to test for many of the common causes of pica.\nIf your vet doesn’t discover any medical issues, your dog may be engaging in these acts due to a behavioral problem. Work with your vet and/or a behaviorist to identify these issues and create interventions to solve the problem in other ways.\nKeep your cat’s litter box out of sight — but easy to scoop.\nHow to stop dogs from eating cat poop at home\nA big part of stopping this behavior is getting to the bottom of why your dog is doing it in the first place. For this reason, working with your vet to identify any physical or behavioral problems that are leading them to eat cat poop is a very important starting point. Targeting those specific problems will be the most effective way to combat this.\nOther proactive steps you can take include:\nBe sure to keep the litter box as clean as possible to remove temptation. Clean the box daily, plus anytime you know your cat has just pooped. If there is no poop to eat, your dog can’t get into trouble.\nIf your dog cannot access the litter box, they cannot eat cat poop. Some ideas to keep your dog out may include acovered litter box, one that is confined to a closed room with just a kitty door for access, or one that is up high enough that they can’t reach it. Whatever barriers you choose, be sure that they are acceptable to your cat and that they don’t deter your cat from using the box. Cats can be sensitive about this and when deterred, they may pee and poopoutside of the box.\nThis can have multiple benefits, especially if you suspect your dog is eating cat poop for behavioral reasons. Working on training techniques to help them feel mentally engaged and to teach them what you expect can help alleviate boredom and anxiety. In addition, teaching specific cues, like “leave it,” ormat trainingyour dog will give you a way to redirect them if you catch them sniffing around the litter or on walks.\nIn addition to training, be sure to provide your dog with manyconstructive outletsfor their mental and physical energy. When people say, “a tired dog is a good dog,” that is true on so many levels. If they are getting lots ofphysical exerciseevery day and has toys, food puzzles, opportunities for socialization, and fun training sessions, they are less likely to suffer frombehavioral problems related to boredom.\nAre there supplements that can help?\nIn most cases, supplements are unnecessary and will not prevent your dog from eating cat poop. If they are eating cat poop strictly because they like it, they are bored, or have other behavioral issues, those problems can be addressed directly in many other ways.\nIf your dog has a specific medical problem that is causing them to crave non-food items, there may be specific medications or supplements that will help, however, this should only be used in consultation with your veterinarian and based on a specific diagnosis.\nA vet’s-eye-view of an all-too-common problem.\nWhen should I take my dog to the vet for eating cat poop?\nIf your dog is obsessively eating cat poop and/or other non-food items, it’s important to have a thorough work up with your vet to determine if there is an underlying medical cause for their pica. This is especially important if you notice other physical problems like vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, an insatiable appetite, or lethargy.\nIt is also important to see your vet if your dog eats a large amount of cat litter, or any other non-food items. These foreign objects can cause serious digestive problems including intestinal blockages or impactions, so it is important to seek treatment right away.\nFor dogs that have had a thorough medical work up but continue to eat non-food items frequently, it is important to also speak with your vet about behavioral interventions that can help. This may include a combination of training techniques, medications, and using abasket muzzleto keep your dog safe from ingesting dangerous objects.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nYes; dogs can get intestinal parasites, and/or bacterial infections from eating poop and kitty litter can also make them sick.\nYes. There are many intestinal parasites that can be transmitted from cats to dogs through their feces.\nTry to encourage your dog to drink water, andbrush their teethif they will tolerate it.\nYes, kitty litter can cause digestive upset, intestinal blockages, or impactions.

  "page_content": "My dog Ava can be a ball of nervous energy. Just like her mother. It’s a real “who rescued who” situation when it comes to soothing our respective anxieties. But, if it’s any consolation to fellow fretters, we are far from alone.\nNearlyone in five U.S. householdsadopted a dog or cat during the pandemic, and understandably so. Pets provide companionship, a way toease stress, a reason to put on pants and go outside. Research consistently shows thatpets can improve our mental health, and, with a25 percent global increase in depression and anxietyduring the first year of the pandemic, we’re still reeling from the impact COVID-19 has had on our collective mental health. Of course, as anyone with a dog will tell you, adopting a pet isn’t an emotional cure-all.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nTake, for example, all those people on TikTok whose pet’s anxiety is anequal match for their own. This can run the gamut from pets experiencing a new-found degree ofseparation anxietyas owners return to the office to pets who are on thesameanti-anxiety medicationas their owners. I’m convinced Ava has been conducting rigorous studies on how sad her ears must look in order for me to never leave her home alone. The results have been inconclusive as she continues to find even subtler ways to seem sad.\nSo, what’s a person to do when their emotional support dog needs emotional support of her own?\nIs every dog an emotional support dog?\nFirst, we need to differentiate between getting a dog for emotional support and a certified emotional support animal (ESA). Any pet can provide comfort, alleviate loneliness, and be cute in a way you are sure is medically beneficial. However,registering your dog as an ESAdoes require you, as the owner, to have a consultation with and a letter from a certified mental health professional. On the other hand, your potential ESA has fewer criteria to meet than a registered service animal or psychiatric service dog. ESAs don’t require the  training to perform specific tasks for people with disabilities like guiding an owner with sight loss or reminding an owner to take their medication.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nBecause there is no legal requirement for ESA training, navigating your pet’s individual behavior is crucial to actually experiencing emotional support. If your dog is experiencing high levels of anxiety, “they may not be able to serve their emotional support function at the current time until their anxiety is treated,” explains Dr. Valli Parthasarathy, PhD, DVM, DACVB.If this is the case, Dr. Parthasarathy, who is also the co-owner of and Veterinary Behavior Specialist atSynergy Veterinary Behaviorin Portland, Oregon, recommends consulting with your dog’s vet and seeking behavior training so they can meet your required needs as a certified ESA.\nIf you aren’t looking for ESA certification but are hoping your anxious dog provides some comfort and support, rest assured there are ways you can ease their anxieties and, in turn, your own.\nWhat does anxiety look like in dogs?\nDogs can “absolutely” experience anxiety, says Brett Currie, a canine public training and behavior manager at Wayside Waifs in Kansas City. In addition to more commonly-known separation anxiety,dogs can feel anxiouswhen they’re afraid, in high-stress situations, and as they age. Unfortunately, we can’t just ask our pets how they’re feeling. (And even if we could, that might still lead to acompletely different set of emotional issues.)\nDr. Parthasarathy reiterates that every dog is different, which means anxiety can look different from pet to pet. Common signs of anxiety to look out for include excessive panting, pacing, tense body posture, and piloerection (hair standing up along your pet’s back or shoulders).\nShe notes that some signs of anxiety are less obvious, like widened eyes, dilated pupils, and a lowered tail. But, just as it does among people, Dr. Parthasarathy says “the specific combination of signs will differ between [dogs] and may change depending on the situation.”\nWhile other dogs may be more confrontational, Ava is a hider. But she also hides when she pees in the house and finds a dead bug she wants to study (i.e., roll in). You know your pet best and, with time and attention, can learn to tell the difference between a nervous wag and an excited one.\nWhat do I do when I can tell my dog is anxious?\nWe know our dogs don’t live to satisfy our every whim, though sometimes it seems they think we live to serve theirs. (They’re right.) Constant pressure to perform can make anyone anxious, dogs included. Still, it’d be nice if our dogs would, you know, chill out every once in a while.\nIf you notice your dog seems more anxious than usual, “it's always a good idea to start with a visit to your vet to be sure there's nothing physically wrong that's causing stress or anxiety,” Currie recommends. “As long as their health checks out, it's important to try to identify what is causing their stress and anxiety and give them a break from it.”Even my attention-seeking Ava needs a break from being pet every once in a while. It’s rare, but it happens. If it’s possible, removing either the source of stress or your pet from the situation is the best first option, both experts say. Unfortunately, this may mean you need to give your pet some space even though your parental instinct makes you want tocarry them around in a BabyBjörn.\nHow to cope with dog anxiety—from training to medication.\nIf it isn’t possible to remove the source of stress (e.g., thunderstorms, fireworks, general existential dread), Currie suggests creating a quiet, comfortable space for your dog and providingenrichment toyslike frozen Kongs or LickiMats as helpful distractions. Dr. Parthasarathy adds that owners should also monitor how their dog’s behavior changes around other people and animals. “The more that people can learn to recognize anxiety, the sooner dogs can get help and often the better the outcomes are for treatment,” she says. For pets that experience anxiety frequently and more severely, Currie says to talk with your vet and a certified trainer about anti-anxiety medications or individualized coping skills for behavior modification.\nOK, but what ifmyanxiety is exacerbated by my dogs?\nBummer news: Studies suggest thatnervous pet owners tend to have nervous pets. Better news: Feeling anxious when your dog is experiencing anxiety is totally understandable, says Dr. Parthasarathy, adding that “the best thing to do is to try to stay calm.” That is often easier said than done, so Currie suggests finding relaxing activities you and your dog can do together. “Sometimes reading out loud to a pet, going for a walk in a quiet area, or even playing a game of fetch in the yard can help ease your pet’s anxiety, as well as your own.”\nAbove all, both Currie and Dr. Parthasarathy emphasize that it’s OK to ask for help. “It’s always okay to seek professional help if you or your pet are struggling,” Currie says. “There’s no shame in seeking help to make you and your pet more comfortable.”",

In fact, in 2021, one study found that the grumpiest pups among us may also be the smartest.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nThe Hungarian studyexamined how quickly dogs can learn based on their temperament. “People usually look at the different behaviors of dogs as completely separate phenomena and handle them as such. While I think it is important to be able to identify behaviors separately, it is as important to see their connections,” says biologist and one of the study’s authors Kata Vékony.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nBefore starting the experiment, researchers issued a questionnaire to participating pet parents to gauge their dog’s behavior. Questions were not super obvious like, “Is your dog grumpy?” or “Is your dog cheerful?”. Instead, they enlisted a series of inquiries to effectively determine each dog’s vibe. This featured questions on how pups behaved when groomed or bathed, whether theybarkedat things or situations they don’t like, or if they’ve eversnapped at or bitother dogs or people. The team then used this information to assign each animal an “irritability” score.\nWhen your dog growls, they’re expressing their emotions. A study found that you’ll likely be able to understand what they’re feeling.\nHow the Grumpy-Dog Study Worked\nAtEötvös Loránd Universityin Budapest, Vékony and her colleagues essentially tried their best to tick off every dog by presenting a favoritetreator toy in plain sight behind a V-shaped wire mesh fence. Naturally, an animal’s instinct is to head straight for the thing they want, so the test was to see how quickly they’d learn to go around the fence. The dogs were divided into three groups, starting with one  that had figure their way around the V alone. After the designated 60-second timer was up, most didn’t make it to the prize. Next, the researchers watched a group of dogs attempt the pseudo maze with assistance from their parents. To Vékony’s shock, dogs categorized as agreeable and those holding the “grumpy” label performed equally well in these groups.\n“We initially thought that dogs with more ‘smooth’ relationships with their owner would learn better from them so it was a surprise that we found no difference between dogs in learning from the owner,” Vékony explains. But the true revelation came with the third group, which went through the experiment with guidance from a stranger. What the researchers found was that the grumpy canines were significantly more successful in completing the task, in comparison to those defined as cheerful.\nThis body language is not as simple as you probably think.\n“Interestingly, it turned out that dogs that are less tolerant to being bathed or groomed or not getting things their way, in general, are also the ones who are more persistent and goal-oriented,” Vékony says, before noting that this does not mean crabbier dogs are necessarily more intelligent.\nA Grumpy Dog Is a Socially Intelligent Dog\nGiven the parameters of the study, these findings only indicate that grouchy pups are more susceptible to social learning. As she explains, “It’s not intelligence overall or problem-solving ability but specifically social learning. These dogs are sensitive and not very tolerant of unpleasant or uncomfortable social situations so it is understandable that they pay more keen attention to the actions of humans around them. And attention is a key ingredient of social learning.”\nOf course, there are a few caveats to the results. Notably, the researchers didn’t consider breed in the study. Additionally, behavioral issues, such as human or animal aggression or separation anxiety, were not factored in. Vékony confirms that to include these components, they would have needed a much larger sample size.\nTurns out, theycanexperience pretty complex emotions.\nThat being said, there is plenty to take away from the study — namely that grumpy dogs are not less good or productive. Clearly, the research shows that cranky pups can be perfectly well-behaved. And as long as you’re not trying to make them wear colorful sweaters or hang with too many upbeat characters, they’ll listen and pick up training cues quickly. Ultimately, these dogs are just comfortable with their wants and dislikes. They’re happy to pursue the things they like and avoid what they don’t. It’s something we could probably continue to learn from them.\n“After the events of the past few years, I’m surprised most people still have some of their social skills left,” Vékony says. “But as a grumpy human of a grumpy dog, I can say that sometimes we should just embrace our grumpiness.”",

  "page_content": "The harsh reality: Some dogs eat poop. No one knows for certain why dogs engage in this behavior despite our revulsion, but it is more common than you might think. There are many possible theories as to why they do it and these can be divided primarily into medical and behavioral motivations. Consistently eating non-food items isknown as pica, and specifically eating feces is called coprophagia. In general, an underlying medical condition may lead dogs to crave non-food items; this is often due to gastrointestinal disease, nutritional deficiencies, anemia, or neurological disorders.\nOther conditions can make dogs ravenously hungry to the point where they may eat anything they find; this can happen when dogs developdiabetesorCushing’s disease, or if they are taking high doses of steroids to treat other conditions. Finally, behavioral causes of pica can include anxiety, compulsive disorders, and/or boredom. Coprophagia is a very specific form of pica and while any of the above causes can be at play, it also has its own unique motivations.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nIn most cases, coprophagia tends to be more of a behavioral problem than a medical one. The majority of dogs who exhibit coprophagia are considered to have voracious appetites and live in multi-dog households. This may be related to scavenging behavior seen in stray dogs and wild dogs who are constantly looking for scraps of any kind in order to survive. Additionally, there may be a link to innate behaviors seen in wolves that do this to keep their den clean and free of feces.\nHow to get your pet to stop chewing on inedibles from clothes to couches.\nApparently, poop eating is super common in dogs\n“I wouldn’t sayalldogs eat poop but a decent amount eat poop,” says Dr. Ashley Rossman, DVM, a veterinarian atGlen Oak Dog and Cat Hospital. Astudypublished by The University of California at Davis on coprophagia found that 24 percent of dogs have tried it, while 16% eat it frequently, meaning 6 times or more.\nWorse, most dogs prefer to eat it fresh. Yuck. In fact, researchers learned that eating poop less than two days old was far more common than consuming older poop. Dogs who savor eating poop may also enjoy eating dirt, cat poop or other non-food items as well. Aprevious studyfound that dogs with anxiety disorders or oral disorders such as Picaand plant-eating were more frequently coprophagic.\nCoprophagia is defined as the act of eating feces. It does not have to be the dog’sownfeces specifically. In fact, many dogs that exhibit coprophagia will eat other dogs’ poop as well as cat poop if given the opportunity. Dogs may do this for different reasons so it is always important to rule out underlying medical causes and make sure to treat any problems effectively to resolve the urge to eat poop.\nIn most cases however, there is no underlying medical cause and therefore, nothing to fix exactly. For most dogs, this is a behavioral idiosyncrasy that does not have a clear cause. There are some associations between dogs that eat poop and other characteristics though. In the study at UC Davis, over 1,500 pet parents were surveyed about their dogs and certain correlations among the coprophagic dogs stood out. These dogs tended to live in multi-dog households with at least one other dog. They also tended to be considered “greedy eaters,” meaning very enthusiastic eaters that are not picky. Certain breeds also seemed more inclined to be coprophagic, including terriers, hounds, and Shetland Sheepdogs.\nOur room-to-room guide to get your house in dog-safe shape.\nBut why do dogs eat poop?!\nCoprophagy is a bit of a paradox because dogs can be housetrained easily due to their aversion to poop. It is also one of the reasons that someadvocate crateswhen housetraining — dogs rarely defecate where they eat or sleep. So, then why do some dogs eat their poop?\nOne theory: it’s in their DNA. Not only did the study suggest it’s a survival mechanism that dates back to our dog’s wolf ancestors some 15,000 years ago, it’s also not uncommon behavior at certain life stages even today — mother dogs will clean up after their puppies for the first few weeks of their lives, and pups themselves don’t really refine their palates until they're about nine months old.\nIt is thought that wolves would consume “fresh feces of injured or sick pack members that might be deposited in the rest areas near the den. If wolves were to remove the feces from rest areas where infective larvae from intestinal parasites would become more numerous over time, consumption is the only method available.” If this idea is correct, then poop-eating dogs might just be showing off their wolfish roots,a more imaginative and less worrisome explanation than the other options.\nOr, “some dogs will eat their own poop because they think it tastes good,” Dr. Sara Ochoa, veterinarian atWhitehouse Veterinary Hospital, says matter-of-factly. The UC Davis veterinary researchers did find some solid evidence: the habit is more common in multi-dog households, among females, and — no surprise here — pets who are considered food-greedy in general by their parents. In many parts of the world, dogs live as strays and scavenging keeps them alive. Only those that find enough to eat will survive long enough to reproduce, thus passing on these same traits to their offspring. Many dogs may have a built-in urge to scavenge and eat anything that can provide them with nutrients as a result.\nFrom bloody poop to diarrhea—all your dog’s poop problems explained.\nWhile there are no conclusive links to medical conditions, your vet should test your dog for parasites, nutritional deficiencies, or other diseases that can cause an increase in appetite, such as diabetes or Cushing’s disease. You should also consider behavioral conditions. Does your dog suffer from anxiety such as separation anxiety or other form of anxious and/or compulsive behaviors? Do they spend much of the day alone, crated, or otherwise confined? Do they get enough physical exercises and mental enrichment? Stress, anxiety, boredom, and compulsive disorders can all lead to undesirable behaviors\nDogs are smarter than we realize, and sometimes, they put together causes and effects that we don’t even realize we are linking. For example, your dog may start off spontaneously doing something you don’t like, such as barking or pawing at your lap while you are occupied with a gripping tv show, or who knows,your job. You reflexively pet your dog to redirect them, or stop what you’re doing to investigate what kind of mischief your dog has concocted. Inadvertently, you are rewarding your dog’s behavior by giving them attention even though you don’t intend to.\nWhen this pattern is repeated, dogs learn that these behaviors get your attention. While coprophagia is not a classic attention seeking behavior, it has the potential to be one since it would definitely elicit abig reactionfrom most pet parents. And that reaction can be fun and exciting to dogs and encourage them to continue with the unwanted behavior. The key to extinguishing this pattern is through a combination of ignoring the unwanted behavior while redirecting your dog to a more constructive activity that you then reward. This should also be done in combination with consistent obedience training and physical and mental enrichment so your dog knows what you want from them and has lots of positive outlets for all of their energy.\nWithout getting totally grossed out.\nCoprophagia is not typically a learned behavior, meaning that most dogs are not eating poop because they saw their friends doing it. However, dogs are social animals and they can learn from one another, for better or worse. It is important to keep this in mind in multi-dog households. If you have a dog who is exhibiting an unwanted behavior, be sure to work on constructive solutions to resolve it and also be mindful to give your other dogs plenty of attention so they don’t feel ignored. If your problem-pup is getting extra attention, treats or other rewards to help redirect their behavior, your other dogs mayexhibit signs of jealousyand/or their own attention-seeking behaviors.\nTips to stop your dog from eating poop:\nThe main priority in these cases is to search for and treat any underlying medical or behavioral conditions that are leading to this behavior. If those conditions are well-managed or cured, a dog’s urge to eat poop should be curbed. Then, you’ll want to work on diversion tactics, especially since this habit could put your dog’s health at risk. Their poop is full of bacteria, and, “other dogs’ poopmay contain parasitesthat can infect your pet,” Dr. Ochoa cautions . The best way to stop this behavior is to eliminate opportunity. Clean up any poop in the yard right away and try to avoid it when out on walks or other areas so that your dog has no opportunities to sample the goods. Dr. Ochoa explains, “it will break the cycle for a few weeks and, usually, this will stop your dog [in the long run].”\nBut let’s say you didn’t catch them in the act until they were older. Both veterinarians suggest spicy or bitter food additives designed to make your dog’s poop less palatable- apparently, that’s possible. At the very least, Dr. Ochoa explains, “it will break the cycle for a few weeks and, usually, this will stop your dog [in the long run].” You can also supplement your dog’s diet with vitamins and enzymes to ensure they’re getting a complete and balanced diet from their food…and food alone.\nWhile the focus of the UC Davis study was not on determining how to stop poop-eating pups- the results showed that behavioral management, enzymes, and taste-aversion products did little to alter the desire. The “leave it” command scored the highest rate of 4 percent. Training can be helpful so if you haven’t started, work on improving your dog’s “leave it” cue. Should all else fail, the other other option is on you- pick up your dog’s poop ASAP. Well, sh*t.\nShudder.It happens to all of us.\nMost dogs with coprophagia will stop eventually when they seem to lose interest. The best way to initiate that is to create a pause in their access to poop and if enough time passes, they will often outgrow the impulse to eat it. This means being hypervigilant about preventing your dog from having any access to poop. In addition to keeping your yard clear of poop, there are some other helpful techniques to add on including:\nLeash walks only: if your dog is quick and/or sneaky about eating poop, you may have to stick toleash walksonly for a bit. This way, you are always with your dog when they are outside. You’ll have the ability to help them navigate any potential temptations, and pick up their poop as soon as they defecate. This is a great opportunity to practice obedience skills and sneak in some extra enrichment for your pup too.\nLeash walks only: if your dog is quick and/or sneaky about eating poop, you may have to stick toleash walksonly for a bit.

Some dogs with coprophagia are so driven to eat poop that this does not always stop them from indulging, so you may need to use this in combination with other strategies.\nLeave itcue: teaching your dog to respond to the “leave it” cue is helpful for tons of situations when you need your dog to avoid things that are gross, dangerous, and/or toxic.

This can be extra helpful if you train your dog to touch a certain target right after pooping so that your dog gets into the habit of physically leaving the scene of the poop, giving you time to clean up. Be sure to provide your dog with lots of praise and treats as you work on these skills so it is fun and rewarding for your pup too.\nTarget training: This technique takes training a step beyond the ‘leave it’ cue in that it involves training your dog to touch adesignated target on cue.

  "page_content": "Outside of maybe DMX, people rarely encourage dog barking. Depending on the deepness of their vocals, a canine’s trademark woof can inspire anything from eye rolls to migraines to the most effectively timed jump scare this side of a Blumhouse production.\nOf course, there’s a good reason why pet parents are having their work, sleep, or brief moments of peace interrupted by these howls: They’re a dog’s best form of communication. It’s also why the trend of anti-bark devices has raised more than a few eyebrows in expert circles.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nThese gadgets, likethis one, work by releasing a high-pitched noise to deter dogs from barking. The idea is when you click the device, it’ll communicate to them to stop. That might seem harmless enough, but considering these devices resemble those used forultrasonic repellent on mice, it’sprobablya bad look to use them. Plus, that’s the samelogic behind shock collars.\nBarking devices can actually cause more problems.\nTrainerJennifer Malaweyadds that these tools are not only uncomfortable for our pups, but they may create a laundry list of behavioral issues. “Any time we use an unpleasant stimulus to change behavior, we risk a long list of undesirable consequences,” she explains.\nMalawey warns that new fear, anxiety, and aggression unrelated to the original barking can develop causing additional problems for your pup and wallet. “This can, of course, come with liability and further costs for veterinary and behavior professionals. Meanwhile, the dog’s emotional health and quality of life may suffer as well.”\nOffering fewer treats can actually be agoodthing.\nProponents of these tools might argue that the noise isn’t enough to warrant such concern; it’s just a means of communicating back with their animal. These pet parents could claim that they’ve witnessed firsthand that the devices are effective in causing pets to stop barking. They may even suggest that they live in a loud city or listen to a lot of screamo music so their dog is used to hearing high-pitched squeals.\nAccording to Malawey, it doesn’t really matter if the device is physically hurtful or merely irritating for dogs. Any noticeable response is cause for concern in this area. “If it causes an animal to stop doing a behavior, however, it’s actually not relevant whether it was annoying or painful or somewhere in between,” she says. “If it was uncomfortable enough to change the behavior, it comes with risk of fallout.”\nWhy it’s best to avoid these altogether.\nThese devices are unpleasant, at best, for dogs.\nCofounder ofDogboy NYCand Kinship Collective memberRobert Haussmannconfirms that pet parents should generally avoid any training method enlisting punishment onto an animal.\n“I don’t pretend to know what an animal is experiencing. It becomes clear, however, that it is unpleasant,” says. “Often times unpleasant enough to send the dog cowering away shaking.”\nOutside of the discomfort they cause, Haussmann notes that anti-bark devices are rarely effective in altering behavior long-term. He explains that for some dogs, these doodads may cause frustration or excessive fear while causing no reaction whatsoever in others. Another common response pet parents witness when using anti-bark devices is their pups simply running into another room — where the machine might not be able to pick up the sound — to do their barking.\nMalawey cautions that this action is a warning sign of a larger issue developing and reflective of the device’s overall misuse. “That dog’s reaction — running to another room — tells us that that dog found it unpleasant enough to motivate him to escape the sound. If that were my dog, I’d be very concerned by that and would discontinue use immediately,” she says.\nYoucanlive in a quiet house again.\nAnd it probably won’t work in the long run anyway.\nBeyond being potentially cruel, both experts agree that anti-bark devices won’t be effective long-term because they focus solely on the act of barking rather than what inspired it.\n“It’s important to recognize that these devices are designed to punish a symptom, not address the root cause of the symptom,” Haussmann explains. “Until the cause is addressed, the behavior will likely continue or spill over into some equivalent or more problematic behavior.“\nFor Malawey, it all comes back to the fact that dogs bark as a means of communication. It happens for a plethora of reasons, none of which should be ignored: “It’s hard to address allforms of barking with a simple button.”\nNone of this is to minimize the struggle of pet parents trying to reduce barking. Malawey admits it’s a challenge she’s dealt with with her own pups and says she’s empathetic to the process. But ultimately, barking is necessary for our dogs and their ability to express themselves and their needs.\nIt’s better to identify the cause of barking — and go from there with training.\nAccording to Malawey and Haussmann, the most effective method of curbing excessive barking is to identify and address what’s inspiring it. “The starting point is always sleuthing out whyyour dog is barking. Context matters. Are they frightened? Are they excited? Are they bored? The solution will vary depending on what’s inspiring the barking,” Malawey says.\nHaussmann adds that all dog behavior follows a similar sequence, with a cause preceding the consequence (barking). As the pro puts it, “Trying to change the consequence with punishment is a bit clumsy and can quickly drift into something inhumane.”\nInstead, he recommends zeroing in on the cause before working to change the dog’s emotional association to what is causing the barking in the first place. “For instance, if a dog barks at people passing from a window, using a gate to prevent the dog from getting to that window could be a great solution. This could be in place while you work on a behavior plan to change the dog’s perception of the people passing,” he says.\nIt’s the saddest sound in the world.\nMalawey suggests that this form of environmental management could also include visual barriers, such as using window frosting or closing the shades. She also recommends audio masking, which would involve playing music or just keeping a fan on for white noise. Routine adjustments, such as walking your dog during less busy hours and limiting their unsupervised yard access, could go a long way, too. More than anything, management will depend entirely on your pet’s specific triggers and lifestyle, Malawey explains.\nOf course,positive reinforcement trainingis always a plus for any behavioral issues or concerns. Malawey especially recommends recall training with treats for the best results. “One of my favorite ways to address it is by teaching the dog a strong recall cue, then bringing it into the barking context. One bark, they hear the recall cue, and they come running for a nice food reward. Voila! No more barking,” she says.",

  "page_content": "While some barking is normal, excessive and uncontrolled barking isn’t pleasant. In fact, it can bereallyfrustrating and disruptive. Thankfully, there are effective techniques you can implement to help quiet your boisterous pup!\nDetermine what triggers your dog’s barking and avoid or eliminate those circumstances when possible. Visual stimuli from passersby, noises, isolation, or boredom can all incite barking fits.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nAdequate outlets for physical energy and mental challenges make dogs less likely to bark from pent-up energy or frustration at under-stimulation. Up the frequency and duration of their walks, playtime, and puzzle toys.\nIf you suspect barking is due to pain or illness, have your veterinarian examine your dog immediately. Your veterinarian will help you address and treat underlying medical issues leading to vocalization due to discomfort.\nIf your pup’s barking stems from anxiety, provide calming aids like thunder shirts, pheromone diffusers, or calming melatonin treats to address the root of the reaction rather than just the symptom. Speak with your vet for additional information about treating your dog’s anxiety.\nTeach them a “quiet” command followed by a treat when your dog stops barking on cue. This command reinforces silence and gives them something more constructive to focus on instead.\nFirst, identify the reason for the barking\nTo deal with dog barking, first identify the cause. Common causes include boredom, loneliness, anxiety, fear, territoriality, and attention-seeking. Once you know the cause, you can take steps to address it. If you are having trouble dealing with the barking on your own, consult with a professional dog trainer or behaviorist.\n1. The trigger: boredom\nThe Fix: These days, most dogs who were once bred to do a certain job find domestic life boring, and barking relieves that boredom. If this is the case, the first step in how to train a dog not to bark isincreased exerciseandmental stimulation. This will refocus your dog’s mind to something more positive and help tire them out.\nOr are they just peacefully resting? Behaviorist Karen London explains how to tell the difference.\n2. The trigger: attention seeking\nThe Fix:If your dog barks to get attention, don’t reward their demands. Yelling at your dog is inadvertently rewarding them for barking, even if the communication is negative. It’s best to ignore the barking. Wait for five seconds of quiet,thenreward your dog with attention. This way, your dog learns that they get nothing from you when they bark but gets everything when they’re quiet.\n3. The trigger: excitement\nThe Fix: A dog who barks when excited (i.e., beforegoing for a walkorbeing fed) is harder to work with because your pre-departure or pre-food cues are usually highly ritualized. Again, do not reward your dog with what they want until they’re calm. For example, if the dog barking happens as soon as you go for the leash, drop the leash and sit down.\nKeep repeating this until your dog is quiet. If you successfully attach the leash, but your dog barks as soon as they get outside, immediately go back inside. This technique requires patience, but if you are diligent, your dog will quickly learn that quiet equals a walk.\n4. The trigger: anxiety/fear\nThe Fix: Dogs whosuffer from anxietywhen left alone will often bark a lot during the first 30 minutes after departure, while others continue until their person comes home. You’ll need tohire a trainerto help;separation anxietycan be a very difficult behavior to modify.\nThe beginning of puppy parenthood can be rough, but it does get better — especially when you implement this advice.\n5. The trigger: territorial/alarm\nThe Fix: If your dog barks excitedlyin the backyard, for example, immediately take them  into the house and only allow them out again when they’re quiet. Keep repeating if necessary, but never leave them in the backyard unattended. If your dog barks at other dogs or people in or outside of your home, it might be because they haven’t receivedadequate socialization, and they feel uncomfortable.\nIn general, it’s important to note that it’s normal for a dog to bark to alert their pack about anyone (or anything) approaching their space.\n6. The trigger: pain or discomfort\nThe Fix: If your pup has been romping around outside without close supervision — or say, they stepped on something sharp during a walk — you may not know that they’re injured. Excessive barking, howling or growling can be a sign that they’re hurt and in pain. Try to identify what’s bothering them and whether there’s any sort of injury. While you’re examining them, be careful because some dogs become reactive when they’re hurt. Then take them to the vet to be vet ASAP to be treated.\n7. The trigger: certain noises or smells\nThe Fix: Sometimes it might seem like your dog is barking at absolutely nothing. But their senses — especially scent and smell — are attuned differently than ours are to their surrounding environment. For example, dogs can hear high-pitched sounds we can’t, so they may be barking at something you’re unaware of.\nThey also have a super strong sense of smell, so your pup may be picking up on a scent that is undetectable to you — and they may be trying to alert you to it! Instead of ignoring them or barking back, acknowledge that you hear them.\n8. The trigger: medical conditions\nThe Fix: If you notice that your dog’s barking is accompanied by other changes in behavior — panting or pacing, for example — it may be an indication of a more serious health issue. Especially as your pup ages, they may be barking because they’re experiencing a change in hearing or vision. Or it could be a sign of some other medical condition that’s developing, so take your dog to the vet to be evaluated if the barking persists.\nContinue to train your dog to manage barking\nOnce you’ve identified the reason your dog is barking, it’s important to train them accordingly. For example, if you’ve figured out that they are barking for attention, you want to ignore it. But youdon’twant to ignore it if you suspect there’s a medical issue. Continuing to train your dog over time and being consistent with your behavioral response should fix the issue.\nPositive reinforcementis generally a successful training technique with dogs — and it can be helpful when you’re trying to get your dog to stop barking. When your pup is exhibiting the behavior that you desire (i.e., they stop barking when you cue them or they refrain from barking when they normally would), reward it with their favorite treat. Over time, they will learn thatnotbarking is better.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nIf you are having a hard time particularly with your dog around other dogs or strangers, you should get the help of a positive reinforcementprofessional dog trainer.\nMake sure your dog gets plenty of exercise during the day. Ensure they have a comfortable place to rest, you can try a calming treat or playing white noise at night, as well.\nReferences:\nExcess Barking: a More Complex Problem Than it Would Appear\nExcess Barking: a More Complex Problem Than it Would Appear\nBarking in Family Dogs: an Ethological Approach\nBarking in Family Dogs: an Ethological Approach\nBarking in Domestic Dogs: Context Specificity and Individual Identification\nBarking in Domestic Dogs: Context Specificity and Individual Identification\nAcoustic Parameters of Dog Barks Carry Emotional Information For Humans\nAcoustic Parameters of Dog Barks Carry Emotional Information For Humans\nNoise in Dog Kennelling: is Barking a Welfare Problem For Dogs?\nNoise in Dog Kennelling: is Barking a Welfare Problem For Dogs?\nAssessment and Treatment of Excessive Barking in the Domestic Dog\nAssessment and Treatment of Excessive Barking in the Domestic Dog\nHow to Tell if Your Dog is in Pain\nHow to Tell if Your Dog is in Pain\nWhy Does My Dog Bark at Nothing?\nWhy Does My Dog Bark at Nothing?\nDecoding Your Dog’s Excessive Barking\nDecoding Your Dog’s Excessive Barking\nBarking in Dogs\nBarking in Dogs",

  "page_content": "My dog, Moose, has zero table manners. Recently, his etiquette has gotten so much worse — now his favorite thing to do is vacuum up anywhere from 20 to 400 pieces of kibble and then unhinge his jaw and release them all onto my kitchen floor. From there, he will approach every single piece of kibble with an investigative delight before eating each one individually — a meticulous process that can take upwards of 15 minutes. His commitment to the bit was honestly impressive, but I was getting sick of constantly wiping up the subsequent film of super slimy dog saliva off my floorboards.\nI finally decided there must be a better way. I did some research and found that dogs actually benefit from themental stimulationthat comes from playing with their food. Exercising that mental curiosity can even help mitigate other more destructive behaviors that dogs will engage in when bored (i.e. destroying your couch while you’re at the grocery store). It can also reduce stress, help with digestion, and supplement the benefits of exercise.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nAt this point, IwantedMoose toplay with his food— just not all over my hardwood floors. So, I went through some trial and error with different kinds ofpuzzle feeders. First, I tried a snuffle mat: a fabric mat with thick felt grass that you toss food into for your dog to find. It was great, at first. Unfortunately, after a week of meals, and Moose’s propensity to gnaw on the grass like an after-dinner toothpick, it absolutely reeked.\nNext, we tried a feeder ball, where food is placed inside a ball with a small opening that will dispense the food as your dog bats it around. It did, however, quickly become clear that Moose would not be forced to “sing for his supper” as the ball demanded. He batted it around once, got a singular piece of kibble, and promptly decided he would rather go on a hunger strike than be insulted by such a tease of a toy. Finally, we found our holy grail — a washable, fun, and shockingly aesthetically pleasing puzzle feeder:The Pet Dream House Interactive Feeder.\nPlus 6 stylish slow-feed dog bowls.\nDesigned to ensure healthy, slow, and fun feeding for your pup, this interactive feeder is a step above the rest. First, its base model is available in two levels: easy and advanced. I started Moose out on the easy level, which features a beautiful spinning tulip that can be pushed to reveal food underneath. Immediately, Moose was obsessed. Even being the famouslypicky eaterhe is, I could tell he wanted me to refill his bowl so he could keep playing.\nHis sister, the slightly more intuitive Harper, loves the advanced version and will occasionally nudge it around between mealtimes for another chance to play. Luckily, the Pet Dream House Feeder also features anti-slip grips on the bottom to ensure your dog’s playing doesn’t result in major spillage. But with Harper, who is a more aggressive eater, I’ve found that a few pieces of kibble do manage to fall onto the floor when she is in a more playful mood.\nStill, the best part of choosing a Pet Dream House feeder is the ability to purchase and change outdifferent puzzlesthat fit the base of the feeder. As with its base models, Pet Dream House rates its other puzzles based on different levels of difficulties, so you can  make the right purchase for your pup’s needs.\nThe only downside to this feeder is the price. While most other plastic feeders come in under $15, the Pet Dream House feeder is priced at a slightly more elevated $25. The detachable accessories do make this feeder more fun and much easier to clean, allowing your dog to play with their food — without your having to stand by with the vacuum.\nGives Back",

  "page_content": "Building trust and apositive relationshipwith a scared dog is a process that involves teaching your dog they can count on you not to scare them.Not scaring a dogmeans protecting them from situations that frighten them and working with them gradually to overcome their fears. It means never forcing them into situations that are too much for them, and it means proceeding only at the pace they can handle, not the paceyouwant.\nYou must provide lots of positive experiences that are not scary and that the dog can handle. It’s important to be the source of what makes them happy and what they enjoy so you are the one they count on to be safe and need not ever fear. That is how to gain a dog’s trust.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nEight ways to connect with your scared dog and build trust\nThere are two main strategies for building trust with a skittish dog. Be the source of good (unscary) experiences that lead to positive emotions for the dog, such as providing treats, playing with toys, and being both calm and gentle.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nDon’t be the source of bad (scary) experiences that lead to negative emotions for the dog, such as staring at them or other intimidating body language, loud chaos, or surprises. (Even if your dog is not skittish or nervous, this is how to get a dog to trust you and how to get a dog to like you.)\nThepurpose of the treatsis to get a skittish dog to associate you with positive emotions. The better the treats are, the easier that is. Experiment with a few kinds to see which are most appealing to them. Be generous with the treats; that makes it more likely the good feelings from treats can counteract the fears.\nSomething you can do every day is toss treats in their direction and then walk away while they eat them. They learn that you have treats, but also that you don’t put pressure on them to come to you to get them (that can be scary for fearful dogs!) and that you give them space every time to eat the treats.\nSome dogsreally love toys, and opportunities to play with them can open pups up to joy and fun after they’ve had rough times in their lives. Other fearful dogs who have suffered are too preoccupied with the basics of food, water, and safety to act playfully. Try calmly offering a fewdifferent types of toys, and see if they’re interested.\nAlso, understand that while they may not be interested now, that could change as they get more comfortable and relaxed. If they don’t take to toys right away, don’t give up — try again in the future. There is arguably nothing more rewarding and heartwarming than witnessing a rescue dog’sAha!moment when they joyfully play with a toy for the first time.\nLet the games begin.\nSome dogs do better with activity and motion than with the inherent tension of everyone standing still. Keep moving (try walking in big broad circles), and let them follow you and your other dogs, if you have them. Allow your dog to accompany you — or not — without paying any particular attention to them. This creates a low-pressure situation for many dogs, who will often join the movement.\nCalmness is comforting to fearful dogs, sobe calm in their presence. Speak in a soothing voice around your dog. Sit down in their presence, and avoid any sudden movements. Think about projecting calmness and steadiness as you would want anyone around you to do in a frightening situation.\nBe gentle in every interaction and move slowly. Avoid wildly waving your arms around as you talk. This is the one that’s hardest for me, personally, as I am one of those people who has a hard time expressing myself without using my hands.\nPrevious experiences or their genetic makeup (or both) — factors that are beyond your control — may limit a skittish dog’s capacity to interact. Continue to accept them forwho they are as an individual, respecting their limits and their timeline rather than pushing them to be like most dogs.\nBe patient and gentle. Eventually,your dog’s trust in you will grow, and their fear will diminish, but trying to rush your dog will only set you back rather than build the trust faster.\nBe predictable. If your dog knows what’s coming, they’ll be better able to handle it.Fearful dogs, including those who have not had a lot of interaction with people, do not like surprises.\nThey definitely don’t need you sneaking up on them, making sudden loud sounds, opening an umbrella near them, or doing anything else unexpected. Be predictable with your routines so, as much as possible, they know what to expect, and use cues to let your dog know what’s about to happen.\nEverything you need to know to get your new addition off to a good start.\nFor example, if you are about to feed your dog, say so, and if you are about to stand up, say so. When your dog learns that a certain word or phrase always predicts a certain action, it helps them feel more secure, which helps them trust you more.\nThere are many ways that we humans can make ourselves appear less intimidating to dogs. It helps to turn a little to the side rather than face them head on and to shift our body weight back away from them. Crouching down and staying at a distance are also effective. If you must approach, do so slowly rather than in a rush.\nSkip wearing a hat or backpack or carrying things, including boxes and clipboards when they’re around. This will help avoid setting nervous dogs off. Avert your eyes and don’t stare directly at them. Let them approach you rather than you going to them. If you have a beard, you could shave it off. That is a big commitment and asking a lot, but it can help you appear less intimidating to dogs.\nSo many dogs find all our talking anything but reassuring. Dogs don’t vocalize as much as people do, and many dogs who are fearful or skittish at all seem to relish the peace and quiet of silence from us. This doesn’t mean we have to be silent in our own homes or that we can’t communicate normally with the other humans in our homes. It does mean that prattling on in sweet tones or baby talk to our new friend could be counterproductive when the goal is to build trust with a scared dog.\nWhat if my dog is scared because they were previously abused?\nThere is no difference between how you treata fearful dog who was abused, compared with how you treat a fearful dog who wasn’t abused. You help them overcome their fears the same way, regardless of the cause.\nWhy is my dog scared of a specific type of person?\nFear in a dog is often because that type of person appears intimidating or because they have not been exposed to that type of person enough, especially as a young dog.\nWith patience and positive reinforcement, you can do a lot to make up for lost time with socialization.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nDogs arefearful for many reasons, includinggenetic tendencies, lack of adequate socialization, pain or underlying medical conditions, and past trauma such as being attacked, abused, or extremely startled.\nDogs become more confident if they have many positive experiences and if they have lots of training experiences where they are reinforced for their behavior.\nIdentifying the reason your dog is so scared is not always possible, but clues can be found in their past experiences, the behavior of their genetic relatives, and the specificity of their fears.\nWhen you see a dog scared of everything, it is likely because the dog’s genetics give them a tendency to be fearful or because theywere not adequately socialized, or possibly a combination of the two factors.",

  "page_content": "Is there anything sadder than the sound of a puppy whining? Even people who don’t consider themselves dog people would be hard-pressed toignore the pitiful-sounding criesof a sad puppy. But does whiningreallymean that a puppy is sad, or is it possible that your puppy is whining for no reason?\nWhether your puppy is keeping you up whining at night, whining in their crate no matter how cozy you make it, or you’re simply hoping todecipher their puppy-whining sounds, read on for answers.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWhy do puppies whine?\nWhy is my puppy whining?It’s a common question coming from new pet parents — after all, a puppy whining is as common asa baby crying. (And any parent knows babies cancry.)\nPuppies whine as a form of communication, expressing various needs or emotions. Common reasons for whining include seeking attention, expressing anxiety or fear, signaling discomfort or pain, or even expressing excitement. Understanding the specific context of the whining is crucial in addressing it effectively. If whining persists and is potentially linked to discomfort or pain, a visit to the veterinarian is recommended.\n“Puppies whine for many reasons, but most whining falls into one of three categories: physical discomfort, loneliness, and boredom,” says Lorrie Reynolds, owner ofMaximum Fun Dog Sports. Let’s take them one by one.\n“Pain” may be too strong of a word, depending on the situation, but whining may indicate some sort of physical distress, Reynolds says. These can include needing to pee or poop, being too hot or cold, or experiencing hunger pangs (puppieslike to eat— a lot).\n“Until you brought them home, your puppy was surrounded by their mother and siblings, as well as their breeder and family,” Reynolds says. It’s only natural that there is a period of adjustment to their new home.\nOnce again, it turns out puppies aren’t that different from human children. “Puppies also whine when they are bored or over-tired,” Reynolds says. “Just like toddlers, young puppies don’t know when they really need that nap, and whining can indicate that your puppy needs to sleep.”\nBabies cry, puppies whine, and both are absolutely normal behaviors. Whining is one of the best ways puppies have of communicating; like babies, they don’t have a wide vocabulary with which to express themselves. Barking, howling, and whining are about it — though those notoriouspuppy dog eyessure can say a thousand words.\nHow to stop puppies from whining\nAlthough whining is normal, that doesn’t mean it should ever be ignored. In order to figure out how to get a puppy to stop whining, you need to figure out why they’re upset — and the first order of business is finding out whether they arein physical distress. “Puppies need to know that you are reliable and they can count on you to take care of them,” Reynolds says. If they’re uncomfortable, it’s very important that you respond.” To that end, here’s a three-step plan to help a whimpering puppy.\nWhen you’ve gotta go, you’ve gotta go — and puppies aren’t going to be stoic about it. A quick walk (or placing them on a puppy pad indoors) will do the trick if this is the case.\nGetting bigger overnightburns up a lot of calories, so a snack may help a growing pup with a growling tummy. (Doesn’t a treat usually help you stop crying, too?)\nSince puppies are likely to get both lonely and tired, cuddling up for a nap together might be just what the doctor (er, veterinarian) ordered. That’s right —napping with your new petis good for both of you (especially if you’re suffering from a case ofthe puppy blues).\nA bored puppy is often a whiny puppy. To save your pooch from boredom, Reynolds suggests giving them a toy. “Rubber toys that are hollow (I like the Kong brand) can be filled with kibble and a little bit of yogurt and frozen. It will take your puppy quite a while to get all of the treats out.”\nHow to help a puppy who whines in the crate\nCrate-trainingis a fact of life for puppies — or at least, it should be, Reynolds says. “All puppies and dogs should be crate trained. You don’t want your dog’s first experience with a crate to be for an emergency at the veterinarian or in a boarding kennel,” she says. “Crate-training a puppy keeps them safe when you can’t watch them, to ensure they’re not chewing on or eating things they shouldn’t, and it makes house training significantly easier if puppies are confined when you can’t watch them.”\nThat said, puppies often whine when they’re in the crate. To curb this, try the following:\n“To make crate-training easier on your puppy, make sure you are playing with them after they’ve gone out to eliminate so they’re tired and ready to nap when you crate them,” Reynolds says.\nNot only will this make the crate extra comfy, your scent will comfort your puppy when you can’t be there to snuggle them. Choose a soft sweater or blanket to sleep with for a few nights, then transfer it to the crate (without washing it, of course).\nReynolds suggests making certain favorite toys special “crate-only” toys, so the crate becomes an appealing place for your pup, as well as feeding your puppy in the crate. “The association of the crate with a safe, fun, and food-filled place will eliminate that puppy whining before you know it,” she says.\n“If your puppy is whining at night, move their crate close to your bed, where you can softly reassure them that you are there,” Reynolds says. “Keep the crate close to you, gradually moving it further away over time until your puppy is comfortable being crated in a different room without whining.”\nThe more you play with, talk to, and cuddle with your puppy when they’re not in the crate, the easier it will be for them to adjust to alone time in the crate. “Make sure you are spending a lot of time with your puppy between sessions alone in a crate for naps,” Reynolds says.\nIf you’re thinking of letting your puppy “cry it out,” think again. Caroline Wilkinson, a certified canine behaviorist and founder of digital pet coaching serviceBarket Place, says ignoring your puppy’s cries can undermine your bond.\n“It’s really important that we’re present for our puppies, especially in the early days, so that they can learn to trust us and build a solid foundation for our ongoing relationship. Whining is a way of our puppies expressing a need, so it’s important to try andmeet whatever that need is.”\nOther tips for handling whining puppies\nReynolds offers a few more tips for keeping puppy whining to a minimum. If your puppy is crying and you can’t figure out why, go down this checklist:\nIf your puppy hasn’t been out to poop or pee in the past hour, take them out.\nIf your puppy hasn’t been out to poop or pee in the past hour, take them out.\nMake sure your pup is on a feeding schedule that has been recommended by your breeder or veterinarian, and that you have fed them the correct amount so they aren’t hungry.\nMake sure your pup is on a feeding schedule that has been recommended by your breeder or veterinarian, and that you have fed them the correct amount so they aren’t hungry.\nIf your pup seems to have other symptoms of being ill (lethargy, diarrhea, vomiting, etc., call your vet immediately).\nIf your pup seems to have other symptoms of being ill (lethargy, diarrhea, vomiting, etc., call your vet immediately).\nFAQs (People also ask):\nWhen do puppies stop whining? It varies, but generally, experts say it will decrease after a few weeks in their new home.\nA puppy who suddenly starts whining is trying to tell you something, so pay attention. If they’re not hungry, don’t need to pee or poo, and you’re right there with them, it may be time for a trip to the vet.\n“For excessive whining that doesn’t get better when your puppy has been outside, fed, and played with, always check with your veterinarian to make sure there is not a physical reason for the complaints,” Reynolds says.\nWilkinson concurs: “If your puppy is whining a lot of the time then it’s definitely important to get them checked out via your vet to ensure no underlying pain or discomfort is present.”",

  "page_content": "Does your dog growl and show their teeth if you come near them while they’re chewing on a bone? Do they stiffen if you try to take a toy from them? If you walk near them while they’re eating, do they eat faster?\nIf you answered “yes” to any of these questions, your dog is exhibiting behavior known as “resource guarding,” which is any behavior that a dog displays to convince others to stay away from something they consider valuable. This survival instinct might be useful for dogs in the wild, but it’s not ideal for a member of your fam. Keep reading to learn more about resource guarding in dogs — including how to get them to stop.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nWhat is resource guarding in dogs?\nResource guarding is a common and normal part of dog behavior. Signs of resource guarding in dogs include behaviors such asgrowling, tooth displaying, stiffening, frantic eating, glaring, snapping, barking, leaning over the resource to shield it, and biting. Dogs commonly guard food,toys, treats, bones, rawhides,beds, and even another dog ora person.\nIn many cases, resource guarding is subtle. A dog with a pig’s ear, for example, may turn their body to shield their precious treasure from anyone approaching, or they may pick it up and carry it to another room. They might put their paw on it or even give you a look that means something along the lines of “Don’t even think about it,” or “Please don’t take it away. I want it.” Few people are troubled by such mild forms of resource guarding.\nEven though resource guarding can become far more serious, there’s some good news. One, there are ways to prevent it in most dogs. Two, behavior modification plans usingcounterconditioning and desensitizationare easy to implement, and they are effective at improving the dog’s behavior. Three, many people choose to simply live with it, managing it as best they can. That may not sound very inspiring, but I consider any solution that keeps a dog at home and people safe while allowing a loving relationship between the two to flourish and grow to be a success.\nNo longer associate feeding time with growling time.\nWhat causes resource guarding in dogs?\nWhen considering what triggers resource guarding in dogs, it’s essential to understand that this behavior does not have a single cause. Rather, there are various causes of resource guarding dog behavior, and there can even be multiple reasons for this behavior in an individual dog. Dogs who resource guard generally do so for one or more of the following reasons:\nGenetics: Some dogs aregenetically predisposedto have trouble sharing and to act in a way that protects anything of value. Genetic tendencies may lead to dogs who guard their own items of value as well as those dogs who take a “What’s mine is mine, what’s yours is mine” approach to life.\nGenetics: Some dogs aregenetically predisposedto have trouble sharing and to act in a way that protects anything of value. Genetic tendencies may lead to dogs who guard their own items of value as well as those dogs who take a “What’s mine is mine, what’s yours is mine” approach to life.\nTraining: If dogs have repeatedly lost items of value because either a dog or a person regularly took them away, they may react by resource guarding going forward. Dogs with these experiences in the past have essentially been taught (trained!) that the only way to keep what they have is to guard it.\nTraining: If dogs have repeatedly lost items of value because either a dog or a person regularly took them away, they may react by resource guarding going forward.

For example, if a new dog who always takes, takes, takes joins the family, a dog may begin to resource guard as a protective measure.Resource guarding can also developas a young dog matures.\nChanges in the household: Sudden resource guarding in dogs may occur because of changes in the family.

If a dog has experienced not having enough food, or if there is only one toy or bone available, resource guarding is a strategy that allows them to have what they want or need. A dog who has experienced resource scarcity may always be a little fearful of not having enough, or may simply be in the habit of resource guarding, even though there are now plenty of toys, food, and bones available.\nScarce resources: If there is currently not enough to go around or the dog experienced such a shortage in the past, resource guarding can be the result.

A dog who has experienced resource scarcity may always be a little fearful of not having enough, or may simply be in the habit of resource guarding, even though there are now plenty of toys, food, and bones available.\nWhen your dog growls, they’re expressing their emotions. A study found that you’ll likely be able to understand what they’re feeling.\nWhat are the signs of resource guarding in dogs?\nResource guarding in dogs can take many forms — some are so subtle it’s easy to overlook them, and some are so obvious you can’t miss them. A dog doesn’t have to be snarling or biting to be resource guarding. Any behavior that a dog uses to keep something of value rather than lose it to someone else is resource guarding behavior. Common behaviors that are signs of resource guarding in dogs include:\nIntently watching others\nIntently watching others\nStiffening of the body\nStiffening of the body\nPutting a paw on the treasure\nPutting a paw on the treasure\nTaking the object further away or into another room\nTaking the object further away or into another room\nHovering over the object\nHovering over the object\nShielding the item from view\nShielding the item from view\nFrantically and quickly eating the item (if edible) when anyone approaches\nFrantically and quickly eating the item (if edible) when anyone approaches\nStaring\nStaring\nGrowling\nGrowling\nTooth displaying\nTooth displaying\nSnapping\nSnapping\nBiting\nBiting\nHow to prevent resource guarding\nDogs are often nervous about losing what they value. With that in mind, a key aspect of preventing resource guarding in dogs, includingfood-bowl aggression— its most common form — is to teach dogs to be happy when someone approaches or reaches for their treasure. Dogs who are happy in a particular context are a whole lot less likely to act aggressively.\nCreating this positive emotional reaction is simple: Teach your dog to associate the approach of a person withtreats. I advise people to walk toward their dog and toss a really good treat into the bowl or near their treasure. Once the dog is used to this, the next step is to walk over, pick up the bowl or the treasure, deliver a treat (in the bowl is fine), and then return the bowl or the treasure. It’s important to do this quickly — within a few seconds at most — so your dog doesn’t feel as if they’re being teased.\nI suggest doing this only once or twice per session; even though your dog gets a treat, the interruption can still be irritating. (I imagine dogs in that situation feel like I do when a restaurant server refills my water glass every time I take a sip: mildly harassed.)\nOther ways to prevent resource guarding include managing situations to avoid any opportunities for your dog to engage in this behavior. That includes being vigilant about removing and hiding items that your dog is likely to take and then guard. It also means that everyone in the family must avoid approaching or challenging the dog when they have food or a chew toy, or any other items that trigger their resource guarding behavior.\nTwo animal behavior experts agree it’s usuallyplay fighting. Here’s how you can tell.\nAvoid bad strategies\nYou may have been advised to put your hand in your dog’s food bowl or pick up the bowl and hold it. Unfortunately, this strategy is far more likely to lead to food-bowl aggression than to prevent it. Such actions are irksome, so it’s no surprise that many dogs will lose their temper eventually. While some dogs will never become resource guarders, even when provoked, others can be taught to be aggressive around their food. Some of the worst resource guarders I’ve ever seen were taught to be that way by their well-intentioned humans.\nPeople accidentally teach dogs to guard their resources in other ways, as well. If your dog has a bone (or food or a shoe or the remote control) and you take it from them, they learn that they lose treasures unless they take action. To avoid that, instead of taking something from your dog,tradethem for it. Hold a treat or other desirable object right by their nose, and if they drop the contraband, give them the offered item. This teaches them that they get paid for letting go of things (instead of getting mugged whenever they have something valuable.)\nIt’s very important to help your dog feel happy about releasing items and to actively avoid making it a negative experience. Trading is far better than a battle, and it’s very effective, especially if they’re “trading up,” or getting something better than what they surrendered.\nAnother strategy is to have your dog drop the object, give them a treat, and then give them back the item. This helps them learn that it’s worthwhile to release things. I like to teach the cue “drop it.” So, if a dog gets something they shouldn’t have, I can ask them to release it before they damage it — or themselves.\nConsidering this viral moment, trainers weigh in on what you should know about introducing dogs to kids.\nHow to stop resource guarding behavior\nGiving extra treats when your dog has something of value is a useful way to prevent resource guarding, but it can also be used to stop an existing behavior. (If your dog has previously bitten or threatened anyone, I advise having a behaviorist supervise this interaction.) “Counterconditioning” is the technical term for the strategy of teaching your dog to associate something they like, such as treats, with you approaching, reaching for, or taking something they have. “Desensitization” is the term for getting your dog used to you approaching, etc. when they have something they consider a treasure.\nStart by standing outside the dog’s reaction zone and tossing high-quality treats to them. The goal is to make them happy that a person is present when they have a treasure. This change in their emotional response is what will lead to a change in their behavior. The closer you get, the more intense the situation will become. The intensity will also increase if the dog has a more highly valued item, or if you approach, reach for, or pick up the resource.\nWork at each level of intensity until your dog is comfortable, and only then progress to something harder. The highest-intensity context is to approach your dog and take something they value highly. Success can only be achieved by gradually working toward that goal and requires many steps and many repetitions over a period of weeks and months.\nWhen it comes to resource guarding in dogs, training is always important for improving the behavior. Using counterconditioning and desensitization is a great way to train your dog to act differently in situations that used to lead to resource guarding and possibly even aggression. It’s a kindness to teach them to be able to handle — and even to enjoy!— people coming near them or reaching for them when they have something of value. Helping them to feel OK about what you’re doing is the best way to improve their behavior in such situations.\nThey’ll always remember their first childhood pet—this intro is just the beginning.\nLiving with resource guarding\nDespite the challenges of sharing a home with a dog who guards resources, it’s common for people to choose to live with it. People who have a dog with this predilection know when to expect the behavior, and they simply avoid going near their dog when they have a valued item. This predictability may account for the lack of concern many have about resource guarding. Of course, predictability varies depending on the household. A single person who rarely entertains is in a very different situation than afamily with five small kidswho have additional children over to play nearly every day.\nYears ago, the standard view was that a dog shouldn’t be approached at mealtimes or when they are chewing a bone or playing with a favorite toy, and there’s a lot of good sense in that. If you don’t bother your dog while they’re eating, and you purposely avoid going near them when they have a bone or other treasure, you will avoid trouble.\nLife with a dog who allows anyone to take anything away from them is pretty easy, but that’s really a lot to ask of even the dearest, sweetest dog on the planet. There are, of course, dogs who are as unlikely to guard resources as they are to calculate Schrödinger’s wave equation. But we shouldn’t assume that dogs who are lovely — but perhaps not so nonchalant about having resources taken from them — are bad.\nWith dogs who are at risk of causing injury, it’s obviously critical to have some way to keep everyone safe. You can deal with this problem by preventing situations that trigger problem behavior (particularly aggression) and with behavior modification that alters how your dog behaves when they have something of value. How important it is to train your dogs not to resource guard is an individual decision — you might be highly committed or willing to simply live with it.\nThe bottom line: Resource guarding is common, though less than desirable, dog behavior. I’m not excusing it or saying that it’s not a problem, but like barking and chewing, it is accepted by many people as part of living with a dog — although clearly, it’s nobody’s favorite part. Although it can be changed and improved with behavior modification, tons of people choose to accept it, figuring that life is too short to demand perfection of their best friend.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nWhen should I seek professional help for resource guarding?\nAssistance from a professional is essential if the resource-guarding dog has bitten or if there are children in the household. Even if there haven’t been any injuries and even if there are no kids present, seek professional help for resource guarding if you want to improve your dog’s behavior and prevent it from getting worse.\nResource guarding behavior in dogs can be stressful to live with, and a qualified canine behaviorist or dog trainer can help. They will teach you how to manage situations to avoid resource guarding problems, and instruct you about training exercises that will reduce the resource-guarding behavior.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nStrategies for safely taking something away from your dog include: training your dog to “drop it” on cue, trading for an item they want even more, and tossing treats so they drop the item to eat the treats.\nSpecific exercises to reduce resource guarding involve teaching your dog to associate people approaching, reaching for, and taking items of value away from them with receiving something good and feeling happy.\nIf your dog bites while guarding resources, seek professional help from a qualified behaviorist or trainer immediately. In the meantime, prevent another incident by avoiding the situation that caused the issue.\nReferences:\nUnderstanding Canine Resource Guarding Behaviour: An Epidemiological Approach\nUnderstanding Canine Resource Guarding Behaviour: An Epidemiological Approach\nFactors Associated With Canine Resource Guarding Behaviour in the Presence of People: A Cross-Sectional Survey of Dog Owners\nFactors Associated With Canine Resource Guarding Behaviour in the Presence of People: A Cross-Sectional Survey of Dog Owners\nDefining and Clarifying the Terms Canine Possessive Aggression and Resource Guarding: A Study of Expert Opinion\nDefining and Clarifying the Terms Canine Possessive Aggression and Resource Guarding: A Study of Expert Opinion\nAbility of Owners to Identify Resource guarding Behaviour in the Domestic Dog\nAbility of Owners to Identify Resource guarding Behaviour in the Domestic Dog",

But have you ever listened to your dog — like, really listened to them when they grumble or growl? Did you swear you could understand their deepest emotions and desires? It turns out, when your dog is growling, theyareexpressing their emotions — and most likely, you’ll be able to understand what they’re feeling.\nWhy do dogs growl?\nDogs growl in different contexts—when guarding something of value, when threatened by a stranger, and during play. These growls can sound remarkably similar to the novice human ear, but astudy in the journal Animal Behavioursuggests that the meanings of these growls are very different to dogs.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents.

The growls recorded during play were very different than the other types of growls — they were shorter and higher in pitch.After discovering the variance in sound, they tested the theory. They gave dogs the opportunity to approach a high-quality food item (a cooked meaty bone) when alone in a room. Then, they piped in the recorded sound of either a growl made when a dog was threatened by a stranger or a growl made by a dog guarding a bone. They tested 41 dogs in this way and found that dogs were significantly more likely to back away from the bone when they heard the bone-guarding growl than when they heard the threatened-by-a-stranger growl.\nIdentifying dog growls\nA studypublished infound that humans were able to identify dogs’ growls within the context of the setting. When given the options of three social situations (guarding food from another dog, playing tug with a person, and being approached by a stranger), people were able to differentiate what emotion the growling dog was experiencing in that moment. “We found that playful growl bouts are built up from short, quickly repeated growls, while the aggressive ones were more elongated,” explained lead researcher Tamás Faragó. “The food guarding growls differed from the threatening growls in their formant dispersion, a parameter that gives a size impression of the vocalizing individual for the listeners.”\nTwo animal behavior experts agree it’s usuallyplay fighting. Here’s how you can tell.\nPeople were asked to rate each growl on a sliding scale for each of the following emotions: fear, aggression, despair, happiness and playfulness. Overall, people correctly identified the context of 63 percent of the growls, which is significantly better than the 33 percent rate that chance predicts. The play growls were most readily identified, with 81 percent of them being correctly chosen. The food guarding growls were correctly identified 60 percent of the time, compared with 50 percent of the growls directed at strangers. Most of the errors in identifying these two (potentially aggressive) contexts involved confusion between the two of them, rather than with the playful context.\nIt may come as no surprise that dog people were better than non-dog people at correctly identifying a growl's meaning. The study also found that women were better at distinguishing between the growls. “This is a common pattern in emotion recognition studies,” says Tamás. “Probably [some] women are more empathic and sensitive to others’ emotions, and this helps them to better associate the contexts with the emotional content of the growls.”\nThe researchers’ takeaway from the study was that people can distinguish different types of dog growls, including being able to tell apart growls that are both in potentially aggressive contexts. Previous studies have found that people’s ability to understand canine growls is influenced by the time between growls and the duration of the growls — longer gaps between growls is associated with higher aggression scores. Shorter growls are generally perceived as more positive on emotional scales. In growls recorded in the context of a stranger approaching, the higher the pitch of the growl, the higher the fearfulness score.\nYoucanlive in a quiet house again.\nIndividual people varied in their ability to identify the context of the growls, too. Overall, women were better at it then men. Pet parents also outperformed people who do not have dogs. Whether or not a person had ever been bitten by a dog had no effect.\nDogs have a huge range of vocalizations and yet much remains to be learned about the differences in meanings of their vocal communication. These studies are one step towards a fuller understanding of the vocal repertoire of dogs and how we interpret their emotions.",

  "page_content": "Leash pulling can be addressed by using a good harness, as well as using your own movement with changes in speed and direction to be more interesting and better influence the dog’s behavior. You can also exercise your dog before a walk and usehigh-quality treatsto reinforce good leash manners. Other strategies include choosing the time of day when your dog is calmest and taking out-and-back routes so dogs are not so excited on the way back when the novelty of the area has worn off a little.\nFinally,trainingis always one of the best ways to influence your dog’s behavior. Some dogs who pull on the leash do so because they have not been taught to walk nicely with good leash manners, but they can learn to do it even if they are not one of the dogs who naturally walks without pulling on the leash.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nHow to stop a dog from pulling on the leash\nTeaching your dog towalk calmly on a leashwithout pulling will require patience and practice, but it can be done. There are many options for anyone interested in how to stop a dog from pulling on leash, and often the best success comes from combining multiple ideas. It will take a concerted effort and a commitment to consistency to shift your dog’s gears, but it will be worth it when you’re able to enjoy walking together with a slack leash between you. You’re not doomed to be pulled down the street like you’re waterskiing forever, I promise!\nChanging the equipment you use to walk your dog can make a huge difference in your experience right away. Theright kind of harnessputs physics on your side so your dog can’t lean in with their full body weight to drag you along. TheFreedom No-Pull Harness by 2 Hounds Designis a great option. Some people find bungee leashes helpful because the leash has a bit of give, but for strong, relentless pullers, I prefer a plain nylon, rope, or leather leash.\nIf dogs are allowed to keep going forward, they learn that pulling is the way to get what they want, and they will keep doing it. Don’t ever allow your pulling dog to continue on their merry way. If your dog pulls, there are two options:\nStop immediately and don’t move until your pup lets up and there is slack in the leash. You may have to stop again three seconds later and do the same thing, and that’s OK. Just be consistent about refusing to let them pull.\nStop immediately and don’t move until your pup lets up and there is slack in the leash. You may have to stop again three seconds later and do the same thing, and that’s OK. Just be consistent about refusing to let them pull.\nWhen they pull, turn and head in the other direction. That puts them behind you, at least momentarily, and your pup will not be pulling.\nWhen they pull, turn and head in the other direction. That puts them behind you, at least momentarily, and your pup will not be pulling.\nBoth of these training methods require a bit of patience, but hang in there — it’s worth the wait! Whether the dog is pulling or not, be unpredictable, and reinforce the preferred behavior. Making quick turns, reversing direction, speeding up and slowing down all make you more interesting, which means it’s more likely that your dog will follow you, going where you’re going rather than pulling you where they want to go. True, some of your neighbors will find it amusing, but consider it just another good thing you’re doing for the community!\nI know, I know. You’re probably thinking, “Isn’t the point of the walk togive my pup exercise?” Yes and no. Exercise is only one of the benefits of a dog walk. Dogs on walks also get to be in a new environment that can be more engaging than being home. They are able to sniff and see other people and dogs.\nFor now, the goal of the walk is to teach them to walk nicely so they can go on future walks rather than to meet all their exercise needs right now. If your pup is tired when you start out, they’re less likely to pull. That helps them develop good habits and also allows you to reinforce their good behavior so it becomes more likely in the future. Playing fetch in the yard, or even going up and down the stairs multiple times, can take the edge off their energy.\nWhile some dogs naturally walk calmly and politely all their lives with no specific instruction, that’s certainly not the norm. Most dogs need to learn how to do it with loose leash training. So, how to teach a dog to walk on a leash? Bringtop-quality treatson every walk and give them to your pup whenever they are doing the right thing: walking without pulling you.\nIf you want them to walk next to you rather than in front, offer them treats when they are in that position. The treats need to be out-of-this-world delicious — that usually means soft and smelly — to make an impact. Dry biscuits arenotgoing to be up to snuff for most dogs.\nMake it as easy as possible for your dog to do the right thing so you can reinforce them with those delicious treats. In addition to exercising your dog ahead of time (you can tell it’s important because I’m mentioning it twice!), there are other steps you can take to set your dog up for success.\nChoose the time of day carefully and go when they tend to be the least excitable. Many dogs are extra jumpy and energetic mid-morning and in the late afternoon, but may be more manageable closer to the crack of dawn or later in the evening. Walk them on an out-and-back route rather than a circular one. Many dogs pull on the way out but are more contained on the return because they’ve already investigated the route’s sights and smells.\nThere are dogs who pull when walked on a leash that is 6-feet long who don’t pull when they are on an eight or 10-foot (or even longer) leash. They may still be six feet away from you or even closer, but they don’t pull.\nOther dogs pull no matter how long the leash is — they just race out to the end of it and use the full force of their speed and body weight in an “I’m not into teamwork; thanks for asking” kind of way. You can’t know which category your dog is in until you try walking your dog on a longer leash, but longer leashes for dogs who pull can sometimes be a quick fix. If you don’t have a longer dog training leash, try securely attaching two leashes for an experimental walk, and only buy one if your dog’s behavior is better that way.\nWhy do dogs pull on the leash?\nPulling on leash happens for many reasons, and most dogs are engaging in this undesirable behavior for more than one of them. Generally speaking, dogs are pulling on leash because that behavior results in them getting what they want, or they are trying to get what they want by pulling. Among the common reasons dogs pull are:\nTo reach something that interests them such as atoy, aninteresting smellin the grass, a person, a dog, or a squirrel\nTo reach something that interests them such as atoy, aninteresting smellin the grass, a person, a dog, or a squirrel\nThey want to go faster than the current snail-like human pace\nThey want to go faster than the current snail-like human pace\nThey are too excited or too energetic to control themselves\nThey are too excited or too energetic to control themselves\nThey lean into the pressure on the collar\nThey lean into the pressure on the collar\nPulling has been reinforced in the past because they have previously gotten what they wanted by pulling\nPulling has been reinforced in the past because they have previously gotten what they wanted by pulling\nThey are frustrated by being attached to you\nThey are frustrated by being attached to you\nThey want to be a bit further from you or ahead of you\nThey want to be a bit further from you or ahead of you\nWhat is loose-leash walking, and does it help?\nThere is a tendency to think that either a dog is pulling on the leash and forcefully dragging their parent alongorthe dog is walking in a perfect heel position as if they are competing in formal obedience. There’s a beautiful middle ground that every dog parent should aim for, and that’s loose-leash walking.\nThat means your dog is walking with — wait for it! — a loose leash. That’s it, end of explanation. If you have a dog who walks on leash without pulling, there is slack in the leash, they wait for you, and they pay attention to the speed you are going to avoid creating tension on the leash, you have a dog who is successfully loose-leash walking. That also means you have a dog who is pleasant to walk and who very likely gets to go on more walks precisely because itisa pleasant experience for their parent.\nI only teach dogs to heel if their people want me to for any reason, and I teach the dogs in my own home this skill only because people expect me from time to time, as a professional trainer, to have a dog heel. (Also, it’s appealing and pretty to me, like many other tricks are, but that’s highly secondary.) I don’t needa heeling dog, though. All I need is a dog who walks with a loose leash so that nobody feels tension on the leash or gets pulled around\nFAQs (People also ask):\nMost dogs do best with a combo of treats for not pulling and for being in the right position, plus frequent turns in response to pulling. The way to know what’s most effective for your dog is to try both methods.\nThe best equipment for leash training dogs is either a harness that helps prevent pulling or a flat collar, a leash, and a lot of high-quality treats. That’s it!\nLunging and barking on walks may involve pulling, but there is no quick answer for improving this behavior. For now, turn away from what’s triggering this reaction. For long term improvement, consult with a professional behaviorist or trainer.\nReferences:\nWho Is Pulling the Leash?

    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/why-my-adult-dog-peeing-house"
  },
  "page_content": "Adult dogs may start peeing in the house for a variety of reasons, including health issues that must be addressed before the behavior can change. If medical causes are ruled out, potential emotional factors, such as grief or anxiety, should be considered. When house training a dog, including an adult dog who needs a refresher course, temporarily restrict the areas they can access, closely supervise them, and ensure you thoroughly and properly clean up after accidents.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nPotential causes for adult dogs peeing in the house\nToby is an eight-year-old Chihuahua we adopted when he was a year old. He was quickly house trained and never had an accident. About three years ago, we adopted an elderly dog, Coco, who turned out to be completely incontinent. We put down puppy pads and dealt with it; we knew she wouldn’t be around forever. A few weeks ago, Coco passed and now, Toby’s peeing in the house. (Or he may have been doing it for a while; while Coco was alive, we would have assumed it was her.) I can’t catch him in the act; he only does it when we aren’t home. He’s not left alone all day, and when we’re home, he’ll ask to go out. Can I retrain a middle-aged dog?It is very unsettling to suddenly realize that an adult dog seems to have lost the excellent housetraining skills you’ve taken for granted for years, and it can make anyone feel frantic to learn how to stop grown dogs from peeing in the house. Adult dogs don’t start peeing in the house for no reason, and figuring out the reason is an essential part of the solution.\nTips you’ll want to pay attention to.\nPotential causes for adult dogs peeing in the house\nIn many cases, an adult dog suddenly peeing in the house is a result of a medical issue, so it’s essential to consult with your veterinarian. A common cause of an adult dog peeing a lot, and therefore going in the house, is aurinary tract infection(UTIs).\nUTIs are more common in females than in males, which is why this health issue is one of the usual suspects when the question is, “Why is my female dog suddenly peeing in the house?”\nOther health issues that lead to an adult dog suddenly peeing in the house arekidney disease, a tumor, problemsafter being spayed(which can start to be a problem right away or even years later), separation anxiety, anddiabetes.\nSome medications make dogs extra thirsty, causing them to drink so much water they can’t hold it as long, so they go in the house. If your adult dog has started a new medication, is suddenly peeing in the house, and you are also wondering why your dog is peeing so much, schedule a visit with the veterinarian.\nAge can be a factor; it’s not unusual for older dogs to pee in the house, even though they never used to. Some dogs leak urine because their sphincter no longer has the strength to fully close and keep urine in. This is more common in older dogs but can affect dogs of other ages, too.\nDogs with painful arthritis, again more common in older dogs but not confined to those in their golden years, sometimes struggle to get up in time to make it to the potty, causing them to pee in the house. Many older dogs simply have to relieve themselves more often. If this is the issue, more frequent trips outside may stop an old dog from peeing in the house.\nOn the behavioral side, there are many reasons why adult dogs may suddenly start to pee in the house. In some cases, a dog is not really house trained, but their parent has been encouraging them to go out to pee on a regular schedule, and if the routine changes, the dog may pee inside. There are dogs who resist going outside in bad weather and end up peeing inside instead.\nThese unfortunate conditions can include extreme cold, high winds, rain, or snow. Sometimes,dogs become afraidof the yard or of peeing out there for some reason, causing them to pee inside instead. Fears can result from being outside when there’s a huge clap of thunder, stepping on something painful such as a thorn, a bee that stings them, or a person scaring them while they are out there. If the dog happens to be peeing when the scary thing happens, the dog may be comfortable in the yard in general but afraid to pee outside.\nAlthough it’s possible Toby simply needs a refresher course in where to pee, I suspect something else may be going on here. The first priority is to check for a medical issue, so an appointment with your veterinarian is in order. Sometimes, there’s a physical cause for a dog peeing in the house, with a urinary tract infection being just one possibility. A medical problem may make them need to go pee more frequently or with increased urgency, which may be why they can’t hold it as long as usual, and why there’s no problem if you’re there to let him out. It’s worth keeping track of how often Toby asks to go out when you’re home to see if he is going more frequently than normal.\nTips you’ll want to pay attention to.\nAssuming physical reasons can be ruled out, there are other potential causes. As you say, it’s possible he had this issue before, but it was masked by the natural belief that any urine inside was from Coco. It could also be a reaction to the loss of Coco;dogs grieve, too, and he may be missing her. Orseparation anxietymay have come into play. For three years, he had Coco for company when you were gone. Now, he’s truly alone in your absence, no matter how short those absences are.\nClearly, Toby needs to relearn to pee outside (and outside only) rather than inside, but if separation anxiety or physical issues are diagnosed, those need to be treated before he’ll be able to succeed. Then, it’s time to work on the house training aspect. Here are a few tips to make it easier for him to go potty where you want him to.\nHow to house train a dog\nHow youclean up after an accidentis important. What matters most is removing the odor that acts like a neon sign flashing the words “pee here!” Household cleaners may smell fresh and clean to humans — but not to dogs. Many contain ammonia, and ammonia gives off an odor that attracts dogs as if it were urine. Use an enzymatic cleaner designed to chemically neutralize the urine instead. Baking soda or club soda can do this, though not as effectively.\nDogs are less likely to pee in areas in which they spend time, so keep your dog in just one or two rooms for a while. Spending time in those areas will increase the likelihood they won’t want to pee in them. But don’t isolate them; choose the rooms that you also spend the most time in. The idea is to make those rooms their home, and that won’t work as well if you’re not there, too.\nIt’s like your 30-day yoga challenge — except with way more training treats.\nWith the scent of the whole family all around, they’re more likely to want to keep that area clean. With success, add rooms to their “home area.” Being on the floor with them will add your scent, which also makes it easier for them to grasp that these areas are out of bounds for elimination.\nWhile your dog is relearning their house training skills, it is important that they be in one of only three situations:\nOutside with you: If they’re outside, they have the opportunity to pee in the proper place. Because you’re with them, you’ll know if they’ve actually gone or just sniffed around, watched the birds, or chewed on a toy. If they do go pee, you’re right there to reinforce them with a treat, so they learn they’ve done the right thing.\nInside, under your constant supervision: Watching a dog every second for signs they need to go out is a lot of work, but it’s the best way to be alerted to their needs. Many dogs circle, sniff, head to the back door, pace, whine, head to an area they have peed in before, seem distracted, or refuse a favorite treat or toy when they need to potty.\nIf your dog lets you know when they need to go out when you’re home, this may not be necessary. However, it’s also possible they’ve gone in the house while you were home, but you didn’t notice right away and assumed it happened when you were out. I’ve heard this many times from people who didn’t realize their dogs had peed inside until they started keeping a closer eye on them.\nConfined in a small area when you are not around: When you can’t watch them,confine them to a small space, where they’re unlikely to make a mess. A crate, the laundry room, or a bathroom — any place they’re comfortable — are all options. Many dogs don’t like to be in peed-in places and are less likely to pee in a small space, especially if they sleep or rest there regularly. This doesn’t mean a dog who can’t hold it any longer or a dog who is peeing in the house because of stress will hold it, but it can encourage many dogs to do so for at least a while longer. Additionally, if a dog does pee in this area, clean-up is at least confined to a spot that is (ideally) easier to clean than other areas of the house.\nIn the early stages of house training a dog, you should not put your dog in any other situation. Once your dog has progressed and is better at peeing only where you want them to, you can consider relaxing these rules.\nFinal pieces of advice: Do not, under any circumstance, punish your dog for peeing inside the house. That can be scary and distressing and can damage both your relationship and the house training progress itself. Be patient. Remember, your dog is struggling and deserves your support, comfort, and assistance. They may be as upset about the peeing in the house as you are, or may beone of those dogs who is tricky to train.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nEnzymatic cleaners prevent the house from smelling like the bathroom, which can help stop urination indoors. Indoor puppy pads can prevent cleaning hassles.\nDogs often pee in spots that smell like urine, so if you don’t use an enzymatic cleaner to remove the odor, they will consider it the place to pee.\nBoth males and females can develop health issues such as urinary tract infections, kidney disease, or tumors, but female dogs can also suffer incontinence due to being spayed, though the issue may show up years after the procedure.",

  "page_content": "That work-from-home life is something some of us have been doing for years. The COVID-19 started nearly four years ago, and we’ve gotten used to terms like “hybrid working,” which means wedohave to leave the house sometimes. Or maybe your company wants you to be back full-time for those in-person board room meetings and Wednesday happy hours. No matter your reality, your pup doesn’t see you as much as they did for a couple years there, and it stresses them out. It’s beyond time to startseparation anxiety-training with your dog.\nWhat is separation anxiety in dogs?\nSeparation anxietyis a common behavioral disorder in dogs that occurs when a dog experiences panic or fear when they’re left alone. It can be treated with enrichment, training, and medication. It’s important to be patient and consistent because treatment can take time. If you are struggling to help your dog, consider working with a certified professional dog trainer or behaviorist.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nHow does separation-anxiety training work?\nWhensomeone is scared— dogs, cats, people, you name it — you can teach them to overcome their fear by using a behavioral psychology process called systematic desensitization. Basically, you introduce the thing that is scary but at a level that is not scary.\nSo, if you want to help your dog overcome their fear, you’d first need to figure out how far away they can be from whatever is causing their fear without being scared. Let’s say that distance is 10 feet away. That means you’d start your training at 10 feet away when your dog is completely relaxed. Great. Let’s see if you can inch a little closer. Nine feet away — still no problem. Eight feet — you’re good. Seven feet —gulp! Way too close. Let’s back ’er up a bit…7.5 feet — all good. Little by little, you move closer, but only as long as your pup still feels fine. The key is controlling that distance so that they can always feel safe.\nDoes your dog freak out when you head for the door? Here’s some advice.\nUnderstanding separation anxiety in dogs\nLet’s apply this to dogs who are scared to be alone now. Pups are not dummies. They’ve figured out that every time the keys make that jingly sound or the jacket goes on, their people leave through that door, and their terror begins. They tell us they’re anxious bygiving us signals.\nDogs with separation anxiety will whimper, stiffen, yawn, lick their lips,bark, howl, jump up to the door knob, scratch and chew the door (or the frame and the floor), lose their bladders orbreak out of their cratesand cut themselves in the process.\nAll of those behaviors are rooted in fear. Notice how your dog does not do that when someone else is there? They’re scared when they’re alone, and so if you stop scaring them, the“bad” behaviorsgo away, too.\nIt’s 2023, and the office is calling. How can our dogs cope?\nHow to train a dog with separation anxiety\nRather than thinking of separation anxiety-training as something to “teach your dog that you always come back,” think of it as training to “teach your dog that nothing bad ever happens when you walk out the door.” In order to do that, you have to watch theirbody languageto control how long you are gone.\nWhen you turn your door knob, does your dog fly to the door? If so, don’t turn the door knob yet. Just walk to the door and go back and sit down. Can you open the door halfway, but all the way is too far? Fine, only open it halfway until your dog doesn’t even look up when you go to do that. Can you stand outside with the door closed for one second, but two seconds is too long? OK! Great info. Keep it under two seconds. Get the idea?\nPick one or two times a day to do 30 minutes of alone-time exercises, five to six days a week. Practice the actions leading up to leaving your dog alone to teach your pup there is nothing to fear. You’ll do this by grabbing the keys, turning the door, or walking to the door — whatever their tolerance level is. Don’t push them; ensure their body language stays positive. The goal is to show them it’s safe.\nMake sure your dog is totally relaxed before you leave again. If you leave while they're still excited about your previous return, they will be too aroused for the next trial and have less tolerance, which could make the issue worse (not better).\nIf your dog is panting, yawning, salivating, pacing, or trembling, they are too stressed for you to continue. Back up and shorten how long you leave them alone until they are relaxed again. Then continue building up their tolerance — slowly.\nAs the old saying goes, “A tired dog is a good dog. Exercising your dog’s body and mind is a good way to decrease their stress so they're less anxious when you leave the house. Make sure your dog is getting plenty of exercise, and play fun, interactive games with them.\nWe asked both animal behaviorists and human psychologists howyoucan deal with leaving your dog home alone.\nKeep training as they get better.\nAs your dog gets used to simple acts like walking to the door and touching the handle, introduce departure-related objects (keys, jackets, purse) one at a time. Mix up the training regiment with easy and more complex tasks. For example, walk to the door and turn the handle halfway; other times, grab your jacket and put on your shoes before doing so.\nTeach your dog that nothing bad ever happens when you walk out the door before anything bad does happen. Up to 55 percent of dogs worldwide exhibit some kind of separation-related problem, so why risk that happening to your dog, too?

  "page_content": "During the holidays, my dog discovered the joys of entertaining — beginning with cookies and hors d’oeuvres on the coffee table, then graduating to leaping onto the counter for other delectables while we were busy entertaining our guests in another room. She never did this before! How do I train my dog to keep off the counter without resorting to crating her when we’re home? Other than this, she’s a great hostess.\nFor starters: put yourself in your dog’s paws. The next time you’re hungry, place your favorite food on the table and see if you can resist taking a bite. Even humans who have difficulty controlling themselves expect their pups to resist temptation when food is placed right in front of them (impossible!). Here, my advice for preventing your dog from devouring your countertop spread:\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nHow to stop counter surfing\nIn order to set up your dog for success while ensuring their safety, it is much more realistic to use a mixture of management and training techniques to keep dogs from counter surfing. Dogs are opportunists; the more successful they are at getting food from kitchen counters or the table, the more they will try.\nBecause nobody wants your pup eating the host’s charcuterie platter.\nBlocking access by using baby gates or putting your dog in another room if you have company is one way to ensure they don’t have an opportunity to surf and thus, reward themselves for this activity.\nWork on training by drawing an imaginary line along the floor and teaching your dog to stay behind that line. If they try to cross, gently block them with your body until they retreat behind the line again. When they stay behind the line, reward them at various intervals and they will see the area as a positive place to be. It will take time and patience for your dog to learn this skill, so it’s important to keep up blocking access when not actively training.\nAsKaren B. London writes, “Teaching a dog to do something is one part of dog training, but most of the effort is about getting them to do it regardless of what else is going on — helping them learn to succeed no matter how distracting the environment and how enticing the treasure.” A reliable sit-stay cue also needs to be taught first so that they understand what is expected.\nDo these things to help your pup (and your guests) feel chill.\nHigh-tech training solutions\nAs counter-surfing happens mostly when no one’s around (dogs are smart!), you can try going high-tech with a special two-way radio collar that allows your dog to hear your voice right next to their ear even when you’re in another room.\nPut some food on the counter and then walk away to a place where you can still see the food. Pretend to be doing something else so your dog thinks your attention is off them.\nWait for your dog to go up to the counter, and just before they jump up, ask your pup to “leave it.” If they back away, praise them.\nStart this exercise using low-value food before making it more difficult with your dog’s favorite treat. This technique might cause a little confusion at first, but your dog will soon learn that the “all-seeing eye” is everywhere, even if you aren’t in the immediate vicinity.  While you are entertaining, you can also provide your dog with something else to focus on by giving them an interactive toy such as a treat ball or aKong filled with food. This will most likely tire them out while filling them up — and ensure your food goes untouched.\nThe superfood is delicious, and it’s a natural remedy for some common pup ailments.\nCounter-surfing deterrent\nHere’s an example of whatnotto do if you have a counter surfing dog: One of my clients, fed up with her dog stealing food when her back was turned, placed “scat mats” (electrified mats) on the kitchen counters. On his first encounter with the mats, her dog received such a jolt that he squealed and ran out of the kitchen. The scat mats seemed to have done the trick, and the woman was pleased with the result.\nThe “success” was short-lived, however. The only entrance to the backyard was through the kitchen, and when it was time for the dog to go outside, he flatly refused to go anywhere near the kitchen area. Not surprisingly, he also began to have accidents inside the home. A counter-surfing issue had turned into major anxiety for the dog, and it was some time before the dog would walk through the kitchen to go to the backyard.",

  "page_content": "One of our small dogs tends to get excited —veryexcited — when it’s time for a walk, or dinner, or play, or pretty much anything that looks like it could be fun. She spends a lot of time in a state of eager anticipation — “Oh boy, what are we going to do now?!” If we’ve been quiet for a while, and then get up to do something, she does a happy dance. While it’s easy to assume a dog’s exuberance means they’re happy, the opposite may be true: Overexcited dogs may be stressed and anxious, which can lead to behavioral issues. Here’s why dogs get overexcited, plus some tips for how to calm them down.\nOverexcited dog? How to calm a dog down\nIt is important to be patient and consistent when trying to calm an overexcited dog. With time and patience, you can help your dog learn how to relax and control their excitement. To calm an overexcited dog, create a calm environment, distract them, teach them a calming cue, massage them, speak in a calm voice, take them for a walk, or give them a break.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWhy dogs get overexcited\nAnticipating something fires up the seeking circuit in the brain, which releases pleasurable chemicals, such as dopamine. When a dog hunts, for example, that circuit is activated. The dog enjoys the act of hunting, which would be excellent in the natural world, where hunting would be necessary for survival. If a dog didn’t want to hunt, they probably wouldn’t survive long. When you think about it, hunting is the ultimate anticipatory act.\nDo these things to help your pup (and your guests) feel chill.\nPeople who train their dogs for sports often use the combination of eager anticipation and excitement for their own ends — retrieving,nosework,agility, dock-diving. It can, however, cause problems both in and outside the home if your dog gets overly excited or aroused when you don’t want them to.\nThis energy system is also activated when a dog is alarmed. At the sound of an unknown noise or unexpected sight, epinephrine (adrenaline) is released, preparing the body for action — either fight or flight. The heart rate increases, and blood is sent to the muscles needed for rapid movement and away from the surface of the skin.\nSo, if the dog needs to fight, they won’t feel much pain until after the fight is over. If the dog needs to flee, they can go much faster and much farther than they would if they weren’t pumped up with chemicals. Epinephrine is very good for animals in the wild, where an action not taken can end in death; however, it’s not always useful in our world. And it can take a long time for the dog to calm down after going into arousal (days even, for some dogs).\nWant help with your pet's behavior right now?

For under $5/month.\nHow overexcitement can cause chaos\nOne of the problems with arousal is that it appears to be addictive. When a dog sees another dog and goes into a state of excitement (whining,pulling on the leash, sometimesbarking), they might be anxious and alarmed — or they might be enjoying the dopamine rush. Sometimes, the dog might start out being frightened, but over time, they lose their fear and just go into eager anticipation, particularly when they can predict certain situations.\nSome dogs might eagerly anticipate the house on the block where they know a dog will bebarking behind a fence. They’ll pull their human all the way there, and then bark and lunge at the fence. Often, they’ll bark at the fence, whether the other dog is there or not. These dogs are addicted to the high. You could probably offer them whole steaks, and they wouldn’t eat them — until they’ve finished barking.\nMany dogs will sit at a window or in their yard and just wait, anticipating that a bird might sit on a tree, or a squirrel may run along a fence. When that happens, their barking can be startling and, well, extremely annoying. If you tell your dog to stop, it generally won’t work. If you call your dog back andreward the recall, the barking will cease, but now you feel like you’re rewarding barking. If you don’t do anything, the behavior will generally get worse. Most dogs don’t get used to the squirrels and stop responding to them because it feels so good to bark.\nIs the term “prey drive” correct terminology or jargon?\nThink of arousal as a red cloud of energy that interferes with your dog’s judgment and causes this undesired behavior. Sometimes, arousal manifests as uncontrolled excitement, sometimes with a target (another dog, perhaps) or sometimes not (puppy rushes or “zoomies”). Sometimes, it is sustained anticipation. No matter what, there doesn’t seem to be a lot of conscious thought going on while a dog is in that state, probably because the chemicals activated in their brains have little to do with thinking.\nArousal canlead to aggressiontoward other dogs, pets, or people and even major destruction. Many dog attacks are caused by arousal, often in conjunction with their predatory drive, which can also cause dogs to get out of control.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s pro tips for walking a pup that wantsto chase everything that moves.\nAlthough it’s probably not intentional, if you’re gone for eight to 10 hours, it’s likely that you’re coming home to a bored and lonely dog. Your entrance might cause them to go into paroxysms of delight, racing around, picking up toys or balls, and/or leaping up on you. If, right after that, you take your dog out for exercise, you may compound that excitement.\nHow to calm an overexcited dog\nSome dogs are naturally calmer than others, but you can help easily aroused dogs learn to inhibit their excitement and learn that other emotional states are a good thing. You can do this by analyzing when your dog getsexcited or anxiousand actively working to remove the stimulation or counteract it. Here are other tips for how to calm an overexcited dog:\nIn terms of training, obedience — sit, come, down, stay,polite walking— is always valuable, particularly if you practice on a daily basis, first in calm areas, and then in areas that might ordinarily excite your dog.\nTeaching your dog to use their nose is also an excellent way to increase their focus and decrease excitability. Just tossing a bunch of kibble in the yard and then letting them search for it will help. At first, your dog will run madly around the yard, but as their instincts are honed, they’ll be able to show more concentration. Your dog’s nose is their primary sense — may as well use it.\nPost-training play may extend a dog’s memory of previously learned behaviors by up to a year.\nInterrupt your dog frequently during play — call them to you, have them sit, and then let them return to play. After their play session, make sure they relax before you start a new activity. If you take a dog out right after they’ve played enthusiastically, they’re likely to be ready for more action!\nDogs can get overly aroused when youcome home and greet them, so calm, matter-of-fact greetings — or no greetings at all — might help them calm down. And dogs can get extremely aroused when they think a walk is in the picture. Mixing up cues helps calm these dogs — picking up the leash and then putting it back down again, doing the same with keys, or reading the newspaper until the dog settles — are all ways to teach your dog that you’re not going anywhere until the energy is right. Dogs get very excited around meal times, so varying the time you serve meals will help them control their anticipation.\nYou can also show dogs how to relax and help them learn to enjoy it. Having your dog lie down and then gently petting them will make reinforce relaxation. It can also be helpful to have them sit quietly while watching others.\nOne of the most useful techniques for Strider, a German Shepherd withleash reactivity, was having him lie down on his rug close to people playing dog sports, likefly-ball and agility, both of which tend to be very active and noisy. At first, he got reinforced every few seconds with atreat on the ground(where he had to look for it). After he learned to relax, we didn’t need to use the food reinforcement — just lying on his rug became enjoyable.\nThe most mouth-watering treats for training your pup.\nThe bottom line: Be prepared\nSometimes, despite our best efforts, our dogs go into an overly excitable mode. When they’re like this, pretty much anything can take them over the top, whether it’s a buzzard flying overhead, a dog walking half a block away, or a jogger coming up from behind. Instant relaxation is obviously not possible, so what do you do?\nFirst, it’s a good idea to prepare mentally for situations such as these. Ask yourself what you would do if a bicycle suddenly turned a corner ahead of you and zoomed past. Or if another excitable dog started barking at your dog. Often, just practicing a smooth move over and over again will take a lot of the impact away. Pulling a u-turn or moving to the side of the road can be effective. If your dog is already excited, then following the u-turn with some jogging might help move the energy in the direction you’d like. Remember, your dog doesn’t know they’re doing something “wrong” — they’re just responding to stimulation in their environment.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nThere are many products that can potentiallyhelp your dog calm down, ranging from lick mats topheromone productsto prescription medication.\nDog owners can inadvertantly increase their dog’s excitement level — it’s important to stay calm and keep your tone of voice neutral, especially when greeting your dog.\nYes, patience is essential — when you’re patient with an overexcited dog, it will make you less reactive so you’re better able to respond to them calmly.\nReferences:\nTraining a High-Energy Dog to Calm Down\nTraining a High-Energy Dog to Calm Down\nBreed Differences in Social Cognition, Inhibitory Control, and Spatial Problem-Solving Ability in the Domestic Dog\nBreed Differences in Social Cognition, Inhibitory Control, and Spatial Problem-Solving Ability in the Domestic Dog\nA Survey Of The Behaviour Of UK Household Dogs\nA Survey Of The Behaviour Of UK Household Dogs\nExcitement and Aggression\nExcitement and Aggression\nThe Impact of Patience in Dog Training and Rehabilitation\nThe Impact of Patience in Dog Training and Rehabilitation",

  "page_content": "I’m hosting a dinner soon but I’m a little concerned about my dogs’ bad manners. They are pretty high-spirited pups, who tend to bark at, jump on, and lick anyone who walks through the door. Most of my friends love dogs, but not all. In the past, I've tried redirection, keeping the dogs confined in another room (this curbs the jumping and licking, not the barking), and having a dedicated dog person monitor the dogs. Do you have any other tips?\nHaving guests is a real challenge for people with friendly, exuberant dogs. The good news is there are a lot of ways to ease the social awkwardness when enthusiastic dogs collide (sometimes literally) with humans. You’re definitely on the right track with your plans to manage the situation. The smallest details can make a big difference, so by tweaking what you’re already doing and adding some new tactics, we can develop an approach that will help your dogs be their best selves. Here are some ways to tone down your dog’s overly excited greeting style.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nRedirect your dog with an irresistible item.\nThis is a great strategy, but it only works if what you offer is amazing enough to keep their attention. For toy-motivated dogs, a game of fetch or tug as visitors arrive may help them channel their excitement. Also, using top-quality, rarely offered treats or chews that the dogs care about can make all the difference.\nLet the games begin.\nA list of options that may refocus even the most social dogs’ interest includes real bones;Kongsstuffed with steak, chicken orpeanut butter; Greenies; bully sticks; and stuffed cow hooves. (A caveat: Check with your veterinarian to find out what items are safe for your particular dog, and which should be avoided.)\nBriefly confine your dog in a room, behind a gate or in a puppy pen.\nConsider putting your dogs in another room until guests come in and are seated. The whole entrance thing — seeing new people as the door opens, then seeing them cross the threshold and enter the house — can be especially stimulating for dogs. Some can greet guests far more calmly and politely if they don’t witness the actual arrival. It’s common for dogs to be less excitable when they come out of another room and see people sitting down.\n6 puppy pens recommended by positive-reinforcement dog trainer Aislynn Ross, because we all need boundaries.\nSome dogs are able to greet guests in a calm way if they first see them from behind a gate, which prevents them from rushing up to the newcomers. Once the novelty wears off, they can greet more politely. (However, perhaps out of frustration, some dogs getmorerevved up if they’re gated-off from visitors. Test this with your dogs in advance to find out how they respond.)\nTrain your dog to go to their “place.”\nThere’s often so much focus on what wedon’twant our dogs to do that we miss opportunities to teach them what wedowant. How would you like your dogs to greet visitors? With that picture in mind, actively teach them to do it. One option is to train them to sit and stay in a specific spot when visitors arrive. Make it a comfortable place, such as a dog bed or bean bag.\nIf visitors want to greet the dogs, they get to interact; if the visitors choose not to, then the dogs stay quietly in their place. Begin teaching them the behavior (going to their spot) when there are no distractions, and work up to more challenging and exciting situations.",

It’s actually a literal warning.\nAnd it’s never more true than when a dog reacts aggressively when startled during sleep. This reaction, known as sleep-startle reflex in dogs, can be pretty scary, especially if there are kids, older folks, or people with disabilities.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nMany dogs will easily shake it off when woken suddenly.

The good news is there are ways to deal with sleep-startle reflex in dogs.\nWhat is Sleep-Startle Reflex in Dogs?\nThe startle reflex is instinctive in wild animals. There are many dangers that they need to react to quickly, and assuming that the disturbance is a foe (rather than a friend) is only practical. The seconds that it takes to assess what woke them could mean life or death for many animals in the wild or out on the streets.\nDomestic dogs still carry some of these wild traits, and it’s not uncommon for a sleeping dog to attempt a bite when startled awake by touch, movement, or noise. Greyhounds are one dog breed that is known to commonly carry this reflex.\nDogs need more sleep than humans. Here’s how much is healthy.\nDogs enter into REM quicker than humans.It is impossible to know how deeply your dog is sleeping and what will startle them awake. This is why sleep-startle reflex can be alarming. In almost all cases, your dog will see within a second or two that it was just you and will immediately stop. It is important to note that this reflex is a reaction and not aggression. Dogs who have sleep-startle reflex are not consciously attacking.\nHow to Deal With Sleep-Startle Reflex in Dogs\nAnyone with a dog who suffers from sleep-startle reflex must first accept that it’s just the way they are. It cannot be trained out, and it certainly cannot be resolved using any form of punishment.\nShouting, scolding, or physically reprimanding your dog will not cure this condition. It is more likely to create a fear of falling asleep; your dog worries whether they will be unexpectedly woken and punished. Your dog will not be able to associate the reaction to the punishment because it was not conscious or deliberate. They will associate sleeping with the punishment.\nFinding a gentle way to rouse your dog without startling them is the key. Dogs will typically take naps throughout the day, but this sleep is not always deep.\nStep one: Never put your face close to theirs.\nCall their name calmly and quietly to stir them; then, you should be able to move near or around them safely.\nCall their name calmly and quietly to stir them; then, you should be able to move near or around them safely.\nWarn your family, friends, and visitors that your dog has this condition.\nWarn your family, friends, and visitors that your dog has this condition.\nEducate children that they should not disturb a sleeping dog, especially not someone else’s.

  "page_content": "If there’s one thing we’ve learned over the past few years, it’s the importance of wearing a mask. Just as we’ve spent nearly three years combating misinformation and ignorance around face masks, many pet parents have been stuck in a similar loop for much longer when it comes to muzzles.\nThey know all too well the benefits of letting their dogs rock a Bane fit while enduring the negative stereotypes associated with looking like one of theBatmanfranchise’s most infamous villains. One organization has been working to ease some of that stress and teach other dog owners and bystanders not to fear muzzles — but instead celebrate them.The Muzzle Up! Projectis a San Francisco-based advocacy, training, and education servicefighting stigmasagainst dog parents who muzzle their pets.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nBeyond the Muzzle\nThe group was started in 2013 by Maureen Backman, a private dog trainer at the time, who had her ambitions set on altering common misconceptions about muzzle use.\n“I remember as a new baby dog trainer seeing her posts and being so in love with the message she was sending, Sarah McManaman, director of operations at The Muzzle Up! Project, says. “There was always a big emphasis on empowering dogs and working together as a team. I really appreciated having that be one of my influences.”\nBackman founded the organization hoping to normalize muzzle use and offer training without judgment. While she would eventually leave the Muzzle Up! Project to focus on a career in human therapy, her mission, and the collaborative ethos she established remain.\nMuzzle Up partners with trainers and rescues across the U.S. to alleviate fears about muzzling pups and help demonstrate how best to use them. The training tool has been historically misunderstood as merely a safeguard against biting, ultimately resulting in the  assumption that any dog wearing one is dangerous.\nNow, this concept isn’t entirely difficult to understand. If you saw someone walking around the park wearing a Hannibal Lecter mask, you’d probably cross the street, too. But with dogs, there are plenty of reasons unrelated to protecting flesh that one might wear a muzzle.\n“Yes, muzzles do help prevent bites. But they also help dogs with certain medical conditions like PICA, where they compulsively want to eat non-food items,” McManaman explains.\nShe also notes that muzzles also help keep vet staffs safe; a panicked dog or one that is in pain is more likely to bite, even if it’s out of character. While it might be unlikely, a dog who is severely injured can lash out in an attempt to protect themself from further pain. If your dog understands how to properly wear a muzzle and is comfortable doing so, it’s less stressful for you and prevents a potentially terrible situation.\nEducate, Educate, Educate\nOf course, Muzzle Up doesn’t condemn those who are unaware of all the reasons why someone might muzzle their dog. Instead, the team sees it as an opportunity for some polite teaching.\n“I feel like most people who are unaware of all the reasons someone may muzzle their dog assume that a muzzled dog must be a dangerous dog. We were all that person at one point, so when someone is questioning why your dog is muzzled or making assumptions that is an opportunity to gently educate,” says McManaman.\nThe online discourse around muzzles has become a major challenge for The Muzzle Up! Project’s mission — even from those who support it.\n“A lot of what I do involves watching what goes on online in the dog world surrounding muzzles, dog ownership, and dog training. People post what they are doing or how they are training, and then the comment section is just everyone fighting amongst one another. Criticism leads to defensiveness, and someone who is defensive is not receptive to any information being provided,” McManaman explains, before advising that kindness is the best way to advocate for fearful or aggressive dogs and the use of muzzles.\nShe adds: “We were all once a person who didn’t know about muzzles and assumed that they were only for aggressive dogs or that a muzzled dog has an awful life. We know that those things aren’t true so we need to lead by example,” she implores.\nHelp Beat the Stigma\nMcManaman practices what she preaches with her own pets. Neither of her dogs technically need to be muzzled but both have experience with the training for the device. “Why? Because all dogs can benefit from having been conditioned to wear a muzzle,” she explains. “There are so many uses beyond just aggression that responsible dog ownership also includes proactively training your dog to wear a muzzle.“\nPlus, one of her two pups is a Pit Bull and Rottweiler mix — giving McManaman a unique insight into one of the more complex muzzle battles.\n“I think Pit Bull owners have a harder time coming to terms with muzzling their dog. They are already having to deal with the stigma of the breed and a lot of people who talk to me don’t want to muzzle their bully breeds out of fear that they may look mean or dangerous,” she explains. Thanks to decadesof poor media representationresulting in negative public perceptions, Pit Bulls have long faced breed discrimination.\nFor Pittie owners, McManaman recommends fighting the urge to protect your dog’s image in favor of allowing them the convenience of looking like NBA player Richard Hamilton. “Let’s make one thing clear: Muzzles are for all breeds. Every dog can benefit from muzzle training and every dog has the propensity to bite,” she states.\nIf you want to get involved with Muzzle Up and support its mission, McManaman says there are few things more impactful and encouraging than using your own voice and platform: “Every time you post a video of your dog enjoying their day while wearing a muzzle, even if that only impacts one person, you are headed in the right direction. People need to see that muzzled dogs are happy, fulfilled, and living their best lives. The only way they are going to see that is if people are putting out the videos and pictures of that happening.”",

The holiday should be a their favorite! Unfortunately, as many pet parents know, all that food and all those humans can often spell disaster for your dog.\nThe goal is to set your pup up for success by making it easy for them to do the right thing and not get into trouble. There aresomany temptations on this day of feasting, but with a little advance planning, you can avoid the common horror of having your dog partake in the wrong part of the festivities.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails.

It can take months (sometimes years) to train a dog toexhibit exemplary behaviorin a crowded environment rife with distractions and delicious smells. My advice here is not about training, but rather, setting your dog up for success even if you haven’t spent their whole life preparing for this moment.\nTo be honest, Thanksgiving is such a random day that you are probably better off devoting your training to teaching your dog how to handle day-to-day events and just managing the challenges of this once-a-year holiday. Here’s some advice on Thanksgiving with dogs.\n1. Get Some Exercise\nHelp your dog achieve the right emotional state by giving them lots of exercise in the morning, before your guests arrive. It’s hard to find the time for a long walk, hike, or run, but you will reap the benefits all day if your pup achieves the relaxed, contented state that exercise brings. Some training for the sake of mental exercise can also help them be their best selves the rest of the day.

Create Separation\nSet up a barrier to prevent your dog from being in the kitchen while you cook and in the dining room when you are feasting. Simplypreventing troublecan feel like a cop out, but it’s a good solution as long as your dog can tolerate the separation. If your dog is comfortable in a crate or another room, take advantage. For many dogs, being separated is a reasonable way to stop them from begging,jumping up for food or stealing itfrom the serving area.\n3. Provide Stimulation\nStockpile some new toys and treats ready for use as you prepare and celebrate your Thanksgiving meal. If you can keep your dog interested in anything other than the delicious smells coming from the oven (and the garbage can!), you are setting them up for success. Stuff some Kongs or other food extraction toys ahead of time that you can give your dog to keep them occupied.\nConsiderfreezing a couple Kongsso that they will last even longer. Plan to give them at least one toy stuffed with goodies while you cook and another while you eat. If they have has something really appetizing to chew on or lick, it makes it easier for them to deal with not receiving the human food. That applies to dogs who are in a crate in another room, or with everyone.\nTwo words: Endless entertainment.\n4. Clean Up After\nWrap the leftovers up and put them in the fridge or freezer as fast as possible after you are done eating. With possible temptations secured and out of reach, the risk of trouble is largely behind you. Don’t forget to put the garbage out, too. A Thanksgiving trash party for your pup will rob you of some of those feelings of gratitude the day inspires, and even worse, it may be harmful to your dog’s health.\n5. Exercise...Again\nTake a walk after the big meal (this is good for humans and dogs regardless.) Theexercise is wonderful, especially after a large meal, and the chance to be outside makes most pups content. After any potential holiday stresses caused by visitors or the unusual nature of the day, a walk will be most welcome. If your dog is not used to a walk at that time, it’s a special treat. If they’re used to going out at that time, sticking to this part of her routine is a relief. Plus it’s time to reflect on how grateful you are for each other.\nHelpful tips on shaping up with your dog.",

  "page_content": "The puppy was leaping all over the adult dog — batting the older dog’s ears, crawling across their neck, nudging their muzzle and generally acting like they had no idea that the older dog might prefer to rest after their long play session. It’s the kind of scene I’d heard people describe countless times, but this client had video. As we watched, she said, “See, my older dog was so sweet to my puppy. They could do anything to her and my older pup would just let them.”\nBut then the story took a turn: “It’s different now. Sometimes they have so much fun, but other times, my older dog growls at my puppy, or evennipstheir nose,” she told me, clearly bewildered.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nIn a more recent video, the adult dog was indeed growling and baring their teeth at the exuberant youngster (who had grown significantly) after the younger dog pounced on the older dog’s head. The younger dog immediately stopped and scuttled away. Though the dramatic difference between these two scenes distressed my client, she felt better when I explained that this new development in her dogs’ interactions was completely normal.\nThe Dynamic Between Adult and Teenage Dogs\nWell-socialized, stable, adult dogs typically indulge puppies, allowing them to get away with just about anything. They offer no objection to a young pup who slams into them while they’re resting, walks over them or takes the toy they are playing with.\nBut when the puppy reaches early adolescence at five or six months, the adult dog will often react differently. This change is not only normal — it’s desirable. There’s no better way for a young dog to learn some manners than to have a socially skilled adult dog set clear boundaries.\nAs I told my client, the relationship between the adult and the younger dog wasn’t in trouble — rather, it was just that the little guy’s “puppy license” had expired. The older dog was letting the younger dog know that jumping on their head would not be tolerated, and that invitations to play must be offered politely by play-bowing or presenting a toy. Relieved, the woman said that when the puppy did this, the adult dog usually played with them.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nEssentially, the puppy had reached the age at which other dogs were inclined to let him know what would and would not be allowed. Humans also do this boundary-setting. When a baby grabs at earrings or pokes an adult in the eye, the adult’s response is minimal. But a seven-year-old who does this is likely to receive instruction on appropriate behavior. Ideally, such instruction is given kindly and fairly to young humans and young dogs alike.\nIt’s reasonable for an adult dog to warn a puppy with a quick growl or a highly inhibited nip, but not okay for the adult to attack or scare the puppy. Dogs who allow puppies to have their way with them probably have enough self-control to set appropriate limits with an adolescent, and are unlikely to be too rough and overdo it. That said, generalizations aren’t always true, and a young dog should be protected from excessive force, however unexpected. It’s not good for a youngster to be frightened or hurt, even mildly, by an adult dog teaching them manners.\nConversely, it’s not good for that dog to spend tons of time with an adult dog who doesn’t set limits. They never learn that other dogs expect them to behave with more decorum, which means they won’t have opportunities to practice making good choices and inhibiting objectionable behavior. Worse, when they interact with other adult dogs, some may correct them harshly, or even attack them.\nHaving been told that an adult dog’s behavior is not a problem, the client’s response is often one of relief, followed by the question: “Why didn’t anybody warn me?” It’s a fair question.\nThe answer is that you probably don’t think about age as having much of an effect on dogs’ behavior. Sure, there are a few exceptions: Most people realize that puppies can’t control their bladders as long as adult dogs (even ifhouse-trainingis progressing well and the pup seems to grasp the basic idea that the bathroom is outside). It’s also generally accepted that dogs in their golden years tire more easily (so that strenuous, three-hourhikeshould be reconsidered).\nHowever, the situations in which dogs’ behavior is influenced by their age far outnumber those in which their age is taken into account. This discrepancy creates the possibility of misunderstandings and frustration, which are counterproductive to developing and enjoying a close relationship. In fact, relationships between people and dogs can be tested during adolescence, and it’s no coincidence that dogs are the most vulnerable to being surrendered to shelters and rescues at this stage.\nThe Dog “Teenage” Phase: What to Expect\nJust like human adolescents, dogs can have a mild or extreme experience with their teenage years. As a pet parent, the “teen” period can be a shock, since it comes right on the heels of the adorable-puppy stage. Sure, during a dog’s puppyhood, there are usually some accidents and interrupted sleep, but your puppy’s cuteness largely distracts you from viewing this as a terrible part of dog parenthood. People are rarely blindsided by the trials and tribulations of puppyhood — nobody is surprised by the occasional chewed-up shoe.\nNot so in adolescence. This is the time when many of the kindest, most patient dog parents in the world are left wondering where their sweet puppy has gone. There’s an understandable urge to say, “Who is this monster, and what have they done with my dog?”\nPeople are often surprised by the sudden independence of their adolescent dog. The lovable pup who always wanted to be with you and gleefully dashed to your side at the “Come!” cue now seems not to hear you. There’s no reaction — none at all, not even an ear twitch. Sigh. The perfect recall that brought you such pride seems to have disappeared. The same dog who loved to lie down when asked now looks at you as though considering their options: “Hmm, is that really what I want to do right now?” Often, teenage dogs seem to have forgotten everything you worked so hard to teach them.\nDon’t panic when you see a training slump in early adolescence; it’s a common, and temporary, phenomenon. The work you’ve put in with your puppy will pay off later. The well-trained, responsive puppy is likely to mature into a well-trained, responsive adult, even if the adolescent in between bears little resemblance to either. As professional baseball player Earl Wilson said, “Snow and adolescence are the only problems that disappear if you ignore them long enough.”\nBesides behaving like classic human teenagers, it’s common foradolescent dogs to become more fearfulthan they were as puppies. At around six to 10 months, some dogs suddenly act timid in situations that they’ve been comfortable with in the past. New people, loud sounds, or going to a newparkmay cause a dog to hang back, hesitate, or startle.\nMild cases of this “juvenile-onset shyness” are just a phase, and many dogs pass through it no worse for wear. (This is in sharp contrast to dogs who are truly fearful. Dogs don’t simply outgrow this kind of fear, but with knowledge, patience and hard work on their humans’ part, they can overcome it.)\nThough many dogs move past juvenile-onset shyness without assistance, it’s wise to be proactive in helping a dog through this challenging period by associating whatever triggers the response with something that the dog loves. For example, if an eight-month-old dog suddenly seems nervous when a man approaches, I would pair that approach with something the dog adores, such as a ball or the best treats ever. This conditioning goes a long way toward preventing shyness from escalating into a deeper fear.\nMany behavioral differences are predictably related to age, with especially big changes occurring during adolescence. They’re easier to handle if you recognize these changes for what they are: a normal part of development. You naturally do this with humans, but often fail to give the same courtesy to dogs. Adult dogs understand the change from puppyhood to adolescence and react accordingly. Perhaps the best course of action is to follow their lead.",

  },
  "page_content": "As kids, we were taught to ask permission before petting a dog with some variation of “May I please meet your dog?” As adults, we have T-shirts and hats that say, “Tell your dog I said ‘hi.’” But when did we start thinking it was OK to excitedly approach a dog with a big ol’ pet on the head, sans warning?\nDo we, as humans, especially after years of social distancing, love a non-consensual pat on the head (seriously, who would do that?) or hug? No. We like to be asked. And so do dog parents who are out in public with their pups.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nRead Between the Lines\nThis simple question has the potential to avoid unpleasant interactions, but only if kids (and adults) are taught how to interpret the possible answers, especially those that are nuanced. The answer might be a simple “Yes.” It could also be a straightforward “No“ for any number of reasons: It’s not safe to pet the dog, the dog will feel uncomfortable if the child attempts to interact, or even that someone is on a tight schedule and doesn’t have time for a meet-and-greet. The person may also seem hesitant but not actually say “No” or give an answer that conveys serious concern.The clear “Yes” answers are easy to figure out. It’s common for people to reply to a request to meet a dog with some variant of “Sure, she loves people!” “He would love that!” or “Absolutely; thanks for asking!” In that case, there is a good chance that the person expects a positive interaction between a person and a dog. They might be wrong, but there’s no sense of worry or concern being expressed, which is encouraging, and it makes sense for people to approach the dog.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nSimilarly, a definite “No” from the person is also clear. If a person declines the request, people should respect that and not approach the dog. Common ways that people prevent an interaction are by saying, “I’m sorry, but people make her nervous,” “She’s too shy; it will upset her,” or “I think maybe no, because everything scares her.” They might even say, “No, because she’ll try to bite you.” People who answer in this general way know that the dog can’t handle it and that it would be a mistake to let someone meet her.\nUnfortunately, there are two general categories of answers that can be ambiguous, and too few children have been taught to understand them. The first set of such answers is generally positive with mild reservations. These usually indicate that the people are not concerned about their dog being aggressive, but they feel embarrassed about some aspect of their dog. These replies are along the lines of, “OK, but she’s very excitable,” or “Yes, but she may jump on you.”\nSometimes, people just offer a warning that is not behavioral, such as “If you don’t mind getting a lot of fur on you!” In most cases, these responses are not deal breakers. If the person expresses that their dog is unruly or shedding, it’s OK to answer, “I don’t mind dog hair,” or “I don’t think jumping up will put a dark blot on her character!” Just consider whether the dog is not so powerful or out of control that someone could get knocked over. This requires a judgment call, and the most conservative approach is to choose not to meet dogs after such replies. At the very least, proceed with caution.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a shy pup to go from wallflower to social butterfly.\nAnother set of answers can be more worrisome, and people need to learn that they should not pet a dog if the dog’s parent says things along the lines of, “That wouldprobablybe OK,” or “Well, she’s shy, but we can see how she does,” or “If she’ll let you. I’m not sure because sometimes she can’t handle it.” All of these replies show that a person is in the hope-and-fear zone. (“I hope it will be OK, but I fear that it will not be.”) There is a great risk that the interaction could not end well for the person or the dog.\nGood Rules of Thumb\nKids, who can often scare dogs, should be taught that the correct action upon hearing such remarks is not to approach the dog. A simple, “Oh, that’s OK. I wouldn’t want to upset her, but thanks anyway,” is a good phrase to use in those situations.There are endless possible answers when a person asks, “May I please meet your dog?” The “Yes” and the “No” replies are easy to understand. The former tells you it’s likely to be a positive interaction and the latter lets you know that the person knows the dog can’t handle it and has clearly said so. It’s those intermediate answers that require more careful interpretation. If the answer gives any hint that it might not go well or might distress the dog, it’s best to decline.\nWith patience and positive reinforcement, you can do a lot to make up for lost time with socialization.\nOf course, all of this general advice assumes that people have the right read on their dog, and that is not always the case. They may think the dog loves all people, even when the dog’s body language reveals that they are terrified and wants someone to go away. That’s why it’s still important for passersby to learn how to tell that a dog is behaving in a fearful and/or threatening way.\nDog parents’ responses to a request to meet a dog are only one stream of information we can use to decide whether to approach a dog. Still, there’s often a lot of truth in what they say, which is why we should evaluate those responses and act accordingly.",

  "page_content": "Helen’s dog, Benny, was super well behaved, an all-around ambassador to his species, and as every high-achieving student can identify with, “a pleasure to have in class.” Benny was the exemplary kind of dog who chose to rest his head gently on the one child with developmental disabilities when he visited classrooms, could be trusted to keep his paws and mouth to himself at a party where the potluck items wereon the floor or low tables, never barked, and slept throughthunderstorms. He was, in short, quite unusual.\nAs the instructor of his intermediate training class and of his tricks and games class, I could see that he was as easy a dog to train as any I have ever met, and he probably would have been a delightful companion, largely devoid of bad habits, without any training. He was one of those rare dogs who can make any trainer look good. Helen didn’t understand that Benny was a bit of an outlier until after he died, and she adopted her next dog, Miro.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nMiro was, by no means, difficult as dogs go, but he was quite typical and different from Benny. He was a little tricky topotty trainbut not overly challenging. Hechewed,barked,jumped on people, was mouthy,counter-surfed, searched purses for snacks, andpulled on a leashenough to make walking him unpleasant. As much as Helen might have wanted to look inward and say: “OK, so,whatam I doing wrong?,” the truth, in this case, wasnothing. They can definitely respond to training, but all dogs are innately individual.\nDogs Are Who They Are\nI wish everyone understood the individuality of dogs and what that means when it comes to their behavior. Helen learned that lesson, but not every dog parent even knows they need to. Even unlimited love and training won’t turn a dog with impulse-control challenges, high-arousal issues, orfearfulnessinto a dog who is a good match to be aservice dog.\nToo many people are being told that if they would just train their dog better or reinforce them more, they could turn their dog into whatever sort of dog they desire, but I don’t believe that. This line of reasoning does a lot of harm to people; it makes them feel like failures, which is unfair. A dog parent might have trained their pup beautifully, but each dog responds differently to the same amount of and approach to training.\nRenowned animal behaviorist Patricia McConnell, PhD, on what it takes to be a great therapy dog.\nThankfully, many trainers understand the importance of each dog’s individuality. For every dog who professional trainers can trust off leash in any setting, there is a dog who can only be given such freedom in limited situations. Not all dogs are capable of being demo dogs for training classes. But, when many trainers are referencing the dogs who taught them the most, they usually bring up their most challenging dog, not the straight-A student.\nPatience — and Understanding — Is Key\nYears ago, I had a dog who didn’t learn very fast. It would frequently take me weeks, or even months, to teach him something that I would teach my clients’ dogs in one or two sessions. I knew that his speed of acquiring new skills was not an indictment of my training skills; I could clearly train some dogs with much less effort. It was just a fact that my dog was not a quick study, but someone who didn’t know that might have criticized me if they’d seen our slow progress.\nYour pup is special simply because they’re your baby. Remember, their personality, and their response to training, is just as unique. Not every dog is capable of handlinglarge parties, off leash walks in the woods, or childrentrying to hug them, even with lots of training. Some struggle to control their mouths, to keep their barking in check, or to keep all four paws on the floor when greeting anyone. Yes,of coursetraining can lead to improvement in all these behaviors, but some dogs take to the training like naturals and others don’t.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nAccept Your Pup For Who They Are\nSure, it’s a good goal to try to expand the variety of situations theycanhandle with training and behavioral modification, but you wouldn’t want to change who they are at their core — and it doesn’t make sense to try. The variation among dogs (whether the main cause is genetic, a result of earlier life experiences, or the usual mix of these two factors) can’t be undone by training. Forcing your pup to exist in an environment that makes them uncomfortable, or that they can’t handle, won’t do either of you any good.\nNo matter if you have a dog like Benny, one like Miro, or a dog with truly serious behavioral issues, it’s important to accept them for who they are, just as we would want anyone to do for us. So, here’s your charge: Recognize that who your pup is has a lot to do with who they are when they came into your life. And, whoever that is is absolutely perfect in every way — before and after training.",

  "page_content": "As a dog trainer, I field a lot of questions about “littermate syndrome.” This email described a familiar scenario: “We were planning to adopt one puppy, but the breeder said that raising two sisters would be easier. After we brought the girls home at nine weeks, their behavior became increasingly out of control. My husband and I could not get their attention for more than a second or two — it was as if we weren’t even in the same room. And then they started displaying alarming fearfulness of people and other dogs.” I made an appointment for a home visit so I could meet the family and the puppies.\nMany factors influence behavior, and not all siblings raised together will exhibit this problem, which is called “littermate syndrome.” In other words, it’s a risk, not a foregone conclusion.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nThat said, many dog behaviorists, trainers, breeders, and shelters actually discourage adopting siblings. Anecdotal evidence suggests that behavioral issues may arise during key development periods because the two puppies’ deep bond impedes their individual ability to absorb and grasp the nuances of human and canine communication. Because fear is the dog’s default reaction to odd or unfamiliar stimuli, this muddled understanding of the world around them can lead to impaired coping mechanisms later on.\nKeep reading to learn what is littermate syndrome, exactly, plus how to spot it and prevent it in the first place.\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nWhat is littermate syndrome?\nLittermate syndrome is a term that describes unwanted behaviors among sibling dogs, including aggression and intense attachment. It is often used to describe behavioral issues that occur when two or more dogs from the same litter are raised together and adopted into the same home.\nIf you are considering adopting two puppies from the same litter, it is important to do your research and understand the risks of littermate syndrome. By taking steps to prevent it, you can help your puppies develop into well-adjusted and well-behaved dogs.\nSigns of littermate syndrome\nSo, how can you tell if your pups have littermate syndrome? Signs may include:\nFearfulness of unfamiliar people, dogs, and other novel stimuli (aka, neophobia)\nFearfulness of unfamiliar people, dogs, and other novel stimuli (aka, neophobia)\nIntense anxiety when separated, even briefly\nIntense anxiety when separated, even briefly\nDifficulty learning basic obedience skills\nDifficulty learning basic obedience skills\nIncessant fighting with each other\nIncessant fighting with each other\nPerveterinarian and dog behaviorist Dr. Ian Dunbar: “It’s a disaster waiting to happen for the littermates because they don’t get socialized to other dogs or people, let alone to their owners.” Dr. Dunbar says that any pet parents assume that the dogs’ interactions with one another are adequate, “but when the puppies are five or six months old and meet an unfamiliar dog in a novel setting, they absolutely freak out.”\nDunbar points out that raising littermates requirestraining two puppies, which is particularly challenging when they’re essentially wearing blinders to all but each other. “It’s more than twice the work; it’s exponential. The two combine to produce levels of energy that we can barely measure,” he says. “Tension develops in training and compliance as they squeeze the human out of the relationship. They’re always living with an enormous distraction: each other.”\nWant help with your pet's behavior right now? Get answers 24/7 with Kinship Premium.\nQuestion or concern about your pet’s behavior? Subscribe now and connect with licensed experts immediately. For under $5/month.\nCertified Applied Animal Behaviorist Patricia B. McConnell, PhD is also against taking in littermates: “They are so busy playing with each other (or squabbling), that you become the odd man out... It seems harder to get theirattention, harder to teach them emotional control, and harder to teach themboundaries,” she says. “I have seen some nasty cases of bullying or outright aggression between dogs of the same litter, and it feels as though it is more common than between dogs who come into the family from different litters.”\nWhat are the risks associated with littermate syndrome?\nWhen it comes to the dangers of littermate syndrome, the main one is this: Littermates may become so emotionally dependent on each other that even short separations provoke extreme distress. Behavior specialist and authorNicole Wilderecalls a case in which two, nine-year-old sibling Huskies attended her group class. “They were so bonded to each other that I literally could not take one and walk a few feet away to practice loose-leash skills because the other would scream.”\nWilde believes the problem is rooted in hyper-attachment, which leads to hindered social development and communication issues: “People assume that having two same-age pups who play together and interact constantly covers their dog-dog socialization needs, but they, in fact, don’t learn how other [dogs] play and have no idea about social skills with other puppies, adolescents, or adult dogs. Perhaps one puppy is a bit of a bully, which their littermate puts up with, but their rude behavior might not be tolerated by a new dog in a new setting.”\nHow to tell the difference between dog aggression and communication.\nDuring my appointment with the family, we determined that the best course was torehomeone of the 12-week-old siblings. Dunbar agrees that it’s often best to separate littermates, especially if symptoms appear early, so that each has a chance to develop normally as an individual. This is obviously a tough decision for the overwhelmed pet parent to make, a sort of canineSophie’s Choice.Dunbar recommends that potential new owners meet both puppies and determine which to take home.\nCan littermate syndrome be prevented?\nIf you're committed to raising a pair of littermates, you should ensure that the puppies spend significant portions of every day apart so each learns how to be alone — a key lesson in any well-thought-out puppy program. This meansfeeding,walking, and training each puppy separately, with individual crates in different parts of the home. Even trips to puppy socials and the vet should be separate, so they learn to incorporate these episodes into their respective psyches without being overly dependent on their littermate. (Yes, this can be time-consuming, exhausting, and defeat the original intent of adopting siblings.)\nWilde notes that planned separations must begin immediately. “I’ve been called into homes where four-month-old siblings have been sleeping in the same crate for eight weeks and not purposefully separated by the owners, who had the best intentions but were unaware of littermate issues. Even getting the puppies to sleep in separate crates right next to each other is traumatic for them.”\nCompression vests, interactive toys, and pheromone sprays will be game-changers this Fourth of July.\nDunbar, too, is adamant that one of the key lessons a puppy must master is how to be content with being alone, which is all but impossible with two siblings. “Once we’ve done that, yes, they can live with other dogs and have free run of the house. But if you don’t teach puppies early on how to be alone, and especially with siblings who have always been together, it will be catastrophic when one dies.” Dunbar encouragesmultiple dog households, but the timing, temperament, and age that each enters the home is paramount.\nAt the end of the day, the best littermate syndrome prevention might be to avoid adopting siblings in the first place. Most people have never heard of littermate syndrome, finding out about it while researching their dogs’ problematic behaviors. Increasingly, however, trainers and behavior professionals recognize that the cons of adopting siblings far outweigh the pros. “The only advantage I can think of is a short-term gain of the puppies being less lonely in the first month of life,” says Dunbar. “Everything else is a loss.”\nLittermate expectations — and hope\nWhile there are indeed struggles in raising siblings — including ongoing dog aggression and fighting often seen between same-sex littermates — there are also well-adjusted cohabitating pairs. A common thread seems to be that littermates are more likely to thrive when introduced into a household with an older dog, who perhaps acts as an arbiter and stabilizing influence.\nDouble the trouble or double the fun?\nMyriad factors affect dog behavior, including genetics, early life experiences, and human engagement. As University of California, Davis, veterinary behaviorist Dr. Melissa Bain points out, “Two fearful littermates very well may be genetically predisposed to fear.” Bain is less inclined to apply the termsyndrometo the set of symptoms. “It makes you think all littermates have problems, which is not the case.”\nShe also emphasizes that the level of human involvement is key, saying, “The symptoms escalate when pet parents treat them as one dog with eight legs.” When conflict ensues between the pair, Bain believes it’s because the dogs are similar in size, age, and gender. “This uniformity makes it difficult for the siblings to delineate a hierarchy,” she says.\nIn the case of the family I was working with, after one of the siblings had been re-homed, the remaining puppy began to thrive under a remedial socialization program. In an email, her human wrote: “Dora has blossomed in the last three months into a delightful household companion, and she continues to improve. She now approaches people out of curiosity. We know she would still be fearful had we not separated the two before it got any worse. Dora has become more confident with all kinds of dogs, and successfully completed a group obedience class.”\nIf they’re following you around like your shadow, there’s a reason for that.\nIncreasing awareness of littermate issues\nRecognition of the risks of dual adoption appears to be spreading, with many shelters declining to place siblings together. Shelley Smith, adoption center manager atPets Unlimitedin San Francisco, says her shelter stopped placing siblings together after a particularly disturbing case. “A Dachshund mix named Thelma was returned to the shelter because her sibling repeatedly attacked her; she had multiple injuries by the time the heartbroken family returned her to us. Thankfully, we were able to rehome Thelma, but it’s almost certain the fighting and anxiety could have been avoided had the two littermates not been placed together. We now separate siblings and inform adopters about the rationale for our policy.”\nWhile siblings blessed with extraordinary genes and socialization-forward pet parents may avoid littermate syndrome, the consensus among canine professionals is that it’s not worth the risk. Most would encourage people to adopt a single puppy who suits their lifestyle and to focus on the training and socialization that strengthens the interspecies bond unique to humans and dogs. Once your puppy is a dog, by all means, get a second; the two will be at completely different stages, and the older one may very well emerge as a great life teacher to the younger.\nFAQ (People also ask):\nLittermate syndrome can be managed by separating the pups as much as possible — especially during training, feeding, walking, and even sleeping (individual crates in different parts of the home are a good idea).\nLittermate syndrome is not a myth. While there aren’t scientific studies to support it, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence to show it's a real phenomenon.\nLittermate syndrome starts as soon as you bring two puppies home together when they’re around eight to 10 weeks old.\nReferences\nThere’s No Scientific Reason to Believe Littermate Syndrome Exists\nThere’s No Scientific Reason to Believe Littermate Syndrome Exists\nSocial Behavior of Dogs\nSocial Behavior of Dogs",

The influence of age on behavior is not often taken into account, and that makes adolescence a surprise to many people. It’s only a phase, and that’s worth remembering when you find yourself dealing with the inevitable misunderstandings and frustrations of life with an adolescent dog. Forgetting this stage is only a temporary phase will be counterproductive to developing and enjoying a close relationship. In fact, relationships between people and dogs can be tested during adolescence, and it’s no coincidence that dogs are the most vulnerable to being surrendered to shelters and rescues at this stage.\nWith patience and positive reinforcement, you can do a lot to make up for lost time with socialization.\nWhat are the life stages of a dog?\nThe dog lifespan encompasses a number of dog life stages. For the first six to eight months of life, they are puppies. Then from six to eight months until about the age of 18 months to two years, they are adolescents. From that point until they are 75 percent into their expected life span (which varies by size and breed of dog), they are adult dogs. For the last 25 percent of their expected lifespan, they are considered senior dogs, when they are also said to be in their golden years, or referred to as “gray hairs”.\nThe adolescent years for dogs are the end of their first year until somewhere between halfway and fully through their second year of life. Sometimes, people refer to “puppy adolescence,” but the adolescent phase is a separate time of life that comes after the puppy phase. The dog adolescent ages are the ones that many people find the most challenging.That is saying something because the puppy phase is the one that usually involves potty messes and sleep deprivation, yet it is still not as hard for most people as the adolescent phase.\nThose little razor teeth are no fun.\nThe dynamic between adult and adolescent dogs\nAdult dogs respond differently to dogs of other ages, so dog life stage matters to dogs, too, and not just to people. Some adult dogs are afraid of puppies, or even disinterested, but it’s common for stable and well-adjusted full-grown dogs to have an attitude and behavior toward puppies that is best described as indulgent. Many adult dogs let puppies crawl all over them, bite or bat at their tail and ears, take their toys, and disturb them no matter what they are doing.\nBut then the “puppy license” wears off when the puppy reaches early adolescence, and dogs are less likely to tolerate certain behavior from young dogs. They are very clear about what is acceptable and what is not, and they set clear boundaries. Adults shouldn’t be too rough, and usually aren’t, but some adolescents do become alarmed by the sudden change in the behavior toward them by adult dogs.\nThis change involves adult dogs who react very differently. It’s not only normal — it’s desirable. There’s no better way for a young dog to learn some manners than to have a socially skilled adult dog set clear boundaries.\nHumans also do this boundary-setting. When a baby grabs at earrings or pokes an adult in the eye, the adult’s response is minimal. But a seven-year-old who does this is likely to receive instruction on appropriate behavior. Ideally, such instruction is given kindly and fairly to young humans and young dogs alike.\nInternationally renowned dog trainer Victoria Stilwell's tips for training pushy puppies.\nThe dog adolescent phase: What to expect\nWhen your dog enters adolescence, expect behavioral changes. It’s completely normal for them to act differently as they enter the transitional period between puppyhood and adulthood. Transitions of any kind are hard, and this is true with developing dogs.\nJust like human adolescents, dogs can have a mild or extreme experience with their transitional years. As a pet parent, this period can be a shock, since it comes right on the heels of the adorable-puppy stage. Sure, during a dog’s puppyhood, there are usually some accidents and interrupted sleep, but your puppy’s cuteness largely distracts you from viewing this as a terrible part of dog parenthood. People are rarely blindsided by the trials and tribulations of puppyhood — nobody is surprised by the occasional chewed-up shoe.\nNot so in adolescence. This is the time when many of the kindest, most patient dog parents in the world are left wondering where their sweet puppy has gone. There’s an understandable urge to say, “Who is this monster, and what have they done with my dog?”\nIt’s likeWhat to Expect When You’re Expecting, except add“four little paws to run around your house”to the title.\nWhat behavioral changes can I expect during dog adolescence?\nPeople are often surprised by the sudden independence of their adolescent dog. Gone is the shadow pup whose first choice of where to be was always right next to you. Dogs emerging from the puppy stage tend toexplore more, wander further from you than they used to, and care less about keeping you in sight.\nIt’s hard to see your dog acting independently like this because it can feel like they don’t need you — or even as if they don’t love you as much. Don’t let it get you down; despite these behavioral changes, your dog loves and needs you just as much as ever, but also likes to do their own thing and follow their nose. (I don’t know who needs to read this again, but your dog still loves and needs you.)\nOften, adolescent dogs seem to have forgotten everything you worked so hard to teach them. They ignore cues, respond to them more slowly, or act as though they forget what some of them mean at all. I know it’s difficult, but don’t take it personally. What feels like a training setback is completely normal in adolescence, so try not to settle into gloom and doom or feel like all is lost. Your puppy is just growing up, and this, too, shall pass.Even if you know to expect it (and especially if you don’t), it can be quite a shock the first time your adolescent dog acts like they didn’t even hear you at all. It’s demoralizing, after months of enjoying your gleeful puppy running to you when you cheerily call out, “Come!”, to see no such enthusiasm. You gave the cue just like you have so many times before, you’re all ready to reinforce your dog with greattreatsor a chase game, and what happens? There’s no reaction — none at all, not even an ear twitch. Sigh. That perfect recall that brought you such pride seems to have disappeared.\nIf it’s time for a round of shots (no, not that kind), follow this guide.\nThe same dog who sat in a heartbeat when asked now looks at you as though considering their options: “Yeah, I heard you, but I’m simply not interested in doing that right now.” Don’t be surprised if you give a cue your dog knows well, and the response is a blank look as though they’re completely unfamiliar with this cueorthe behavior associated with it.\nDon’t panic when you see a training slump in early adolescence; it’s a common — and temporary — phenomenon. The work you’ve put in with your puppy will pay off later. The well-trained, responsive puppy is likely to mature into a well-trained, responsive adult, even if the adolescent in between bears little resemblance to either. As professional baseball player Earl Wilson said, “Snow and adolescence are the only problems that disappear if you ignore them long enough.”\nAs dogs approach the one-year mark, many temporarily become morefearful. Dogs who begin to act skittish or nervous but were previously confident are probably entering this developmentally normalfear period. They may shy away from people with hats or sunglasses. A toddler shrieking and running towards them may prompt your dog to run the other way.\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nMost dogs move past this fear period without any lasting effects, just as kids stop being afraid of monsters under the bed once they move past that developmental stage. We can help all our dogs cope better by staying calm, resisting the urge to panic, and talking to the dog in a cheerful way. Don’t force them to approach or interact with anything or anyone that unnerves them, and pair up their triggers with something that makes them happy such as great treats or toys.\nSome sweet adult dogs indulge puppies by doing nothing when the little one nibbles on their ears or bats at their nose, takes their toy or uses their tail like one, or tries to play when the adult dog is clearly ready for a snooze. When the puppy approaches adolescence, the adult dog is likely to let their young friend know that this behavior is no longer acceptable, perhaps growling if the younger dog is being a pest, using their paw to swat at them, or even nipping with a gentle bite over their muzzle.\nMost young dogs quickly learn what is allowed and what is not. An adult dog who gently offers young dogs a good social education is an asset. “Gently” is a crucial word here. It’s essential that the adult strike the right balance — firm but not rough. The adult dog should be guiding the younger one, never scaring or hurting them, but simply letting them know there are new expectations about how to act now.\nTips you’ll want to pay attention to.\nMany behavioral differences are predictably related to age, with especially big changes occurring during adolescence. They’re easier to handle if you recognize these changes for what they are: a normal part of development. We naturally do this with humans, but often fail to give the same courtesy to dogs. Adult dogs understand the change from puppyhood to adolescence and react accordingly. Perhaps the best course of action is to follow their lead.\nHow can I handle my dog’s changing adolescent behavior?\nIt takes patience and an adjustment of expectations to handle your adolescent dog’s challenging behaviors. Being patient here really just means giving your dog a lot of grace and remembering that adolescence is temporary but the love you share is forever. Dogs at this age have busy brains, and they are easily distracted. They are not ignoring you on purpose, but they are so tuned in to the world around them and they simply don’t have the bandwidth to give you the attention you became accustomed to in the puppy stage and that you will see again as they mature.\nHow to teach your pup to play nice.\nMany adolescent dog behavior problems are a simple result of a dog exploring their new world with more confidence and excitement than they had as a puppy. Remembering that your dog is finding joy in the world can help you to accept who they are at this point in the dog lifespan. Then, when they enter the next of the dog life cycle stages (young adulthood) they will enter it with a parent whose patience and love has kept the relationship strong and growing stronger.\nReferences\nHow Old Is My Dog?

  "page_content": "Changing any behavior takes time, patience, and dedication. When dogs are feeling mischievous,anxious, or stressed, they can cause a lot of damage — chewing shoes,counter surfing, scratching,barking— the list of undesirable behaviors goes on. Animal shelters are filled withpets abandonedbecause people don’t realize the time and dedication required to train good manners. While there is rarely a quick fix for anything, regular exercise can provide a huge benefit. Even with well-trained dogs, exercise matters if you want good behavior.\nWhat should you do about destructive dog behaviors?\nTraining obviously helps with problem behaviors, but it’s not the only way to avoid trouble. Dog trainers have long valued the role of exercise in minimizing destructive dog behaviors such asbarking, chewing,jumpingaround, being unable to settle down or sleep well, digging, whining, and relentless attention-seeking.Studiesshow that more exercise was correlated with lower levels of fear, lessaggressiontoward familiar dogs, and reduced excitability.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nCelebrity dog trainer Victoria Stilwell’s pro tips for keeping paws off your charcuterie platter this holiday season.\nIn one study, a group of dogs was divided in half; one half worked on formal training while the other half had their exercise increased to two 30-to-45-minute sessions a day. After six weeks, the dogs who had additional training showed improvements in both their responsiveness to cues and their problem behaviors. The dogs who had extra exercise also exhibited problem behaviors less frequently, although their responsiveness to cues had not improved. So, how does exercise affect behavior through physiological means?\nHow does exercise improve dog behaviors?\nLike people, dogs can achieve an emotional state described as a “runner’s high,” which may be why your pup is so excited for the chance to go out on a run. It may also be why so many people believe the old saying, “A tired dog is a good dog.” But these well-behaved and well-exercised dogs may be more influenced by chemistry than by fatigue.\nA runner’s high is caused by chemicals called endocannabinoids, which signal the reward centers of the brain. Endocannabinoids lessen both pain and anxiety as well as create feelings of well-being. Running triggers higher levels of these compounds, which is why running makes people (and dogs) feel good.\nHelpful tips on shaping up with your dog.\nIf you’re laughing at the thought and can’t imagine putting yourself through the misery of running on purpose, you aren’t alone. While most dogs are excited aboutrunning, humans, on the other hand — outside of a small percentage — aren’t interested. Still, thepotentialto activate the chemicals that cause a runner’s high exists within you — even if you aren’t dipping into it as frequently as your long-ago ancestors, for whom running long distances was part of daily life.\nThis pleasurable, rewarding quirk of chemistry is not universal among mammals. In astudyinvestigating the phenomenon of the “runner’s high,” researchers predicted that running would result in pleasurable chemical reactions in species with a history of endurance running. They studied three types of mammals — humans, dogs, and ferrets — and found that the two with distance running in their evolutionary pasts (humans and dogs) exhibited elevated levels of one particular endocannabinoid (anandamide) after running on a treadmill. Ferrets, non-cursorial animals, had no such chemical response and derived no pleasure from it. (Now you might be wondering if you’re part ferret.)\nThis study says it’s actually less about what’sintheir DNA and more about what’sonit.\nA happy dog is a good dog.\nThe behavioral benefits of running may be related more to contentment than fatigue. Perhaps, what we call “tired” is actually better described as “happy,” “relieved of anxiety and pain,” and “experiencing feelings of well-being.” If so, exercise may indirectly benefit dogs’ behavior because itelevates moodrather than simply makes them too worn out to misbehave. Since endocannabinoids lessen the anxiety that can be a source of problem behaviors, it’s easy to see how exercise could help.\nRunning is also associated with the production of other chemicals that reduce anxiety in mammalian brains. Researchersreportedthat mice given the opportunity to run handled stress and anxiety better than sedentary mice. The study observed the brain activity in both groups of mice and found that runners had more excitable neurons in the ventral hippocampus — which plays a role in anxiety — than sedentary mice.\nHow to get your pet to stop chewing on inedibles from clothes to couches.\nThe active mice, however, also had more cells capable of producing the calming chemicals that inhibit activity in that area of the brain, which lessensanxiety. The study supports the idea that for mice, at least, running improves the regulation of anxiety through inhibitory activity in the brain. It is possible that the situation is similar in dogs, though without studying them specifically, we can’t know for sure.\nWhat does this mean for your dog?\nOf course, behavior and physiology, and the links between the two, are never completely straightforward. There is evidence that cannabinoids can cause hyperactivity at low doses, even though they have calming effects at higher doses.\nAge, breed, and individual differences play a role in theamount of exercise requiredto keep your dog’s halo on straight and prevent them from sprouting little horns, behaviorally speaking. Some dogs thrive on small amounts of exercise. For others, the same amount of exercise — perhaps a leash walk at a leisurely pace — has the opposite effect. It invigorates them and may actually induce hyperactivity. For example, for a dog that typically runs 60 to 70 miles a week, switching to shorter exercise sessions for one week (say during a vacation) might actually just amp them up.\nYou — yes you! — can be one of those fun people who runs with your dog. Just be smart about it.\nYour dog will also experience different effects from various amounts and types of exercise (running,hiking,swimming, playingtug, or fetch). When looking at ways to help reduce your dog’s destructive behaviors, you’ll need to find the right balance of training and exercise to help ensure that your pup is content.\nBesides the well-known physical benefits of exercise, its psychological and behavioral benefits are profound. Stopping annoying behaviors and increasing good behaviors make the beautiful relationship between people and dogs that much better. What more could you want for your dog than the highest quality of life, minimal anxiety, the most elevated feelings of contentedness, and the best possible relationship with you?",

  "page_content": "Why doesn’t my puppy like walks? He loves to play inside the house, but he doesn’t enjoy going on walks around the neighborhood. I often wind up picking him up and carrying him, but even that freaks him out. He seems more inclined to walk when the rest of the family is around, but not when it’s just the two of us. What can I do?\nDon’t stress — it’s not at all unusual for puppies to resist going on walks! The good news is most dogs get more enthusiastic about them as they get older. In the meantime, here are some things you can do to get your puppy moving:\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nUse a puppy-size collar and leash.\nSometimes, a dog’s resistance to walks relates to equipment. Many puppies freeze up a little when they wear a leash and collar because they’re not used to them. To help alleviate this roadblock, make sure that anycollar or harnessyou’re using fits well and is the right size. Puppy-size pups need puppy-size leashes and collars; for very small puppies, a cat leash may be the best option. Help them get accustomed to the walking gear by putting it on them inside the house. Then, play or do a little bit of training with them while they’re suited up.\nIf your puppy tries to wiggle free or back out of their collar or harness, definitely use a martingale collar. Also called no-slip or limited-slip collars, martingale collars are far safer and provide more control than typical flat collars. They look a lot like a flat collar, but have an extra loop of fabric with a D-ring attached which causes the collar to gently tighten when a pup pulls in the opposite direction — preventing escape.\nStart with short, slow walks.\nMake the walk manageable by setting reasonable expectations. Encourage your pup to go a short distance (even a few houses down the block), then return. Don’t push the pace — let your pup amble as slowly as they like. Many puppies’ walking skills improve with short, positive experiences; walks that are too long or too fast can overwhelm them.\nPro Karen London, PhD shares the most common dog training errors and how to correct them.\nWalk your pup somewhere familiar.\nSome dogs find walks intimidating because everything is new. One way to get them used to walking near your home is to drive the two of you a few houses away and then encourage them to walk home with you. Many dogs, especially puppies, are more enthusiastic walkers when the route is taking themtoa familiar place instead ofawayfrom that familiar place. (Don’t try this if your dogdislikes riding in the car.)\nPlant a hidden treasure.\nAnother way to help your pup become more excited about walking is to hide a toy or stuffedKongalong the route so they have the wonderful experience of finding a treasure. Do this periodically, varying the location, direction, and distance so you don’t end up with a dog who’s only interested in going one way.\nMake it a group activity.\nIf your puppy is more enthusiastic when other people are around, they must be pretty social. Maybe they don’t like to leave anyone behind, or they’re just more playful in a larger group. Try walking your pup with another person and another puppy to see if that makes them more eager to get moving. If it does, that may translate to greater willingness to walk when it’s just the two of you.\nUse the “stay” command.\nAsk your pup to stay, then release with “Okay!” and see if they bound forward. Many dogs are very enthusiastic to move at the end of a stay. If this works with your pup, you can use the technique a couple of times on a walk (but not too often, or it may stop being effective).\nPractice patience.\nThe most important thing I can recommend is that you be patient with your pup. Short, pressure-free walks may not be satisfying for you, but they will go a long way toward making your pup a more willing walker. On the flip side, pushing your pup too far, too fast may make them fearful — which is definitelynotthe goal.",

  },
  "page_content": "Lola is my five-month-old Shepherd / Labrador Retriever mix. We adopted her about a week ago from a foster home. She starts off great when we go on walks, but after about five minutes, she is constantly pulling and zig-zagging. I keep the leash all wrapped up so she has to walk next to me, but she still keeps pulling. Stopping and redirecting her doesn’t seem to work. The minute we start walking again, she starts to pull. I’m not sure what to do next. — Ines\nCongratulations on your adoption! Leash-pulling is a super common problem for dogs, especially puppies like Lola who are just learning how to walk on a leash. The good news is it sounds like Lola’s an eager, curious puppy — and with a little guidance, she can explore her new neighborhood safely and calmly.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nFirst, identify your dog’s motivation and remove distractions.\nThe first thing we need to do is identify what it is that’s motivating the behavior of pulling. It could be that a dog is fearful and overwhelmed by environmental stimuli, and they’re trying to escape. Alternately, it could be that they’re super jazzed tosniff around and explore their environment. In either case, we need to make staying by your side seem like the best option to your dog.\nDog trainer Karen B. London promises you’re not doomed to be pulled down the street forever.\nYou can do this using positive reinforcement, a.k.a. lots oftreats. Don’t be shy about the number of treats you give, because you can always fade food out of the equation over time. You might want to plan your training around Lola’s feeding schedule so that she has an empty stomach during training, and she’s extra motivated by food rewards. Use these high-value rewards in an environment where Lola is not distracted, whether that’s a yard or hallway or courtyard — anywhere your dog can pay full attention to you. Start where the dog can hear you and focus on you. Eventually, you can slowly increase the challenges present, bringing Lola to more and more distracting environments.\nAvoid following their pull, and avoid pulling back.\nAllowing a dog to pull and following them with tension on the leash just reinforces pulling. The dog learns that pressure on the neck means forward movement, which is what’s motivating their behavior. In other words: your dog wants to move forward, and if you move them forward when they pull, they’re gonna want to keep pulling.\nIf your pup acts diabolical on walks, you are not alone. Here’s what you can do.\nAt the same time, yanking your dog or correcting them could add stress, and we don’t want to add stress to training — this could lead to reactivity issues down the line. Dogs have something called an oppositional reflex. What that means is when pressure is applied to them, they have the natural instinct to push or pull back. It’s not because they’re disobedient; it’s how they’re hardwired. Because of their oppositional reflex, yanking a dog or holding a dog’s leash too tightly near you just makes the problem worse. You want to aim for a loose, slack leash.\nLevel up your equipment.\nIf a dog is really strong, as Lola will probably be when she’s grown up, you might need a piece of equipment that gives you more control without adding pain. We want to control using leverage, not suppress using force.\nNo-pull harnessesare a good start. That’s a harness where the leash attaches in front of the dog on the chest area, which is right in front of the dog’s center of gravity. When the dog goes to pull forward, they can’t as easily engage the pressure on the leash and pull you. You can also give them a bit of a pull back and interrupt their forward momentum without hurting their neck and restricting their airways.\nStyle and safety don’t have to be mutually exclusive (phew).\nIf the harness isn’t effective or your dog is improving but occasionally jolts out of line, a head collar is another potential solution. A head collar is a bit more intrusive to a dog than the harness, so it does take some time to desensitize your dog to be comfortable wearing it. It doesn’t operate on pain, but it fits around a dog’s snout, so some dogs have trouble getting used to it. The device operates on leverage; it’s similar to a horse bridle.\nKeep in mind that the training has to happen with or without equipment. The harness or head collar can help you get in front of a dog’s ability to use their body weight to pull you forward, but it won’t solve the problem. Plus, your training regimen with your dog is a bond the two of you form together, and it will be the greatest tool to problem solve in the future.",

  "page_content": "When you adopt a puppy, you have a lot of choices to make, fromchoosing the best dietto finding the perfecttraining classes. One of the biggest decisions you’ll have to make is when to spay or neuter your puppy.\nFor decades, it’s been common to spay or neuter dogs between the ages of four to six months, but recent research has suggested that may be too early for some puppies. While it’s hard to ignore the many health benefits of spaying and neutering, the question of when to schedule your puppy’s surgery is a little more complicated. Learn about when to spay a dog and when to neuter a dog based on their breed and size.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nNeuter vs. spay: What is the difference?\nFirst thing’s first: You need to understand the difference betweenneutering and spaying. While these terms both refer to sterilization, they’re not interchangeable.\nNeutering a dog, a surgery known as castration or an orchiectomy, involves removing the testicles and associated structures from a male dog, eliminating the animal’s ability to reproduce. Spaying refers to the same concept for female dogs, known as an ovariohysterectomy. The dog spaying procedure involves removing the uterus and ovaries to end a female dog’s heat cycle and the possibility of pregnancy.\nA vet’s take on why it’s a smart choice.Snip, snip!\nBoth spaying and neutering prevent litters of puppies, reducing the animal population and the need for pet euthanasia in shelters.\nAt what age should I spay or neuter my dog?\nSo, when is the best time to spay a dog? Many vets used to recommend spaying or neutering a puppy between four and six months of age, butmore recent studiessuggest that the right time for the surgery depends on the dog’s size and breed. If you’re determining when to spay a female dog, it’s best to discuss in detail with your vet, who can help you identify any potential medical concerns in the future that could be impacted by an early spay.\nLarger dogs often take longer to reach sexual maturity, so vets now suggest waiting to spay or neuter until these pups are a little older. While you should always discuss your dog’s specific needs with your vet, below are some general guidelines for when to neuter a dog or spay a dog based on size and sex:\nFor small dogs (22 pounds or less), females should be spayed before their first heat, which is around five to six months old and males at around six months.\nFor small dogs (22 pounds or less), females should be spayed before their first heat, which is around five to six months old and males at around six months.\nFor medium-sized dogs (between 25 and 45 pounds), the same guidelines apply — females before their first heat (at five to six months) and males by six months.\nFor medium-sized dogs (between 25 and 45 pounds), the same guidelines apply — females before their first heat (at five to six months) and males by six months.\nFor large dogs (over 45 pounds) or giant dogs (over 75 pounds), males should be neutered after their growth ends, usually around nine to 15 months. For females, the decision should be based on additional factors, such as disease risk and your lifestyle, but you may want to wait to spay your dog until they’re at least nine months old.\nFor large dogs (over 45 pounds) or giant dogs (over 75 pounds), males should be neutered after their growth ends, usually around nine to 15 months. For females, the decision should be based on additional factors, such as disease risk and your lifestyle, but you may want to wait to spay your dog until they’re at least nine months old.\nSpot lumps, limps, and lethargy early on.\nSigns your female dog needs to be spayed\nMost female dogs enter their first heat, known as estrous, when they’re around nine or 10 months old. If you don’t spay your dog prior to her first heat, you can expect to deal with some less-than-fun new behaviors that serve as signs your dog needs to be spayed, such as:\nUp to two weeks of bleeding (yes, dogs get periods, too), which means investing in and changing dog diapers\nUp to two weeks of bleeding (yes, dogs get periods, too), which means investing in and changing dog diapers\nAbrupt changes in mood\nAbrupt changes in mood\nUnwanted attention from male dogs in your area (which can mean stray dogs showing up at your door or in your yard)\nUnwanted attention from male dogs in your area (which can mean stray dogs showing up at your door or in your yard)\nIf you choose to spay your dog before her first heat, you can avoid all these behaviors, as well as never worry about your dog ending up pregnant with a litter of pups you’ll have to care and find homes for.\nWe know, our pets grow up too fast. But seriously, how fast is too fast (or slow)? Kinship and Waltham Petcare Science Institute created a simple tool to help your new pet’s growth stay on track.\nSigns your male dog needs to be neutered\nFor male dogs, their first heat leads to multiple new behaviors, which can range from the frustrating to the dangerous, such as:\nUrine marking, both outside and in the house\nUrine marking, both outside and in the house\nMounting and/or humping\nMounting and/or humping\nAnoverprotective attitude\nAnoverprotective attitude\nAggression\nAggression\nRoaming and running away, which can result in injury or even death\nRoaming and running away, which can result in injury or even death\nNeutering your dog before their first heat can curb their instinct to wander and keep your dog safe at home, as well as prevent them from harassing local female dogs.\nWhat about large-breed dogs?\nDifferent dogs mature at different ages, and large dogs tend to reach sexual maturity much later than small and medium dogs. While it’s likely perfectly safe (and healthy!) to spay or neuter toy and medium breeds at as early an age as six to nine months, spaying or neutering large breeds too soon can lead to a number of health issues later in life, including urinary incontinence, orthopedic issues, and some types of cancer.\nKeep in mind that delaying spay or neuter until your large dog is older does not guarantee your dog won’t suffer from any of these conditions. However, the benefits of waiting to neuter your dog include the reduced likelihood of some illnesses.\nNo less than 7 animal behaviorists weigh in on what’s behindall of this bumping and grinding.\nWhat are the benefits of neutering or spaying my dog early?\nThe earlier you spay or neuter your dog, the easier the surgery for both the vet and the patient. Younger dogs recover more quickly from these surgeries, which also tend to be less complicated if performed before your dog reaches sexual maturity.\nA quick recovery is not the only benefit of an early spay or neuter. If spayed early, your female dog will never go into heat, which means no dealing with a menstrual cycle and no risk of pregnancy. Spaying your dog also eliminates the risk of any illness associated with the reproductive organs, like uterine or ovarian cancer.\nThe benefits of neutering a dog include preventing the urge to roam, keeping your pup away from dangers like traffic, fights with other animals, injury, and theft. Neutered dogs will also not engage in thatobnoxious humping behaviorthat embarrasses pet parents in front of every houseguest.\nBest of all, spaying and neutering can increase your dog’s life expectancy, so you can keep your beloved friend around even longer.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nWhat are the disadvantages of neutering or spaying my dog early?\nSex hormones are part of any animal’s natural development, and spaying or neutering eliminates some of those hormones, which can affect all parts of yourpup’s development. If you spay or neuter too early, your dog’s psychological, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal development could be affected.\nAnd as mentioned above, spaying or neutering a large dog too early can lead to increased risks of multiple health conditions, such as:\nJoint issues, such as hip and elbow dysplasia\nJoint issues, such as hip and elbow dysplasia\nCranial cruciate rupture or tear\nCranial cruciate rupture or tear\nSome cancers, such as lymphoma\nSome cancers, such as lymphoma\nWhat are the benefits of waiting to spay or neuter your dog?\nIf you have a large-or giant-breed dog, waiting a little longer to spay or neuter can help reduce the risks of health issues, such as hip dysplasia, immune diseases, and some cancers, as well as prevent urinary incontinence and struggles with weight gain.\nWill spaying or neutering change my dog’s behavior?\nSpaying or neutering can prevent quite a few unwanted behaviors, like urinating indoors and mounting. Neutered males also no longer have the innate desire to roam, which can help keep your dog safe. Many believe that one of the side effects of neutering a dog isreduced aggression, but that hasn’t been definitively proven.\nAre there any risks associated with spaying or neutering?\nAs with any surgery, there are some risks involved. Adult dogs or dogs with other health conditions are more likely to experience complications from surgery, and some pet parents have reported that their dogs gained weight after spaying or neutering because of the changes in hormones. Weight gain is an especially common side effect of spaying a female dog.\nSurgery also involves the use of anesthesia, which is just as safe for dogs as it is for humans but in rare cases can have a negative effect. However, spaying and neutering are the most common — and often safest — surgeries that veterinarians perform, so your pet will most likely recover with no issues.\nSadly, yes — one in four dogs will develop mammary tumors — but there's an easy way to prevent them.\nAre there alternatives to consider?\nWhile spaying or neutering are the most common sterilization options for dogs, there are some other alternatives your vet may bring up:\nVasectomy: While not common, there are procedures for male dogs similar to those for humans that sever the tubes, which move sperm from the testes.\nVasectomy: While not common, there are procedures for male dogs similar to those for humans that sever the tubes, which move sperm from the testes.\nPartial spay: A hysterectomy for female dogs involves removing the uterus, but leaving the ovaries.

A routine neuter can range anywhere from $45 to over $300, while a routine spay can be $65 to over $600.\nFortunately, many areas have local free or low-cost spay/neuter clinics, so contact your local Humane Society or SPCA to find out about opportunities near you. You may also choose to adopt a dog from a shelter that includes spay or neuter services in their adoption fee.\nIt’s no laughing matter. Try these at-home treatments—and if they don’t work, take your dog to the vet ASAP.\nSpaying before your pet enters their first heat decreases your dog’s risk of some cancers and reduces the hassle of cleaning up after a menstruating dog, which can definitely get messy.\nFor larger dogs, spaying too early can lead to health conditions like hip dysplasia, torn ligaments, urinary incontinence, and some cancers.\nNeutering a dog too early can result in a loss of bone mass and even lead to behavioral issues, like aggression.\nReferences\nShould You Neuter Your Dog?\nShould You Neuter Your Dog?\nShould I Consider Hormone-Sparing Sterilization for My Dog?\nShould I Consider Hormone-Sparing Sterilization for My Dog?\nAmerican Veterinary Medical Association - Spaying and neutering\nAmerican Veterinary Medical Association - Spaying and neutering\nWhen Should You Neuter Your Dog to Avoid Health Risks?\nWhen Should You Neuter Your Dog to Avoid Health Risks?",

  "page_content": "So, how did those early puppy days go for you? Did your dog miss out on socialization during their critical early months? Maybe you were advised to keep your puppy isolated for health reasons, or your work schedule had you so swamped that nothing went according to plan, or youadopted an adult dogwho didn’t get off to the best start in life for who-knows-what-reason. No matter how your dog wound up with a socialization deficit, there’s a good chance you frantically Googled it and are now worried about your pup’s prospects for happiness.\nBut it’s actually not all gloom and doom. There are things you can do instead of throwing your hands up in despair. Here’s the intel on how to most effectively — and kindly — teach your dog that the world isn’t such a scary place.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nFirst, don’t panic.\nSeriously, all is not lost. Sure, this isn’t the ideal situation, but your dog can still have a wonderfully fulfilling life. Tons of dogs who weren’t socialized “by the book,” experience joy every day, and so do their people. The key to making that a reality for dogs who have not had the benefit of proper socialization is the same as for almost all goals: work slowly and patiently. Rather than pushing your dog, accept that they will determine how fast you get where you want to go. Setting an arbitrary deadline for their progress is not helpful. There’s never been a circumstance better suited for the phrase, “It’s the journey, not the destination.”\nTuning in to your senior’s needs.\nRemember the purpose of socialization.\nThe aim is to expose your dog to a variety of objects, social partners, sounds, sights, and experiences in a positive and non-threatening way. During the early months of their lives (especially from three to 12 weeks, which technically represents the socialization stage of development), puppies are really good at accepting anything they encounter in a non-scary way. It’s super-easy during this critical period for dogs to get used to new things if the new things are connected to happy experiences. (“That man with the funny hat gives metreats!” Or, “This floor has a weird feeling, but it’s fun toplay fetchon it!”)\nIt’s generally harder for dogs to adjust to novelty after the socialization window has closed, though the better the socialization was, the easier it is for them to generalize. (“Oh, another peculiar hat — that’s cool.” Or, “Wow, this floor is different than the others — that’s fine.”) For adult dogs who did not have those good experiences early on, learning to accept new things and be comfortable in the world takes more effort, but progress can be made and can continue to be made throughout their lives.\nIt’s kind of like learning a language. It’s much easier for babies and young children than it is for adults — almost effortless with the right exposure. But adults can and do learn foreign languages all the time. The degree to which they master the language depends on their natural abilities and the time and effort they put in.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a shy pup to go from wallflower to social butterfly.\nKeep experiences positive.\nThe most important part of making up for lost socialization opportunities is to keep it positive. Your dog can learn to accept novel situations and experiences or become less fearful of them by having many, many positive experiences.\nFor example, let’s say your dog didn’t meet children early in their life and now finds them terrifying. They can learn to be OK around children if you begin with a child who’s too far away to upset them. When they see a calm child down the block or on the other side of the park, give them a treat. Do that enough times, and your dog will start to associate the sight of a child with a reward. That makes seeing a child a positive experience, and that’s great.\nOver time, you can gradually — and the operative word here isgradually— have your dog in situations with a child who is closer, or with multiple children, in ways that don’t upset them but instead, continue to teach your dog to be happy about seeing children. Those positive experiences are critical for success.\nWhich comes first: a nervous person or a nervous pup?\nConversely, you cannot help your dog become comfortable around children by exposing them to negative experiences — say, with a child a few feet away or a nearby gaggle of children running, screaming, and throwing their backpacks around. That’s too much for most dogs, well-socialized or not, and no number of treats can make it into a positive experience. Those negative experiences work against the goal of helping your dog be comfortable around kids by reinforcing the idea they already have about children being terrifying.\nGo slowly and don’t rush your dog.\nHelping your dog succeed takes many steps, and there is nothing to be gained by rushing through them. In fact, rushing your pup is counterproductive. Let them guide your timeline rather than the other way around. If they’re handling a situation well, great. If not, get your dog out of it. Accept that they are providing you with an opportunity to practice your own patience.\nIf you force them to be too close to something or spend too much time in a context in which they’re uncomfortable, you will only get in the way of their progress; you will not accelerate it. Any time you’re trying to help your dog overcome a fear or discomfort, you must be willing to retreat, even if you don’t want to.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nIdeally, you can keep the situation positive and quit while you’re ahead, but if that fails, you must remove them. Protecting your dog from situations that cause your pup distress is a great kindness. Work with your dog where they are, exposing them to new things in ways that work for your pup without trying to expose them to the whole world at once.\nAdjust your expectations.\nIf your adult dog missed out on puppy socialization, they’re taking a different route than they would have with the benefit of those early experiences. Don’t expect them to be a social butterfly who handles absolutely everything with the greatest of ease. Frankly, dogs with perfect socialization histories don’t often end up that way, and it’s even less likely for a dog who didn’t have such opportunities. Remember, the goal is a dog who is safe and happy, comfortable with most of the things and people they encounter in life. Your pup doesn’t have to be a happy-go-lucky dog without a care in the world to be incredibly fortunate and enjoy life to its fullest.\nDon’t try to do this on your own.\nThere are many resources to help a dog who needs to learn to be comfortable and unafraid, includingbooks, webinars, andwebsites. Make use of them. Many focus on helpingfearful dogs. That’s because most dogs who were not well-socialized are fearful of various aspects of the world, whether it’s cats, other dogs, people, carpeting, stairs, or the sound of cars.\nDo these things to help your pup (and your guests) feel chill.\nSeek out individualized help. A qualified trainer or behaviorist can teach you how to use the principles of classical conditioning along with the best treats and toys to help your dog make positive associations between new things and feeling good. It may not be as quick as if they had had those exposures as a puppy, but they can still make them.\nTake advantage of what they can already handle.\nFor example, many dogs have not been well-socialized with people but are verycomfortable with other dogs. Take advantage of that and go new places with a dog buddy. If one isn’t already living in your house, perhaps you can borrow a dog, or a friend and their dog can come along on outings.\nOr maybe they had what some would describe as “no socialization,” but that’s not actually accurate. Did they meet a couple of people? Hear high winds blowing or walk on grass as well as pavement? All of these exposures are helpful and make them very different from a dog who truly had no socialization at all. There are rare and heartbreaking examples of dogs who’ve had no human or canine interaction during the first six months of their lives. While these dogs are much more challenging to rehabilitate and are unlikely to make as much progress as most dogs, the principles are the same.\nRemember that many dogs thrive even without ideal socialization experiences, and there’s always time to help your dog achieve many of the benefits of socialization. It’s essential to adjust your expectations based on the start they had in life, but that doesn’t mean you should give up on them. The effort requires patience, time, and a realistic setting of expectations. Go slowly, keep experiences positive, be diligent about helping your dog handle things that alarm them, and protect them from situations that could overwhelm them. Plenty of dogs who were not socialized in a textbook manner are filled with love and joy every day, and your dog can be one of them.",

  "page_content": "Since you were a little kid, you’ve been told about “stranger danger.” Don’t go up to anyone you don’t know, stay with your assigned buddy on your field trip, and maintain a healthy level of suspicion at all times. Guess what? Some dogs — not all of them! — also has one metaphorical eyebrow arched when it comes to new people.\nDogs who are super sweet and friendly with people they know but act completely differently with people they don’t know are probably in that “stranger danger” zone. It’s common for dogs to divide people into those who are familiar and those who are unfamiliar. Many dogs are perfectly happy to be around unfamiliar people and make friends quickly.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWouldyouwant a stranger coming right up to your face?\nBut there are lots of dogs who are not easily able to make friends, and the unfamiliar people they see or come into contact with cause a lot of stress. These dogs do not easily make new friends, and anyone unfamiliar tends to stay in that category without a lot of work to help them cross the boundary into the familiar group. Dogs like these are said to have “stranger danger.” Stranger danger is quite common in dogs, in part because there are multiple reasons for it.\nWhat are the causes of stranger danger?\nThere are three main reasons why dogs struggle to be comfortable around people they don’t know — genetics, inadequatesocialization, and trauma. For any dog with stranger danger, at least one of these is probably an issue, but many dogs can have more than one or even all three of these in their history.\nGenetics plays a huge role in how accepting dogs are of anything or anyone unfamiliar. Some dogs are just naturally wired to be wary of anything new, and some dogs have the opposite natural tendency, meaning they easily accept the unfamiliar. Genetics alone does not determine how fearful dogs are or how easily they are able to adjust to new people, but genes are important. A dog’s genetics influence the likelihood of being fearful of strangers, but there is a lot of variation because of the way their life experiences affect how they turn out. A tendency toward fearfulness, and therefore to stranger danger, is heritable, meaning that it tends to be passed down from parents to their puppies. Puppies who come from shy and fearful parents are more likely to be shy and fearful themselves, and there are entire lineages of dogs that are characterized by fearfulness towards people and trouble accepting new people.\nThis study says it’s actually less about what’sintheir DNA and more about what’sonit.\nInadequate socialization is a major cause of stranger danger, which is why dog trainers and canine behaviorists are always encouraging people to socialize their dogs. Socialization is actually a technical term, but it is often used casually to mean being social, which is confusing. I’m using it here in its full scientific glory to mean something very specific: to expose a puppy to a variety of new experiences during a critical period of their lives.\nThe critical period for puppy socialization starts at aboutthree weeks of ageand lasts until they are about 14 weeks of age. During this specific time of life, which can also be called a sensitive period, puppies are extra receptive to learning that new things are not scary. Meeting just a few people and having positive experiences with them at this young age allows them to learn effortlessly that people are good and not to be feared. If they do not learn this lesson during this time, they may be able to learn it later on, but it takes far more effort, far more work, and may not ever be learned as completely as if they had these good exposures at the right age.\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nLearning these social lessons about people (and about cats, or other dogs, or even ferrets and other animals in the home) can be compared to learning a language. Yes, you can learn a language at any age, but if you learn it as a child, you will be a native speaker or at least a highly skilled speaker — but you are extremely unlikely to develop that degree of proficiency with languages that you learn when you are older. That’s because people have a critical or sensitive period for language acquisition, just as puppies have a window of time for the acquisition of social skills, including being comfortable with strangers. A great book for this isPuppy Socialization: What It Is and How to Do Itby Marge Rogers and Eileen Anderson.\nTraumatic Experiences\nTrauma can cause a dog to be afraid of strangers. If a dog somehow associates people with a terrible situation, such as being in serious pain or really frightened, they may develop stranger danger. Terrible experiences can range from a long history of abuse by people or a single experience that is upsetting. Those experiences can be as simple as seeing a new person right as a door slams. The loud sound can scare the dog, who associates the fear with the person who just happens to be standing there — wrong place, wrong time.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nI have known dogs whose stranger danger developed after a painful medical procedure or an injury. One dog I knew got stuck in a fence and injured as result. Even though a kind passerby helped save the dog, he still became terrified of new people, probably because the worst moment of his life involved a new person. That new person was the good guy, but the dog didn’t view it that way.\nTragically, there are people who abuse dogs, and dogs in those abusive situations often continue to fear people even once they are living with kind people and only meeting good people. The fear of what people can do doesn’t go away just because the abuser is gone. The trauma remains. Sometimes, people assume that a dog with stranger danger was abused, and though that is sometimes the case (and no “angry” emojis are expressive enough for how this should make any good dog parent feel!), it is far more common that the dog was poorly socialized or is just naturally fearful because of their genetics.No amountof abuse is acceptable, but it sometimes helps me cope to remember that it’s rare.\nThere’s nothing to fear but fear itself — and a dog who won’t stop shaking when it thunders.\nWhat are the signs that your dog has stranger danger?\nDogs who are fearful of people frequently express their fear through their behavior, including their body language. Recognizing fearfulness in dogs requires knowledge and experience. Here are some of the common signs.\nDogs who are afraid tend to make their body look smaller. They may do this by crouching close to the ground, lowering their head, putting their ears back, lowering or even tucking their tail, and rounding their back.\nWhen frightened, dogs may close their mouths, pull the corners of their mouths back, flick their tongues, furrow their brows, yawn, or dilate their pupils. Some fearful dogs tremble, pant, drool, or sweat through their feet and leave paw prints as they walk. Pacing and being unable to settle are clues your dog may be fearful. There are fearful dogs who whimper and whine, but others may growl and bark. Some may run away and hide when they see a stranger.\nPro tips for boosting the confidence of a scaredy-cat dog.\nTypes of People Typical Fearful Dogs Are Afraid Of\nFearful dogs are afraid of unfamiliar people but are far better with people they know. Most fearful dogs are more afraid of men than of women, especially if those men are tall, have a deep voice, or are sporting a beard. People carrying things such as a backpack, grocery bags, a chair, garden tools or a broom, or even a clipboard are more likely to upset fearful dogs, as are people who are wearing sunglasses, hats, or full masks like those used for Halloween. (Curiously, surgical masks rarely upset dogs, which was an interesting fact many behaviorists and trainers learned early on in the pandemic.)\nPatterns of Aggression Caused By Fear\nIf a fearful dog is also aggressive, they may follow a typical pattern. Fearful, aggressive dogs may act out more toward strangers when they are with close family members, and if they do bite, it’s especially common for them to do so when somebody reaches for them ortries to pet them, surprises them by seemingly appearing out of nowhere, or when the person turns around and has their back facing the dog.\nHow can you help a dog with stranger danger?\nHelping dogs with stranger danger involves patience, a gentle approach, lots of compassion, and perhaps seeking the help of a professional Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist. These people have the education, knowledge, and experience necessary to help fearful dogs. There are two basic ways to help dogs overcome their fear of strangers.\nDo these things to help your pup (and your guests) feel chill.\nProtect your dog from situations with strangers they can’t handle.\nIf your dog is scared of a person, don’t force the issue. Never push them to approach a person they fear or encourage the person to approach your dog. Trying to teach them not to fear people by showing them that “nothing bad happens” is ineffective because to them, something baddidhappen. The bad thing is that they felt fear. So, every time you push them to interact with or approach strangers, they have a bad experience, and that only makes the stranger danger worse. So instead of pushing the dog, avoid situations that are overwhelming, and protect your dog from people who scare them. Even if you see no reason why your dog should be afraid of someone, respect their feelings and keep your dog out of situations with strangers who scare them.\nExpand the range of situations with strangers that your dog can handle.\nOvercoming the fear of strangers requires changing the emotional response of your dog to seeing unfamiliar people, and that can be accomplished with classical counterconditioning, or CC. CC is pairing up what the dog fears with something they love, such as chicken or steak, but the feared things (strangers) must be presented at very low intensity. In fact, the intensity must be too low to trigger the fear. A person who is very far away or who is sitting down may be below the threshold, for example.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nCertainly, one person at a time is easier to handle than multiple people. The goal is to pair up a stranger with treats enough times for the dog to learn that strangers predict something delicious. With enough repetition, the dog learns to feel happy about seeing strangers because they come to expect a treat. Then, the intensity can gradually be increased until the dog is happy to see strangers at closer and closer distances, or when two strangers appear instead of just one. The goal is for the dog to have a positive emotional reaction to seeing a person, because they know that something good is about to happen.If your dogs has stranger danger, it’s important to know that it is common, and that it is an issue that can be improved. Many people have successfully helped their dogs overcome this fear, and you can, too.",

  "page_content": "As a canine behaviorist, many human behaviors scare me. My heart leaps into my throat when I see people performing risky behaviors, like hugging and picking up dogs, sticking their faces right by a dog’s face, or bending over a dog. When I see people doing things like this, I want to shout out a warning. I feel the same way when I’m watching a horror movie and want to yell, “Don’t go inside the dilapidated, vine-covered house!”\nI work with many clients whose dogs have bitten someone, and as I hear the stories of what happened, the same human behaviors are mentioned over and over. I’m not saying this to blame the people, but rather to help us all learn how to lower our risk of being bitten. Dog bites are a serious problem that should be avoided at all costs. Among the most distressing are bites to the face. In a December 2015study, scientists examined 132 incidents of bites to human faces that did not involve bites to any other parts of the body. The goal of the study was to determine the human behavior that preceded the bites.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nWell-known risky behaviors, such as bending over a dog, putting your face close to a dog’s face, and making very close eye contact with the dog occurred before many of the bites (which is no surprise). What was a bit of a shock was the percentage of times that these no-no behaviors happened before the 132 incidents in the study.\nIn 76 percent of the bites, people bent over the dog just before the bite. In 19 percent of cases, a bite was preceded by people putting their faces close to the dog’s face, and in five percent of cases, gazing between dog and person at close range occurred before a bite. In no incidents was a bite to the face preceded bytrimming the dog’s nails, falling on the dog, hitting the dog as punishment, stepping on the dog, pulling the dog’s hair, tugging the dog’s body, or scolding the dog.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nMore than 75 percent of the bites to the face happened to people who knew the dog. Over two-thirds of the bites were to children, and of those, 84 percent were to children under the age of 12. Children who were bitten were with their parents in 43 percent of the cases and with the dog guardian in 62 percent of the incidents. Sixty percent of the bites were to females, and no adults were bitten by their own dogs. More than half of the bites were to the nose and lips of the person, as opposed to the chin, cheek, forehead or eye area.\nAll of the dogs who bit someone in the face were adult dogs, and over two-thirds of them were male. In only six percent of the bites did people report that the dog gave a warning such asgrowlingor performing a tooth display (aka, showing their teeth) prior to biting. To me, this is the single most surprising finding in the study, and I think it’s quite possible that some people did not notice or failed to remember warnings from the dogs.\nA PSA to pay better attention to our best friends’ body language.\nAs the authors of the paper mention, their research is based on questionnaires that asked people about past events. As a result, there are inherent limitations to the study. Still, the findings about the frequency with which kids are bitten, the greater likelihood of male dogs biting faces than female dogs, and the finding that only adult dogs bite faces are consistent with previous research — and they show that our human actions often have a role in a snappy pup’s behavior.",

Often, the use oftreatsor favorite toys is involved so that the dog learns that all visitors have something fun and wonderful to offer. When a dog has grasped the strong connection between visitors and good things, happiness can replace fear as the dog’s response to people coming to the house.

Keep reading to learn what it is and how to try it.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nExpert advice for people with dogs who jump, bark, and generally go nuts when people come over.\nHow to Help a Fearful Dog Handle Visitors\nThe trick is to make sure your dog doesn’t see the visitors when they enter. Instead, you want your dog to encounter the guest when they are already settled in the house. It’s a lot easier for a dog to see people already seated in the living room or around the table than it is for them to see people arrive and enter. Having visitors show up at the door is a very intense situation for a fearful dog. The sight, smell, and sound of someone other than a family member appearing at the door and entering the home is a big deal to a dog who is not comfortable with new people. It sets off all of their alarm bells (“Intruder!”).\nTo avoid that, tell your visitors to call or text right before coming in so you can make sure you have the situation set up to maximize your chances of success. Before opening the door for your visitors, temporarily put your dog in a place out of sight of the entry, such as in acratein another room, in the backyard, or in the laundry room. I’ve even had clients briefly put their dog in the car in the garage if that is where the dog is most comfortable when not with their humans.\nYoucanlive in a quiet house again.\nOnce your dog is where you want them, let your visitors in, have them sit down, and give them whatever treats or toys your dog loves best. Then, bring your dog into the room and have them give your dog the goodies. Depending on the details of the dog’s issues, you may need to have your dog on aleashor behind a gate during this interaction.\nSome dogs will be fine with people once they have met them in this way, and if that’s the case, then this may be all you have to do during this particular visit. Other dogs may react poorly if anyone stands up or makes any sudden movements, so it may be better to keep them separate from your visitors after the initial exposure. Such dogs can benefit from additional work, but this technique can still be a good first step.\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nNo single method suits every dog, and extra caution is always advisable with dogs who have bitten someone. Still, it is easier for almost all fearful dogs to meet visitors who are already in the house sitting down than it is to meet people as they enter the house. It will take time and patience for your dog to learn this skill. Like everything with dog training, there is no quick fix. But, with the help of a friend or two, a handful of treats, and a little patience, you can help ease your dog’s fear of household visitors.",

Also note your dog’s body language at the time — ears perked up orheld back,tail stiffor tucked between their legs? Once you connect the dots, you can better train them to go on mute. Below, how to stop your dog from barking in every scenario.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nThe top five reasons dogs bark—and how to get them to relax a bit.\nAlert Barking\nIf your pup starts yapping when the mail carrier shows up or someone walks past your house, that’s probably alert-barking, which is pretty common. You can unintentionally reinforce this behavior just by going about your business. As far as your dog is concerned, their barking may have been the scare tactic that successfully kept your home safe from an intruder.\nGet a head start on breaking the habit by blocking visibility when you’re not actively in training mode. Then, set up training sessions where you mark and treat your dog when they sit quietly while people pass by. You may have to start with an obscene number oftreats, doling them out as each person passes, but once your dog catches on, you’ll be able to reel it back in.\nIf your dog’s tail is wagging“to the left, to the left,”asBeyoncésays, it could mean they’re anxious.\nReactivity\nDoes your dog lunge and bark like a hellhound when other dogs or people walk past? That’s called reactivity, and it’s brought on byfear, over-excitement, or frustration. You can help in this department by keeping your pup “under threshold,” meaning giving them plenty of distance from triggers so they can keep their cool. Then, pull a mark-and-treat routine on them to redirect their focus from the trigger back to you. They can still look around, but get them comfortable enough to check in with you regularly. Remember that not all triggers are created equal — a dog walking toward you may grind your pet’s gears more than one walking away, so be observant and change your approach accordingly.\nSeparation Anxiety\nWhen a dog starts barking up a storm the second you leave — and keeps it up until you return — you’ve gotseparation anxietyon your hands. This is a panic disorder and, to them, your departure is on par with getting lost at the grocery store as a kid. Milder cases of separation anxiety may just involve some barking and pacing, but in more extreme ones, dogs can damage property or even injure themselves while trying to escape your home to find you. Again, keeping your dog “under threshold” can help. In this case, that means not leaving them alone for longer than they’re comfortable — at first.\nDoes your dog freak out when you head for the door? Here’s some advice.\nStart practicing short departures: walking to the front door, opening and closing it, then going back to your dog and treating them. The next step is walking out the door, closing it behind you, then returning and treating. Keep an eye on their body language and shorten the time you’re away if you pick up on distress signals. Baby steps. When you’re not around, a stuffedKongcan keep your pup distracted,CBDcan calm them down, and a video monitor can monitor their stress levels. If your dog’s separation anxiety stays at fever pitch, consider consulting with your vet about anti-anxiety medication (but only after you’ve exhausted all training options).\nDemand Barking\nWhen your dog barks at you when you’re not paying attention to them or when they’re ready for their dinner, they’re making demands. As tempting as it may be to give in to make it stop, doing so will only reinforce (and exacerbate) this behavior. Try curbing this habit by increasing your dog’s daily enrichment, engaging both their brain and body withpuzzle toys, training sessions, and long walks so they’ll burn energy and won’t bug you.\nLet the games begin.\nIf you pay attention to changes in their body language, you can spot (and stop) barking before it starts. If you miss a cue, don’t scold your dog — that’s still acknowledging the behavior. Instead, your best weapon is a cold shoulder. You can say a lot by saying nothing at all, and your pup is sure to get the message.",

  "page_content": "Does your dog reliably come in response to a signal like the whirl of a can opener, the sound of a treat drawer or jar being opened, or the word “walk”? When your dog hears cues that promise something they like, they come running — every time and with great enthusiasm. Yet, one of the most common behavioral frustrations that pet parents have is that their dogs won’tcome when called.\nThere is a lot to be revealed about dog behavior by situations in which you may have accidentally trained your dogs to have a good recall (meaning they come back to you). If you feel like you’re failing in your efforts — there’s a silver lining here: you can use lessons from these accidental recalls to get your dog to come when you want them to.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nDoes Your Dog Run Away From You?\nPart of the issue is that all too many people expect their dogs to come when called without having trained them to do so. In fact, when people say, “My dog runs away and won't come when called,” the first question I ask is, “Have you trained them to do that?”\nKinshipCollective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a stubborn pup to listen up.\nThe fact is, dogs don’t come into this world ready to respond to the word “come” by trotting to you, much less to do it joyfully or to do it every time. It takes a lot of repetition for dogs to learn what thecuemeans and to respond to it as we would like them to. It’s unreasonable to assume that your dog will run to you when you call them — simply because they are a dog, and you are a person, and that’s what you want them to do.\nDogs tend to do things that make them happy. That approach to life — seeking joy — is something we love about them, and it makes sense to take advantage of it in training. Teaching a dog to come to you rather than run away involves developing a strong association between your signal and something good happening for the dog. If your dog learns that coming to you in response to a specific cue leads to good things for them, then they’ll want to come, and will do so consistently.\nFor example, once your dog figures out that every time you pick up the leash, they go for a walk, they will naturally approach you when you pick up the leash. Similarly, if they learn that the crinkling of a treat bag is a sure sign that treats are in their future, it should come as no surprise that this sound prompts them to run to you as fast as their legs can carry them. The key is that you’re doing something that your dog can rely on to result in a positive experience.\nTikTok pet parents have made this clear: Tone matters. Celebrity dog trainer Nicole Ellis says dogs can hear “stress in our voice — whether directed at them or when they hear us talking to others.”\nThis is a lesson that can be carried over from accidental to purposeful (re)training: make sure that something good happens every single time your dog responds appropriately to the cue.\nNegative Associations That Push Your Dog Away\nSometimes, what you “reward” your dog with when they come falls intonegativeterritory. When you don’t have a treat because you forgot or didn’t feel like going to get one, you skip that step and give the dog a less-than-thrilling “Good girl, good girl, good girl,” along with apat on the head, something most dogs generally dislike.\nOr, they may use a treat that the dog isn’t very excited about — regular dog kibble or a dry biscuit instead of something meaty and smelly and really tasty. (By way of analogy, most of us respond differently to spinach, dry crackers, and brownies. I do like spinach and crackers, but of the three, only a brownie is wonderful enough to elevate my mood.)\nBaby talk works on puppies. As for adult dogs, that’s still up for debate.\nIt’s not unusual for a dog to respond beautifully to being called, only to find that they have left the fun of the yard for the boredom of the house, where they’ll perhaps be alone for hours. People also call their dogs to come for things many dogs consider horrible, such as a bath or a nail trim.\nIn these cases, “Come!” serves as a warning. (“Thanks for the heads up — I’ll stay away so I don’t have to stop playing and I can avoid whatever misery you have in mind.”) The result is that the dog is not nearly as willing or interested in coming as she would be if her people had trained the response to this cue properly, as so many have done accidentally.\n(Re)training Your Dog to Respond\nIn addition to starting over by training an intentional recall just as you trained the accidental one, you can also transfer the cue. “Transferring a cue” is a technical expression in dog training that means teaching your dog to respond to a new cue by pairing it with one they already know. So, if they always come to you when they hear the sound of a treat bag being opened, you simply say “Come” every time you’re about to open the treat bag, then reinforce them with atreatwhen they comply.\nSoon, with enough repetitions, your dog will learn that the cue predicts the sound of the treat bag, which predicts treats. Before long, “come” will predict treats in their mind just as the sound of the treat bag does. Then, you can call them to come and reinforce them for doing so without the opening-the-treat-bag sound. The cue has been transferred.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s pro tips for walking a pup that wantsto chase everything that moves.\nMany recalls are trained without thought, yet they are very effective because the training process followed the rules for teaching a perfect recall. Just because a perfect recall does not happen to be in response to saying, “Come!” doesn’t mean that a dog has not learned this most prized and valuable behavior. Accidental recalls are still recalls. Use them to your advantage.\nHere are the key points to keep in mind when training your dog to reliably return to you on cue.\nMake recall training a priority.\nMake recall training a priority.\nFigure out what makes your dog want to come to you.\nFigure out what makes your dog want to come to you.\nConsistently pair up the recall cue with your dog’s favorite things, aiming for 100 percent association between the word “come” (or whatever word you use) and something good.\nConsistently pair up the recall cue with your dog’s favorite things, aiming for 100 percent association between the word “come” (or whatever word you use) and something good.\nReinforce with a top-quality item.

  },
  "page_content": "Some dogs eat so fast that a reasonable person would bet good money that they either think their speediness will make a steak appear, or they think they only have 60 seconds before their kibble self-destructs. Many dogs do this throughout their lives without a  problem — but they are flirting with disaster.\nEating so quickly doesn’t allow dogs to chew or even really taste their food. More worrisome is that a dog speed eating can cause choking, gagging, vomiting, and an even more serious condition called Gastric Dilation (colloquially known asbloat). Canine bloat can result from a dog eating too much or too fast. The stomach expands because gasses build up to the point that the stomach can twist within the dog’s abdomen, preventing the gasses from escaping. The result: Circulation can be cut off to the stomach as well as to other organs including the heart. Dogs can die within hours of the onset of bloat, so it is a serious condition that requires immediate emergency medical attention if you suspect it. The bottom line? Eating fast is more than unsightly — it’s potentially dangerous.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nHow to Slow Down a Dog Who Eats Too Fast\nI am regularly asked how to train a dog to eat more slowly, and my answer is that it’s easier to make it physically impossible for them to eat that fast than it is to train them to eat slowly. There are a lot of ways to do this, but they all use the same principle: Set up a system that doesn’t allow them to eat more than a little bit of food at a time.\nThere are a lot of commercial options out there for slow feed dog bowls, but let’s start with a DIY slow-eating dog bowl solution. Place one small bowl upside down inside a big bowl and then pour the food over the small bowl and into the bigger one. That creates a narrow “moat” of food so your dog can’t gulp the entire meal down. They have to work their way around the entire circle of food.\nAnother option is to place toys that are too big to swallow (and that are clean!) in a food bowl so the dog has to move them out of the way or work around them to reach the food. It’s also common for people whose dogs tend to eat a bowl of food in a matter of seconds to scatter the food over a broad area so the dog has to move around for each piece of food. This works very well in houses with a single dog. If more than one dog is around, this option is a poor choice because it promotes competition, stress, and can lead toaggression over the food.\nMy favorite way to keep dogs from scarfing down their food too quickly is to use adog food puzzleor slow feeder dog bowl that is specific to this purpose. Food puzzles are often loud, but many dogs will work for a long time to roll or push a Kong Wobbler around to get the food to fall out. Some people even use snuffle mats for fast eaters. Not only does this slow down their eating, but it also provides mental exercise and gives dogs valuable experience being persistent and handling a bit of frustration. Never a bad thing, right?\nDog bowls labeled \"Slow Feed\" help dogs change the pace of their eating. Discouraging dogs from gulping food down quickly has many benefits, including better digestion, helping to prevent vomiting, and gastric bloat. Check out our list ofthe best dog food puzzles; if a slow feeder dog bowl is more your speed, there are many options out there:\nThis bowl can slow down your pup’s eating by 10X. It’s made in three different sizes and can safely hold wet or dry food, so you can easily cater to your dog’s individual dietary needs. The ridges will keep your pup engaged with their meal while regulating their pace.\nDogs are nothing if not huge fans of licking. This nifty pad will occupy and stimulate them mentally with their favorite activity.\nJust as 3D movies deter your appetite by making you nauseous, the 3D bone within this bowl will encourage your dog to eat slower by merely separating the food. While this bowl might not slow the most rambunctious dogs, it should work well for most dogs.\nOne dog bowl is cool. But you know what’scooler? Six dog bowls. And that’s where you’re headed with this silicone mat.\nThe slow feeder that’s as chic as it is practical. This homemade piece will have dogs not only pausing inbetween bites to breathe but also to take in the decor.\nTrot has reimagined puzzle feeders with magnetically secured stainless steel bowls on an elevated anti-spill silicone mat, making clean-up jobs easy and harder to come by.

  "page_content": "A Corgi who barks, spins, leaps, and sometimesbiteswhen anyone in her house stands up or moves around. A German Shepherd/Husky cross whobarks, lunges, and charges at dogs walking by her house. A Poodle whogrowlsat other dogs when on leash. A mixed breed who is terrified of visitors and barks at them nonstop. A Papillon puppy who bites his elderly Labrador Retriever housemate when the older dog doesn’t want to play with him. What do these aggressive dogs have in common? All of them had their behavior improved through the use of play.\nHow Play-Training Helps with Aggression in Dogs\nYears ago, I began to regularly incorporate play into programs for aggressive dogs. Play is a powerful tool when working with aggressive dogs who are misbehaving because of frustration,arousal, lack of impulse control, boredom, orfear. Play has a positive effect on emotions, which is why play-motivated fearful dogs often respond better to play than totreats, even if they are also highly treat-motivated — fear decreases faster and more thoroughly in response to the former than to the latter. There are many different ways that play can help aggressive dogs to behave better.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nHow It Works:\nTheoretically, you can stop a dog’s unwanted behavior by teaching them something incompatible with that behavior — for example, you can counteract a dog’s habit ofjumping on peopleby teaching them to sit in the presence of others. But when a dog struggles with high arousal (many aggressive dogs do), you’re more likely to have success by teaching the dog to perform anactivebehavior. Trying to teach a dog to lie down, stay, or another static, controlled behavior is more challenging and generally less effective.\nIf your dog loses their sh*t over anything—from a squirrel to a guest. Here are some tips to curtail that.\nOnce, I worked with a Corgi who was aggressive when people moved around, and the more aroused she was, the more reactive and out of control she became. My goal was to transfer that energy using her favorite game,fetch. Now, when people are active, she brings a ball to her people, who then play fetch with her. By itself, the act of getting a toy can have an inhibitory effect, but it’s even better to teach the dog to get a toy in order to initiate a game. The anticipation gave the Corgi a happy feeling: “Yay, somebody moved! That means playtime.”\nThe mixed breed, who was terrified of visitors, loved fetch and she warmed up fast to anyone who would play it with her. To take advantage of this, I used classical counterconditioning to change her emotional response to visitors. Specifically, I taught her to associate them with fetch; I wanted her to feel the same joy whenguests arrivedas she felt when playing fetch. So, everyone who entered her home threw a ball for her. Eventually, the appearance of a visitor became the cue that a game of fetch was about to happen. Instead of responding with fear because a stranger had entered, she now responds with enthusiasm.\nFor some dogs, it’s not as simple as just throwing a ball.\nThe German Shepherd/Husky cross, who reacted to dogs passing by, was easily aroused and struggled withimpulse control. Her pet parents, who had already tried calling her away and using treats to capture her attention, were convinced that she would never be able to focus on anything with another dog in sight. She was not just beyond their control but actually beyond her own control. However, she loved to play tug, and no matter how high her arousal was or what distractions were present, she was captivated by her tug rope.\nThis game was the perfect way to redirect her attention. Once she learned that when a dog came into view, she would be given an opportunity to play tug, she stopped going wild at the sight of a dog and instead, turned immediately and joyfully to her person for a play session. Tug helped her control herself.Tug has many advantages when working with an aggressive dog, as long as tug does not incite the aggression. It not only keeps the dog near you and their mouth occupied, it also allows you to direct the dog’s line of sight, which can be especially useful if the dog is visually stimulated. Dogs who tug usually love to play the game, which makes it a compelling option.\nChase? Wrestle? Tug-o-war? Find out which are fair game.\nThe Poodle who wasreactiveto other dogs when on leash is one of the most playful dogs I have ever known — and one of the smartest. His training was excellent, and he could perform many behaviors on cue, even in the presence of another dog. But if he saw the dog first, he would bark,lunge, and pullso hard on the leash that he had caused his person to fall more than once.All of that changed when I started reinforcing him with play. If he controlled himself when he saw another dog — performing any behavior other than reacting — he was allowed to play. He was willing to work for play, but the play had to be the “right” kind:running after his person. Once this reinforcement system was established, when he saw another dog, he would look at her as if to say, “Well, don’t you have some running to do?” and then happily chase after her.\nA few minutes — or even a few steps — are all you need to add joy to your dog’s day.\nFrustration and boredom were the root causes in the case of the Papillon puppy who was aggressive to the Labrador Retriever. The older dog was interested in playing with the puppy for no more than two to three minutes at a time, but the puppy wanted to frolic morning, noon, and night. When the Lab called a halt, thepuppy would growl, leap on the Lab and bite him, sometimes causing injuries.It was essential to find other ways to engage the Papillon in play — ways that would provide him with enough fun, mental and physical exercise, and other stimulation to keep him happy. The first step was to determine which toys, games, and activities appealed to him. Never has my job been easier, because this dog loved everything. I imagined him thinking, Plush toys? I love them. They’re my favorite. Tug toys? I love them. They’re my favorite. Balls? I love them. They’re my favorite.\nCue theSchoolhouse Rock!because learning can be fun.\nEvery single thing I tried was a success — puzzle-toys, squeaky toys, bouncy toys, rope toys, balls, disks, Kongs. He liked them all. Discovering a variety of new games and either learning or inventing ways to play with different toys satisfied his intense need for play. He played fetch, tug, chase, and hide-and-seek with people. When people weren’t available, he learned to enjoy throwing objects in the air and catching them,puzzlesof all sorts, dribbling a ball around like a soccer star, and rolling balls down ramps and then chasing after them. Between the variety of toys and the multiple “play stations” we set up around his house, he learned to entertain himself for long stretches at a time.\nOnce I showed his pet parents new ways to play with their puppy, they interacted with him much more, which took a lot of pressure off the older dog. Now, the Papillon plays appropriately and briefly with the Lab a few times a day, and when the Lab is done, the puppy chooses a different way to play. Providing additional options was essential in helping this puppy behave in an acceptable manner around the other dog in his family.There are many ways to change aggressive behavior, and an important part of my work is deciding which one will work best for a particular dog. While play is not part of the solution for every dog, it can help many of them, and increasingly, I find that I can help people and their dogs succeed by incorporating play into their programs. Yes, play is fun, but when working with aggressive dogs, it can be so much more.",

  },
  "page_content": "As someone prone to verbal blunders, I’m intimately familiar with the concept of an awkward introduction. But rather than just general weirdness after nervously saying the exact wrong thing, ill-advised greetings can have serious lingering effects on dogs. This is especially true for one of the most common meeting setups — face-to-face on leash.\n“I strongly suggest people don’t have on-leash greetings,” warns Charlie DiBono, trainer and founder ofBody and Mind K9in Long Beach, California. He explains that leashes are one of the best tools for communicating with our dogs, and when we introduce them to other pets while on one, it can jeopardize that connection. Not to mention, devaluing any obedience training they’ve had. This is because when our pup sees another dog, and we allow them to meet, we tend to tighten the leash. But that translates to the dog that we are nervous and, therefore, they should be, too. This communication can result in increased anxiety or a fight, which is the likely outcome.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nThere’s a lot more to it than sniffing each other’s butts.\nThe Problem With On-Leash Greetings\n“When meeting on-leash, dogs are coming at each other head-on. In the dog world, this means ‘I am a threat.’ It is natural for the dogs to feel defensive and react accordingly,” DiBono says. Even if an interaction is entirely positive on the surface and both dogs are cordial and calm, it can still cause problems almost immediately. After a lovely meet-and-greet, your pup will now want to say hello to every other dog they see. And if you don’t oblige, they may get frustrated and resort to leash reactivity or pulling.\nThe impetus of these risks for dogs on leashes is the same reason I stay off Tinder — it’s an unnatural way of meeting. “Dogs naturally greet each other bysniffingeach other’s rear ends and circling around each other. They typically approach in an arc rather than a straight line in an effort to show they are not a threat. This behavior is difficult to replicate while on a leash and the tension from the leash can cause reactivity in dogs, leading to aggression or fear,” DiBono explains.\nIf your pup acts diabolical on walks, you are not alone. Here’s what you can do.\nHow On-Leash Greetings Affect Your Dog in the Long-Term\nThere are far-reaching,  lingering effects of putting dogs in these types of situations. Not only will your dog potentially develop anxiety about going outside and seeing other dogs or leash-reactivity issues, but they may also lose trust in you. This can diminish your authority in communication and make training much more difficult. DiBono adds: “When the relationship between the owner and dog becomes untrustworthy, the dog begins to think they can ignore their owner and always run up to other dogs or that they can’t trust the owner to protect their boundaries.”\nDiBono explains that the ideal scenario for two dogs to meet is in a neutral and controlled environment with both animals off-leash. This can be a fenced-in yard or any enclosed space. Inviting a professional trainer to oversee the introduction, especially if the pets are unfamiliar with each other, would also be immensely helpful. Additionally, avoiding places with high stimuli, like busy parks or crowded streets, will help minimize adverse reactions. It’s also good to schedule the meetup around a time that is not mealtime or near favorite toys that dogs may feel protective over.\nKeep you and your dog safe in case of a dog fight emergency.\nHow to Make Your On-Leash Greeting Less Risky\nIf you must introduce your dog on a leash, there is a way to limit the negative consequences. DiBono recommends first walking with both dogs parallel to one another, allowing one to fall behind and sniff the other, then vice versa. After a hopefully encouraging initial meeting, he suggests going to a large enclosed space. You can then drop your leash, but DiBonos adds to not remove the leash from the dog’s collar in the event that you must intervene.\nMore than anything, if you’re out on a walk understand that you have no obligation to anyone or anyone’s dog except your own. “I would avoid all strange dogs,” DiBono says. “Your dog has no need to say hello and both dogs will be safer for it. If you take your dog in public, often it’s up to you to advocate for them and not allow others to rush them. Stick to dogs whose temperament and owners you are familiar with.”",

The truth is that these seemingly perfect puppy-hangs present a slew of possible threats to both their mental and physical health and safety.\n“While dog parks can seem like an ideal place to bring your pet for socialization and exercise, there are potential risks to consider,” says Charlie DiBono, trainer and founder ofBody and Mind K9. “If you were to take a five-minute video of dogs at a park, you are very likely to see an array of issues. From lack of boundaries, over-arousal, and dogs being bullies without their owners understanding what’s happening,” he adds.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nNew kid on the block? Follow this trainer’s tips before letting your pet run wild.\nBehavioral Issues Can Start at the Dog Park\nDiBono warns that public dog parks are often the birthplace of behavioral issues for many pups, depending on the individual dog’s temperament and previous experiences. For many, especially those prone to anxiety, the overstimulation from all those strange humans and animals running around can feel chaotic for these dogs. In response, they might become fearful, which escalates their anxiety. This is assuming every other dog in the park behaves perfectly. If your pup has a negative experience with another at the park, they may start to develop serious reservations about meeting any other dogs.\nThe concerns go beyond situations that are recognizably hostile. Per DiBono, not all dogs have compatible play styles. Although this is completely normal, it does mean that locking a bunch of dogs in an enclosed space together is probably a bad idea. Think of the dog park as the Thanksgiving dinner table and the different play styles as all of your family member’s varying political opinions; forcing them to coexist for more than a few minutes is going to cause arguments. “Some dogs may prefer to play rough and tumble, while others may prefer more gentle, subdued play,” DiBono says. “When dogs with different play styles interact, it can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts.”\nThere’s a lot more to it than sniffing each other’s butts.\nMaybe this doesn’t apply to you because your dog actually loves the park and gets wild with excitement when you pull up to one. Well, here comes some bad news: That apparent enthusiasm might be something a bit more upsetting. “As [pet parents] arrive at the park their dogs wiggle and whine to get out of the car, rush into the park, and hit full-speedzoomiesonce in the gate,” DiBono explains. “While it may look like our dogs are happy and excited, the truth is they are overstimulated and the energy they bring into the park can quickly cause a fight.”\nSome Issues Start After You Leave the Dog Park\nHe adds that even seemingly positive experiences might cause behavioral issues that start to show up once you leave the park. For example, your dog will now want to meet every dog they come across, leading toleash reactivityor pulling. Plus, in the words of all my friends’ parents growing up, you still have to worry about that bad influences. “Dogs learn very quickly from one another,” DiBono says. “You’ll find a lot of problem-behaviors are picked up from other dogs at the park, specifically things like barking, fence fighting, and digging.”\nIf it’s time for a round of shots (no, not that kind), follow this guide.\nNow, let’s say your pup is a true social chameleon unaffected by the influence or consequences of interacting with other dogs. Unfortunately, there are still physical health concerns. Back to the Thanksgiving comparison: Just like gatherings with your family since 2020, your peace is interrupted by those who aren‘t as keen on getting vaccinated. “Not all dogs at the park may be vaccinated or free of contagious diseases, and your dog could be at risk of contracting illnesses such askennel cough,parvovirus, orgiardia,” DiBono warns. He adds that pretty much any disease that is transmitted from dog to dog can be contracted at a dog park — and even fully vaccinated pups can be at risk.\nBut all hope is not lost, and you definitely don’t need to hide your pet from the world; that creates its owncatalog of problems. Instead, DiBono offers a few solutions that will minimize the risk of combative or unvaccinated encounters that’ll still provide opportunities for socialization and exercise for your pup. The first is to schedule playdates with other pet parents you’re familiar with and whose dogs you know get along with yours. Another option is to attend dog training or obedience classes. These will not only provide structuredsocializationbut also help improve behavior. Additionally, some pet stores offerdoggie daycareor indoor play areas that could be a low-risk alternative to parks, DiBono confirms.\nA new members only dog park and social club in LA is all about good dogs and good vibes.\nFor pet parents who really dig the dog park experience and are hesitant to let it go, DiBono recommendsSniffspot. The app is essentially Airbnb for dog parks, allowing users to rent land by the hour for more controlled playing. DiBono adds that there are also private parks in which all dogs are behavior-tested to limit any adverse encounters. Ultimately, when in doubt, trust your gut. “Your dog’s safety comes first. If you don’t know if the dogs you’re introducing them to are safe, it’s not worth risking it,” DiBono says.\nDOG PPL, the first “canine social club” in Los Angeles, is an example of private dog parks that are doing the work to address some of the issues with public dog parks. They require members to provide records of vaccines and spay/neuter if the dog is over eight months old. DOG PPL also has “rufferees” who monitor new members for how well they play with others. The park also offers training advice to dog parents so they can work on any issues.\n“When you’re at a dog park and you’re with the right people, a real sense of community and connection between human and dog happens there,” DOG PPL co-founder Liam Underwood told Kinship in a 2021 interview.  “It’s magical. Time gets lost sometimes when you’re around good people and good dogs. That’s what we wanted to harness — that connection.”",

  "page_content": "All dogs come equipped with powerful jaws and sharp teeth, but most save them for marrow bones, chews,or Kongs— a quality that makes for good pets and great friends. Unfortunately, your dog will likely experience unpleasant or stressful incidents at some point in their life (don’t we all?), but dogs with proper bite inhibition can consciously control their behavior and respond in a way that does not cause much (if any) damage. That’s why bite inhibition is so valuable.\nIf an injured or freaked-out dog air-snaps or inhibits their bite so effectively that contact with another dog or person causes no pain or injury, that’s a manageable problem by most people’s standards. If a dog with poor bite inhibition is in the same situation and inflicts serious damage, it’s a potentially disastrous problem from a physical, emotional, and even legal standpoint.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nWhat is bite inhibition?\nAs puppies, dogs are typically taught to control the force of their bites. The degree to which dogs learn not to use the full force of their mouths on people and other dogs is called “bite inhibition,” and it is the most important part of a dog’s education.\nAnd save your skin.\nHaving good bite inhibition doesn’t mean a dog won’tkill squirrelsortear up their chew toys. Bite inhibition is all about exercising control in social situations, but that doesn’t necessarily apply to predatory behavior or playing with objects.\nWhy teach bite inhibition?\nBite inhibition is important because if a gate is left open, a leash breaks, or a person barges in unannounced, and your dog gets scared,they could bark,lunge, or snap. How they respond depends on their training. As a result, someone could be badly and even permanently injured, require medical care, such as surgery, or be deeply traumatized by an untrained dog. As a pet parent, you must be committed to working with your dog to improve their behavior. If you think your dog wouldn’t respond in such a manner, consider the following incidents from my own case files.\nA visiting child loses his temper when the family dog distracts him during a game of ping-pong by yawning and whining. The child hits the dog in the face with the ping-pong paddle, and the dog runs away yelping. A teenager tries to dress up her dog to match her own outfit, and the dog resists. As she continues forcing the clothes on him, he whines and struggles. After several minutes, the dog growls andsnaps at her facebut makes no contact. A toddler tries to climb on her sleeping dog to ride him like a horse. The dog stands up and begins to walk away, but when she tries once again to get on his back, he bites her on the shoulder, causing a bruise.\nStep one: Never put your face close to theirs.\nAn elderly man trips and falls onto his dog while the dog is eating. The dog bites the man on the leg, leaving no mark. When a man reaches to pet his friend’s dog, his watch catches on the dog’s collar. He gently tries to disentangle himself, and the dog bites him on the leg, leaving two puncture marks and some bruising. A woman walks into her dining room, sees a dog toy under the table and reaches down to get it. Her dog, exhibiting extremeresource guarding, races in and bites her arm repeatedly, resulting in multiple punctures along with fractures to her wrist and arm that require several surgeries to fix.\nIt’s easy to see how a dog might become distressed. Yet, the dogs in each case responded differently, and the seriousness was not directly related to the injustice or pain suffered by the dog, but rather, to the dog’s ability to exercise proper bite inhibition. It’s no exaggeration to say that bite inhibition can be the difference between success and failure in treating behavior problems and even between life and death for the dog.\nEarly experiences\nExperience with play-biting and mouthing often leads to better bite inhibition, and like anything else, those who practice become the most skilled. Littermates are a puppy’s first teachers, one of several reasons that it’s beneficial for puppies to stay with their litter for about two months. As the young dogs play, they use their mouths to tug or gnaw on their siblings’ ears, tails, paws, and loose skin. If one puppy mouths another too hard, the puppy who got hurt will yelp, stop playing, and move away. This teaches puppies that hard bites, even if not intended to cause pain, result in an interruption in play.Singleton puppiesand those taken from their litter before the age of five or six weeks often lack proper bite inhibition. It seems that puppies need their littermates’ feedback to learn to control the pressure they exert with their mouths.\nOne doesn’t have to be the loneliest number when it comes to your dog.\nOnce puppies head to new homes, their education needs to continue, and that includes socialization with other puppies and dogs. This does not mean throwing a puppy into the dog-park fray and hoping it will all work out. In that setting, puppies are far too likely to be overwhelmed and to experience it as we might experience a gladiator pit. Rather, it means supervised play dates with carefully selected and well-behaved canines.\nTeaching bite inhibition\nLessons from people are also useful in teaching bite inhibition. Although using their mouths on our hands, arms, legs, hair, and clothes is natural behavior for them, dogs must learn to interact in ways that are appropriate in your world.\nAn effective technique, one based on puppies’ earlier experiences with their littermates, is to startle and then redirect the young offender. If a puppy mouths too hard, yelp with a puppy-like sound (Aaarp! is the closest description of this sound that can be spelled), which often interrupts the puppy’s biting. Take advantage of that pause in the behavior by immediately giving the puppy something appropriate to chew on. Good options include bones, chew toys, Kongs, squeaky toys, and stuffed animals.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nBegin by startling and redirecting the puppy only in response to the most forceful bites. Employing this approach with every instance of mouthing can be overwhelming to the puppy, who is, after all, doing what comes naturally and exploring the world by mouth. So, the first goal is to teach the puppy not to mouth so hard rather than not to mouth at all.\nWhen the hardest bites have been inhibited, the next step is to startle and redirect after medium-force bites. Spend time working at each level to ensure that your dog has a firm understanding.\nFinally, once the puppy has learned to mouth people with only the gentlest of pressure, teach them not to do this at all by employing the same technique in response to any occasion in which their teeth touch delicate human skin, hair, or clothes.\nA common mistake when using this method is to make the yelping sound and then fail to redirect the puppy. In most cases, although the sound will startle the puppy into a break in the mouthing, they will go right back to it unless given another, more appropriate object to focus on. Many people begin by doing both steps (startle and redirect), but as time goes on, they switch to startling without bothering to redirect. It’s important to stay consistent.\nA dog behaviorist schools us on why puppy classes are more about socializing than getting straight As.\nWhile more than 90 percent of puppies will respond to this method if it is used correctly and consistently, some dogs seem to get worse in response to high-pitched yelps, becoming even mouthier and more revved up. For those dogs, it’s usually effective to startle the dog with a deep-voiced “Hey!” or “Ouch!” Otherwise, the technique of interrupting the behavior and then redirecting the dog to an appropriate object is the same. If the puppy fails to respond to either sound, walk away so that they learn that biting brings an end to the fun.\nMouthing myths\nThere are many recommendations out there for stopping puppy mouthing, and I advise against most of them because they are inhumane and generally ineffective.Do nothold the dog’s muzzle closed, yell at the dog, jam your fingers into the dog’s mouth, or swat the dog. Basically, it comes down to one piece of general advice: Don’t do anything that involves any kind of physical punishment that causes pain or frightens the dog.\nProper bite inhibition is incredibly important, and developing it requires lessons early in life. The normal process of learning bite inhibition is linked with puppy development and it can’t usually be learned later in life with the same degree of success. Dogs without this essential skill may cause severe damage — punctures, painful bruising, and even broken bones on occasion. Learning bite inhibition is one of the first and most essential lessons for puppies because it is about safety as well as being a well-behaved, polite member of society.",

  "page_content": "You know when your dog is happy or playful, when they desperately want a bite of your snack or a leisurely walk around the neighborhood. You know their expressions and their moods and could easily pick your pup out of a lineup of similar-looking dogs. You may even pride yourself on knowing your dog better than you know anyone else. And if you wake up every day thinking that your human friends might be mad at you for some reason (as many millennials do), at least you can always count on dogs to be on your side. Right?Right?\nThe reality is you may not know your dog quite as well as you think you do. ADecember 2022 studyled by the DogStudies research group at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology found that humans aren’t the best atrecognizing aggression in dogs— or even in other humans. This lack of recognition can lead to serious danger, especially when approaching a strange dog.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nKinship spoke to Dr. Juliane Bräuer, DogStudies Research Group Leader and senior author of the research article, to explore why you may be misinterpreting one of your dog’s biggest emotions.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nThe study explored humans’ ability to classify interactions and predict outcomes.\nResearchers showed 92 participants videos of nonverbal interactions between pairs of humans, dogs, and primates. The participants were split into two groups, with one group categorizing the interactions in the 27 videos as playful, neutral, or aggressive, and the other group predicting the outcome of each social interaction.\nThe participants managed to predict accurate outcomes in 50 percent to 80 percent of the videos. But their ability to identify behaviors and predict what would happen next largely depended on whether the participants were viewing a video of primates, dogs, or humans. In fact, to the researchers’ surprise, participants in the study performed especially poorly when it came to recognizing aggressive interactions in both dogs and their fellow humans.\nDr. Bräuer notes, however, that the results of the study are a bit more complicated than they appear at first glance. While participants may have struggled with categorizing the video interactions, they were much better at predicting emotions, which is more crucial in an evolutionary sense than simply identifying emotions.\nWant help with your pet's behavior right now?

For under $5/month.\nRecognizing aggression is not humans’ strong suit.\nThe experimenters involved in the study expected their subjects to have no problem recognizing aggression in dogs. After all, dogs are known as man’s best friend for a reason, and our long history of interacting with canines should suggest that we are able to read their emotions and body language fairly well.\nBut on this count, researchers were proven wrong. In fact, participants performed especially poorly when it came to spotting aggressive interactions, regardless of whether they were dog parents or not. In past similar studies, Dr. Bräuer says, researchers have found that dog parents have no advantage over non-parents when it comes to recognizing aggression.\n“We know that dogs are very good at reading humans,” Dr. Bräuer says, noting that this is a skill that dogs have developed over time throughout their evolution from wolves. “But we’re not only bad at recognizing aggression; we’re also bad at predicting what’s happening in a playful interaction, where it’s not so clear. For example, maybe one of the dogs didn’t mean to be aggressive, but the other dog perceived it that way.”\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nThankfully, we’re not too shabby when it comes to understanding dogs’ more obviously playful intentions with each other and can generally tell play-fighting from the real deal. So, when you see your pupmake a new friendat the dog park, you’re probably easily able to tell if things are going well. However, humans tend to underestimate aggression in dogs, unless the emotion is severe, such as when a dog is snarling or offeringwarning growls.\nOur love for our pups (and all dogs) may cause bias.\nResearchers theorize that one reason we may struggle to recognize aggression is simply because we love dogs and assume the best of any canine we see, regardless of what their expressions and body language may tell us.\n“We have this picture that we are nice humans, and these are nice, cute, little dogs,” Dr. Bräuer says. “We expect the best of both dogs and humans.”If you’re like most pet parents, you’re constantly snapping photos of your precious pup and speaking to them in a baby voice that would embarrass you if anyone heard it. So, maybe it’s no surprise that our love for dogs could keep us from realizing when they’re truly angry.\nThis body language is not as simple as you probably think.\nDogs express aggression in a variety of ways, including growling, barking, and snarling, and sometimes even their play with other dogs can seem violent. But playful dogs tend to avoid biting down on their playmates or even roll over on their backs or let themselves be caught during an intense chase. Genuinely aggressive dogs, however, show no signs of backing down, and their bite is often much worse than their bark.\nWe’re Also Not Great at Reading Human Aggression\nMaybe the most surprising part of the study is the revelation that humans aren’t even skilled in recognizing aggression ineach other. Just as bias may blind us to the genuine feelings of canines, we may automatically assume the best of our fellow man as well. So, unless someone is obviously angry with you (we’re talking screaming and cursing), you may miss the signs of aggression even in people around you.\n“With severe aggression, no matter the species, we’re good at recognizing it,” Dr. Bräuer says. “When it’s more subtle, then it starts to be more difficult.”No matter how much you love your dog or dogs in general (it’s probablya lot), it’s important to understandhow they communicateso you can better meet their needs and speak in their language. Love can certainly bridge the divide between you and your dog, but it never hurts to learn a little more about your four-legged best friend — which will only help you translate that love into body language (and plenty of pets and kisses).",

  },
  "page_content": "Having a dog can be one of the best things in the world, but it can also be scary and downright frustrating at times. As parents, we all have a vision in mind of what we want our dogs to be like. We want them to listen, be well-behaved, and to exhibit the traits that we associate with a well-trained dog. But many dog parents struggle to get these goals conquered and often find themselves being frustrated with their dog’s behaviors, especially if these naughty behaviors take place in public. If this resonates with you, don’t worry. I see this a lot, you’re not alone, and it’s nothing to be ashamed of.\nThe problem is that we often approach our dogs’ behaviors from the wrong perspective. Instead of focusing on what we want our dogs to do, we focus on what we don’t want them to do. This is especially true when it comes to negative behaviors, such asjumping on people,pulling on the leash,barking, ordigging. Many try to stop their dogs’ choices by scolding them.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nThis study says it’s actually less about what’sintheir DNA and more about what’sonit.\nBut this approach is both ineffective and damaging. Punishing your dog for a behavior that you don’t like will only create fear and anxiety and will not address the underlying cause of the behavior — which could befear,anxiety, or confusion over what you’re asking them to do. In fact, by doing this, you can even make the behavior worse; your dog may start to associate the punishment with you, rather than with the behavior itself.\nChange the Way You’re Thinking\nFor us to succeed with training, we often need to reframe the way we think about our dogs’ behaviors. Instead of focusing on the negatives, we need to focus on the positives and the goal. We need to think about what we want our dogs to do and how we can reinforce that behavior. To repeat that one more time,reward the desired behavior you want and replace that behavior with the behavior you don’t want.\nTo do this, we need to understand our dogs’ motivations and behavior patterns. Often if we can identify what triggers the negative behavior, we can find a way to redirect that energy into a positive behavior. For example, if your dog barks when they see another dog, you can train them to sit and stay quiet at a distance as soon as they see the dog butbeforethey start to bark. You can then reward them withtreats, praise, and attention for exhibiting the desired behavior of sitting and staying quiet. Remember, it’s important you start this before the action of barking occurs.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nA big part of this is mental; once you master that, it will start to click and also change your frustration, which will help grow your bond. So, instead of getting mad or frustrated with your dog, think about what you would rather your dog be doing. Let’s go over a few examples:\nOriginal: My dog needs to stop jumping on friends who come over.New thinking: My dog should sit at the front door when people come over to be greeted.\nOriginal: I’m upset that my dog keepsgrabbing food off the counterswhen I’m cooking.New thinking: My dog needs to stay on the mat in the kitchen when I’m in there.\nRemember, Your Dog Is a Toddler\nThis might take a moment at first, and that’s OK. Another important aspect of reframing our mindsets as pet parents is to understand that setbacks and frustrations are a completely normal part of the training process. Training a dog is not a one-time event, but a continuous process of learning and growth together. Just like with any other skill, it takes time and patience for these new behaviors to become routine to our pet, but the more we reward the desired behaviors, the behaviors we don’t want to occur will happen less and less.\nDon’t forget: You’re pretty much dealing with a toddler. Although our dogs may be exceptionally talented in performing tricks or completing agility courses, their mental capacity is roughly equivalent to that of a two-to-five-year-old child. While we may value our dogs for their reliability, medical alertness, and communication abilities throughbuttons, we must keep in mind that their cognitive abilities are very similar to that of young kids. Therefore, we must make sure to set them up for success in various situations as we would a toddler.\nIt’s important to remember that dogs are individuals, so training isn’t one-size-fits-all.\nWould you let a three-year-old wander around a dinner party and expect that child to behave themselves? No, you wouldn’t. So, at that same dinner party you’d need to give your dog the skills to succeed, too. Maybe that’s being onleashwhen first meeting all the arriving guests or being tethered with astuffed Kongon adog bedright near me so they stay a bit occupied.\nWould you leave a toddler in the kitchen with a big chocolate cake within reach? Of course not. You also wouldn’t leave meat and tasty items that a dog finds valuable on the counter within reach of their paws or mouth. Instead, you are there to monitor your dog and reward them for staying in their designated “place.”\nReframing our mindset as dog parents is key to successful training. By focusing on the positives, understanding our dogs’ motivations and behavior patterns, and being patient with the process, we can create a deeper connection and relationship with our pups.",

  "page_content": "Has your dog ever looked at you andsighedlike they have the weight of the world on their shoulders? As we sift through more tax forms to pay the government yet again, it’s hard not to roll our eyes. What should they, whose biggest problem is choosing the right spot in the living room to chew their bully stick, have to worry about? In truth, your dog probably isn’t complaining about all of life’s burdens; they’re just bored.\nDogs are intelligent, social, and emotional beings who, yes, can get easily bored. Providing a pup with a high quality of life depends heavily on enrichment. Enrichment can take many forms: There’s social time with other dogs and other people; tasks that make pups feel important for having a job; sensory enrichment, such as stimulating sight, sound, or smell; and nutritional enrichment — which doesn’t mean richer food — it means giving the dog a food-toy that challenges how quickly and easily they can scarf their dinner down.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nOn the physical enrichment end, it’s important that toys and activities encourage a positive expression of natural behaviors. For example, Terriers love to dig, so an outdoor sandbox will stop them from digging through your carpet. All these aspects of the dog’s environment keep dogs in good physical and psychological condition and keep them from emitting yet another long, drawn-out sigh.\nWoof’s innovative fillable design will help dogs de-stress and their parents save money.\nIs My Dog Bored?\nBored dogs will do things you don’t want them to (does that hole in your favorite cozy couch blanket ring a bell?). Without your constructive direction, dogs will often make up their own amusements that don’t amuse you. Signs that your dog is bored are: barking or biting for attention, getting in the trash, destructive chewing, jumping, and lots of other mischiefs. They might also sleep more, sigh, or be on alert. Truly, there’s no creature on earth more creative than a frustrated pup.\nHow to Help a Bored Dog\nThere are many ways to bring joy into your dog’s day besides feeding them treats and asking, “Who’s a good doggo?!” Dogs need so much stimulus because their wild canine ancestors faced puzzles and challenges every day in their search for food, water, and shelter. We have all those things covered for our pups, but that brain energy needs to go somewhere. Here are some suggestions for channeling that energy in an appropriate way for the whole household’s sake.\nLike your Peloton instructor has probably told you as you turn the dial to add resistanceonce again, there’s nothing like exercise to boost serotonin and endorphin production, and a simpledog walkdoes a lot to increase physical activity and stimulation for your dog. It can also benefit the dog in terms of social interaction, meeting other dogs and friendly people along the way. You might make a friend, too.\nBad weather? These activities will keep your dog (and you!) from going stir crazy.\nIf you can’t get a long walk in, try a “flirt-pole.” A flirt pole is a simple tool to help you drag a toy on the ground in a circle to be chased and tugged by the dog. Flirt poles are super easy toDIY at home. Ten minutes of toy chase with a flirt pole will work out the dog without tiring you, fulfill their naturalprey instinct, and work on your dog’s cue response skills. When in a state of high arousal through chasing and tugging, your dog can practice listening to you and cooling off quickly. That means dropping the toy and lying down when you ask them to. Doing this before you go out is a great option because it helps them relax and expel some anxiety.\nMental enrichment lowers stress levels and keeps dogs from getting bored and starting unwanted behaviors at home. Animate (social interaction) and inanimate (toys, puzzles,scent work) enrichment might even prevent certain behaviors that have already presented from getting worse.\nCue theSchoolhouse Rock!because learning can be fun.\nYou can keep your dog from getting bored with the help oftoys, but it is really important to rotate them. Dogs will lose interest in the same toy after a short period of time — dogs are very similar to kids that way. Start by putting toys away after youplay together, and only offer your dog two or three at a time. Leave them around for a couple of days before removing them and replacing them with something else from the toy box. This will keep the dog interested in the novelty of their toy collection.\nOne of the most popular dog games istug-of-war, and there are somemisconceptionsabout whether or not the dog should ever “win” the game. Research does not show that dogs become more pushy or aggressive when allowed to play tug and win. But, if your dog has already shown a tendency to want to control items by growling or snapping, it is probably not a game to play with them. Some dogs are simply not interested in tugging, and that’s fine, too.\nScatter your dog’s food in the yard or around the house instead of feeding them from a bowl, encouraging more time eating and exercising natural feeding behaviors. You can help your dog by pointing to the place where thefood is hidden. Assuming the dogs don’t have resource-guarding issues, scattering food may also work well in multi-dog households; dogs have shown they are able to communicate information about hidden resources to other dogs.\nDon’t hit pause on your pet’s playtime – these solo activities will help 9-5 fly by for them.\nMusic can be used as sensory enrichment. Classicalmusicfor companion animals have even been developed because, although the mechanism underlying this effect is not well understood, studies show that classical music reduces stress levels and increases resting and sleeping in dogs.\nAuditory stimuli may be enriching, but its use depends on how your dog reacts to it. The sound should not be on all the time because even pets need a break from noise, and volume should be kept low. Most importantly, the sound should be tailored to the needs of your dog as much as possible. Many sounds that are pleasant to humans may be displeasing or distressful to dogs. Most of the time, a selection of gentle classical music, soft pop or call-in radio shows will do the trick of keeping your dog in good company, stimulating their senses and lowering stress levels.\nIn addition to the stimulation that a dog gets from interacting with a toy,chewingreleases feel-good chemicals in the brain, which keeps dogs happy, busy, and using up energy. Chewing is a tool that dogs have at their disposal to self-medicate for anxiety, boredom and/or stress and can produce a sense of euphoria and calmness.\nToys to Keep Dogs Busy\nWhat toys are best for bored dogs? There are plenty to choose from butchoosing toyscan be tricky: Always select the correct size because an item that is too small can lodge in the dog’s throat or be swallowed. Check for small parts that can be chewed off and become choking hazards or create blockages in the intestines. When introducing a new toy, supervise the dog’s initial interactions and check the toy periodically to make sure it’s still in safe shape. An additional warning — some dogs can become protective of toys and even aggressive. If that happens, reach out to a qualified behaviorist to deal with the situation. So they don’t chew on your belongings, here’s a list of solitary toys that’ll keep your pup entertained:\nChews, such as pig ears, bully sticks, and dental bones. Look for all-natural chews made in the United States, size the chew to the dog, keep an eye on the dog while they’re chewing, and dispose of the chew when it’s small enough to be swallowed.\nTwo experts—a veterinary dentist and internist—rate the most popular dog bones.\nFood-dispensingballsare probably the most useful group of toys for solitary play. The dog rolls them around to release food. There are also balls that need to be chewed and manipulated, such as the Everlasting Treat Ball and the Orka ball.\nBehaviorist Karen London shares her list of must-have toys for dogs.\nFood pyramids and cubes, such asKong, Squirrel Dude, and Buster Cubes. During the summer months, freeze a Kong stuffed with wet dog food, pieces of meat floating in stock, or vegetables covered with some water. (A word of advice: make sure you seal the Kong’s openings with some cheese and place it in a Ziploc bag to keep it separate from other foods in the freezer.) Puppies, who usually need additional entertainment and appropriate direction when it comes to chewing, can be fed their entire meal with these toys.\nTwo words: Endless entertainment.\nPuzzlesfrom Nina Ottosson and the Aikiou brands are great for your bright and active puppy. If your dog needs encouragement, make the toys more appealing by rubbing something tasty on them, such aspeanut butter. When you first introduce your dog to these toys, make it easy for them to obtain the treats, then gradually increase the difficulty so that your dog learns how to work persistently to extract the food. Otherwise, your dog may get frustrated, leading to the opposite of what we intend to do through enrichment and stimulation.\nLet the games begin.\nNo need to spend zillions on toys — you can make them yourself. Nest different-sized cardboard boxes, with all staples and tape removed, inside each other, then put a treat in the smallest box. Or use a solid cardboard tube with a few holes to turn it into an exciting food dispenser. Try hiding dry food inside toilet paper tubes, egg cartons, boxes from cereals, and so forth.\nTips for pet parents who want their pups to have safe fun.\nWhy Do Dogs Get Bored?\nWhen a dog gets tired of a certain repeated activity, that’s called habituation. Research has shown that introducing novel activities will keep them engaged with play. In one of these studies, a bacon-bubble machine and a playhouse resulted in the greatest behavior changes. These were both new activities for the dogs in the study, but a bubble machine that smells like bacon would be interesting to anyone.\nThe liquid bubbles pups are obsessed with.\nAs with anything in this life, too much or too little will not do the trick. Beware of overstimulation. While stimulating your dog mentally and physically is the goal, overstimulation may increasestress levels. Think of a ball-obsessed dog, such as a Border Collie, bringing their favorite toy and dropping it at their person’s feet over and over again with no off-button. Individual preferences and circumstances must be kept in mind. Spend time identifying things that your dog finds motivating or reinforcing, and adjust playtime routines before your dog reaches a frustration level.",

And if this is happening with your puppy, you’re not alone. We’ve all be there.A biting puppy isn’t the same thing as an aggressive puppy, which is a common misconception. (Yes, puppies can be aggressive, but 98 percent of the time I’ve found it’s not the case.) Puppies play and communicate with their mouths, and biting can also feel really good to them. Unfortunately, being on the receiving end of those little shark teeth doesn’t feelasgood to us.\nHonestly, this teething stage — along withpotty training— can be one of the most frustrating things about the adorable puppy months. So let’s go over how to minimize puppy biting right from the start.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nHow to teach your pup to play nice.\nBasic Management\nI don’t let my puppies free-roam the house until they prove they won’t have an accident and won’t be chewing on household objects. If your pup is sneaking off and chewing on table legs and other items, it’s time to keep them tethered to you until this behavior stops.\nKeep a Toy Rotation\nBoredom is another cause of destructive chewing. Puppies are active by nature. Ensure you’re doing a mix of training and activity as well as providing a mix ofmental enrichment toysand games daily — plus some safe puppy playdates. I rotate the puppy-safe toys in my house to keep the dogs busy and prevent boredom from setting in. I’m a huge fan of stuffingKongswith kibble, goat’s milk, and other delicious goodies for them to chew on.\nPresent Them With an Appropriate Item\nWhen you catch your dog chewing on something they shouldn’t, like the furniture or perhapsyou, tell them “no” and get an appropriate item for them to chew. Make this item exciting; you can drag it on the ground, squeak it, or throw it.\nBut we should also keep an eye on what they’re chewing because there might be a reason why they’ve chosen that object. Maybe it feels good on their gums and new teeth. If that’s the case, make a trade for a similar-feeling object. If they’re chewing clothes or socks, I’ll get a soft toy or a soft tug toy.\nWhenever you are selecting a toy or something permissible for a puppy or an adult dog to play with or chew, consider the safety of their teeth. The enamel on dog’s teeth is much thinner than the enamel on human teeth and is therefore much more easily damaged. Always think to yourself, if you wouldn’t bite down on something, then neither should your dog. Choose rubberized toys or rope toys. Edible chews or chew toys need to be able to flex; if the item is too hard when the dog bites on it, it will sadly be the dog’s tooth that gets damaged, not the item. This also applies to sticks, stones, bones, and antlers, all of which are too hard and can cause teeth to fracture so supervision to ensure they don’t pick them up when out and about if essential.\nReward, Reward, Reward\nDon’t forget to reward correct chew choices. If they’re chewing an appropriate toy, either on their own or because I gave it to them, it’s important to tell them how good they are. Unfortunately, humans often overlook the positive-reinforcement aspect of chewing; remind yourself to praise good chewing behavior.\nWatch the Clock\nA puppy might also get mouthy when they’re tired or hungry. It just might be that it’s close to feeding time or that the puppy needs a nap. Pay attention to the times of day when this seems to happen, so that you can plan ahead. For example, do they always get excited and go crazy at 4 p.m.? If so, at 3:45 I would get out the fun toys or go for a walk and help them expel some of that energy in more acceptable ways. The more we make other play a good habit, the more predictable and harmonious our life with the puppy will be.\nHow We Play Matters\nWe should talk about play, too. Play is great and healthy for puppies and dogs of all ages. By making toys rewarding and fun, we can encourage play with appropriate objects. I always have some puppy-safe toys easily available to my puppies at all times.\nI’m also careful of my mannerisms when playing with puppies, especially mouthy ones. Avoid playing with your hands or letting your dog bite them during play. Even if the bites are gentle and playful, allowing any hand biting at all can confuse the puppy. You don’t want your puppy to grow up thinking they can bite someone’s hands, even for play. This could be harmful to small children or older people.\nDo they need to go outside?\nDo they need to go outside?\nAre they overly tired? Due for a nap?\nAre they overly tired?

  },
  "page_content": "If your dog is the most loving, affectionate, agreeable dog ever, is it because of the perfect early socialization you provided? Is it due to the constant attention you gave them in the first month, even if it did cost youallyour vacation time? Is it good genes that deserve the credit? And if your dog has some serious issues — extreme fear,high reactivity,a tendency touse their mouthon everything from your arms to the furniture to the laundry in the basket — is it because you skipped some puppy walks when the weather was bad? Do those behaviors come from early trauma that happened before you adopted them? Do genes deserve the blame for these issues?\nOh, how we all want the answers to these questions. I mean, what dog parents wouldn’t give just about anything to know what makes their dogs who they are? The short answer to the question about what makes dogs who they are is that there are a lot of factors, and the full answer is a long story about the many variables that influence who our dogs are and what they do.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nDog DNA and Behavior: What It All Means\nScientific research continues to explore those variables, and arecent articlein the journalFrontiers in Psychologypoints to the chemicals that are attached to the dog’s DNA as one factor that explains differences in behavior between dogs. That’s interesting because it isnotthe genes themselves (the dog’s genome) that the researchers looked at, but rather at the dogs’ “epigenome.”\nThe epigenome is the full set of modifications that regulate the expression and activity of genes, and that includes chemicals attached to their DNA. These chemicals are not the DNA (the dog’s genetics) itself. They are chemicals that are acquired by each dog during development and during their life, but not inherited from their parents. The unique set of chemical tags hanging on to each dog’s DNA makes up their epigenome, and it has a huge effect on the dog. In this study, researchers looked specifically at methylation, which involves the attachment of methyl groups (one carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms) to DNA. Interestingly, methylation can be affected by the environment, especially by pollution and toxins.\nIt’s important to remember that dogs are individuals, so training isn’t one-size-fits-all.\nMethylation may sound trivial, but it can influence all kinds of things, such as the production of neurotransmitters, metabolism of fats and other substances, eye and liver health, cellular energy, and detoxification — all of which can affect behavior. The reason for the strong influence on all kinds of physical and behavioral traits is that methylation affects which genes are “turned on and off” or expressed.\nThe Epigenetics of It All\nSo, while the epigenome is not the dog’s genes, the epigenome influences the expression of those genes. The association of variation in DNA methylation and behavioral traits suggests that differences in theexpressionof genes may contribute to certain canine behaviors. But this is not the same thing at all as thepresenceof certain genes being responsible.\nBased on chemical analyses and surveys by pet parents in the current study, we know that methylation is associated with energy levels of dogs and on the fearful behavior they show towards strangers. There is still more research to be done on the additional aspects of behaviors that are affected by dogs’ epigenetics.\nNot all fearful dogs have been mistreated.\nEpigenetics has been described as the system by which experience influences the activities of our genes and also as the last nail in the coffin of genetic determinism. In other words, even though genes influence who dogs become, genesalonedo not determine their behavior, and the genes do not trap them into a particular way of being.\nThe researchers summarize the importance of their research by writing: “In conclusion, we propose that energy and stranger-directed fear are partially predictable by DNA methylation in dogs. These behavioral associations are of interest because they provide evidence that changes in methylation can impact personalities, energy levels, and other aspects of behavior. Since methylation is dynamic and can be influenced by environmental factors, in the future we might be able to modify canine behavior by modulating these factors.”\nEverything you need to know to get your new addition off to a good start.\nScience-speak aside, we all want to know why our dogs are who they are. Every dog is different in their personality, behavior, and temperament. Future studies of epigenetics may help us learn more about why dogs act as they do, allow us to screen dogs for suitability as service dogs or for temperament generally, and modify behavior by actively targeting methylation.",

  },
  "page_content": "It’s been three years (count ’em) since we were all told to stay inside our homes for an indefinite amount of time. During that excruciatingly confusing period, we told ourselves we loved to bake bread, do puzzles, and, most of all, that we were OK — insert always-relevant “this is fine” meme here. The one thing that was actually good about staying home for months on end was our dogs.\nWhen they realized we were never leaving, they rewarded us with extra snuggle time and lots of opportunities of taking photos of them sleeping like baby angels. But, now that many of us are back in the office and just generally living our lives because society demands it, our dogs are left to cope on their own, which results in, yes, you guessed it,separation anxiety. And my dog Emma definitely has a pretty serious case of it.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nDesperate to help Emma, I brought in multiple dog trainers, consulted four vets, cooked her food from scratch, gave her interactive food toys, and played calming music. I even hired a doggie masseuse. Results? Her separation anxiety only got worse: She didn’t stop barking, pacing, and peeing on the floor when I left. She even started chewing at my doorframe. Thankfully, there was a solution to my and Emma’s problem, and (a plus for your nervous pup) they didn’t include either of us having to leave the house.\nIt’s 2023, and the office is calling. How can our dogs cope?\nThe Shift Toward Online Dog Training\nMalena DeMartini — a California-based dog trainer and graduate of theAcademy for Dog Trainersunder the guidance of Jean Donaldson — has focused solely on separation-anxiety cases. Over time, she has become one of the leading experts (if nottheleading expert) on the condition. By using technology (smartphones, tablets, laptops, cameras), she is also transforming the way dogs, in general, are trained.\nDeMartini and the 20-plus separation-anxiety trainers she has certified do not work with clients in person. Instead, they do the job online: meet via apps such as Zoom or FaceTime and create and share spreadsheets so clients know exactly how to train their dogs each day. The team even reviews video footage with clients to teach them how to read their dogs’ body language. Training online also offsets the complication of bringing someone into the home when the goal is to help the dog handle timealone.\nDeMartini began offering onlineseparation-anxietytraining in 2008, saving her time and energy and, more importantly, allowing her to observe a dog in real time. Rather than review what went on after the fact, she could modify the training protocol online as the behavior was in progress.\nTrain your dog to stay calm when they’re on their own — instead of sad-singing“All By Myself”until you come home.\nCreating an Individualized Separation Anxiety Plan\nWorking with one of DeMartini’s trainers, Caryn Liles, who lives in Toronto, we began our online training sessions. I stacked books on a chair facing the front door and set my MacBook on top while Liles observed Emma while I went for a walk outside. The tiny pup had a threshold of 10 seconds — meaning Emma could only handle being alone in the house for 10 seconds. That was our starting point.\nUntil completing the separation-anxiety protocol, Emma could only be left alone in the house during her training sessions. “The first goal is to teach the dog, ‘Hey, you know what? You’re okay for a full second of being left alone, or three seconds,’” DeMartini says. And once they get to that point, they’re like, ‘The sky didn’t fall! Amazing!’” The training wouldn’t work if, for example, their pet parent then drove away and caught a two-hour movie. Note: When we do want to catch a movie or go out to dinner, my husband and I have recruited friends and pet sitters to keep Emma company. (For dogs who enjoy spending time with other pups,doggie daycarecan be a great option; unfortunately, Emma’s not a fan.)\nThe morning following that assessment meeting, Liles sent me a Google Sheet titled “Mission One,” a series of 12 exercises that started with the following:\nOpen front door one inch, close it, return.\nOpen front door one inch, close it, return.\nStand outside the front door for one second, return.\nStand outside the front door for one second, return.\nOpen the door one inch, close it, return.\nOpen the door one inch, close it, return.\nStand outside for one second, return.\nStand outside for one second, return.\nTurn door handle, return.\nTurn door handle, return.\nWe asked both animal behaviorists and human psychologists howyoucan deal with leaving your dog home alone.\nAt the start of each exercise, I grabbed my keys and purse from the kitchen and then put them back upon my return. I was instructed to wait 60 to 90 seconds between each exercise, at which point I would type into the spreadsheet a description of Emma’s behavior during my absence and what her recovery looked like.\nWhile outside, I watch Emma on my iPhone through a camera mounted above the fireplace. If you have multiple smartphones or tablets, another option is to use an app that turns one device into a video camera and allows you to watch on another.\nMaking Quick Progress\nEach day, Liles reviews the previous mission and then creates a new one based on the results. We repeated Mission One for seven days before graduating tofive whole secondsout the door on Mission Two.\n“I teach a dog to be relaxed in incredibly small increments,” DeMartini says about her training protocol. “People initially have a sort of pushback, if you will, like, ‘Oh, my gosh, we’re starting with one second? What? This is crazy! It’s gonna be the year 2037 before I ever leave my dog!’”\nThankfully, it doesn’t take a decade for most dogs to be desensitized to being alone, thoughsome dogs need medicationto help them relax enough to succeed, and some, unfortunately, can never get past theirfear. Most of DeMartini’s clients complete training somewhere in the three-to six-month range (meaning the dog can handle being alone for four or five hours). But DeMartini hesitates to give time estimates. Each dog is different, and anxiety level does not necessarily predict speed.\nIt was a trick question. A study shows that the pandemic has made us all codependent.\nTraining Emma on her separation-anxiety fears is also improving her fears in other areas, too. By not losing it every time the front door creaks open, Emma has gained confidence overall. She no longer cocks an ear and furrows her brow when a construction crew bangs outside or televised gunshots ring out in surround sound. And rather thanshake in terror in the car, Emma now puts her nose up to the window opening. When I glance over at Emma, flopped on her side napping peacefully in a sun patch on the rug, I know that we’re making progress.",

    "title": "Humping. Why, Though?!",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/humping-why-do-dogs-do-it"
  },
  "page_content": "Although we’d love to say we adore absolutely everything about our pups, the act of dog humping definitely falls into the “least adorable” category. Dogs hump the air, they mount pillows and blankets, and they can be found poised behind the neighbor’s dog or befriending Uncle Joe’s leg. (What won’t dogs hump?) Pet parents hypothesize that sex, breed, age, reproductive status, and even size might provide information about humpers. Most of these hypotheses culminate in questions  —  “Why do female dogs hump? Aren’t males the humpers?” —  or impressions, anything from “It’s just play” or “She’s dominant” to “He’s quite popular!” Apart from giving humping dogs silly nicknames like “the humping bean” or “Sir-humps-a-lot,” what’sbehindall of this bumping and grinding?\nWhy Do Dogs Hump?\nFrom tail wagging to barking, dog behavior is riddled with nuance. A dog’swagging tailmight convey “I’m quite scared” or “This is the best day ever!” Similarly, the reason why dogs hump is far more complex than it may appear, and there is not one simple explanation — but there are some likely culprits.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nAs you might expect, animal behavior researchers have a lot to say on the topic. For nearly as long as ethologists have studied dogs, they have taken note of their tendency to hump outside of reproductive contexts. Okay, so why do dogs hump things? “It’s what dogs do. It’s a completely normal behavior,” explains Carolyn Walsh, PhD, associate professor of psychology at Memorial University of Newfoundland, who studies the nuances of dog behavior in dog parks. “Both males and females mount, regardless of whether [they are] sexually intact or not.”\nWhether your dog is a leg humper or they’re an air humper, it’s all normal. Peter Borchelt, PhD, and Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB) in New York City, reminds us, “There are only so many behaviors a dog has access to, and dogs do what is part of their species-typical behavior. It is something they know how to do.” Since their options are somewhat limited, a dog, rather than scroll Instagram during downtime, might be inclined to get to know a stuffed animal a little better.\nIn moderation, it’s normal. Excessively? It’s not.\nIn many cases, mounting is related to a surge of emotion, such as feeling anxious or being aroused (in this context, “arousal” means general stimulation). In an investigation of dog park behavior, Walsh found that the dogs doing the most mounting were also doing the most playing. Walsh explains, “Dog parks can be quite stimulating, and for those who are highly aroused physiologically, mounting behavior could easily come out. There can be such a buildup of social motivation and the desire to affiliate that some of that energy spills over into the sexual motivation system. You see sexual behavior coming out, but it’s mostly out of context.” A dog’s general arousal or anxiety is not restricted to the dog park. Stimulation easily translates to everyday situations: a new person comes over, a new dog is introduced or a dog is cooped up in the house all day.\nDawn Cleary, owner of Blue Cerebus Dog Boutique in Madison, Ind., attributes mounting exhibited by one of her Golden Retrievers to excitement. “When myFrisbeechamp catches the Frisbee, my littlest one likes to run out and hump her. It’s the only time she does it … sort of like she wants to share in the glory of the Frisbee being caught.” (Is this the canine equivalent of painting your face and watching theSuper Bowl?)\nCeleste Pongrácz, a Mudi breeder in Hungary, finds that mounting can change with hormonal shifts. “Right now, we live with seven bitches, and when somebody is coming into season or is in season, some dogs want to hump, and others ‘ask’ to be humped. Regardless, it always involves the bitch in season.” Studies find that neutering males can decrease mounting, but certainly does not stop it in its tracks. After all, there is more to it than hormones.\nFor some owners, dog mounting equates to dominance and control, words that suggest you might not want your four-legged friend engaging in this behavior. But what isdominance, and where does mounting fit in? The American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior defines it as “a relationship between individual animals that is established by force/aggression and submission, to determine who has priority access to multiple resources such as food, preferred resting spots and mates.”\nIs mounting associated with dominance? Not necessarily. Becky Trisko, PhD, behaviorist and owner of Unleashed in Evanston, Ill., studied interactions in the daycare setting. Mounting was not associated with status-related (“agonistic”) behaviors like aggression and submission, but instead was correlated with play and other affiliative behaviors. For example, a dog who muzzle-licks another dog — a behavior often associated with “Let’s be friends. Like me! Like me!” — might also mount the same dog. If mounting indicated status or a dominance relationship, we would expect mounters to receive submission from other dogs, but that’s not what we’re finding. Likewise, a pup is probably not trying to dominate the dog bed he just mounted.\nMore Motivations Behind Mounting\nNobel Prize–winner and famed ethologist Niko Tinbergen’s “four questions” shed some light on humping. One of Tinbergen’s questions is particularly apt: “How does a behavior develop during an individual’s lifetime?” After all, behaviors don’t simply fall from the sky, land on a dog and voilà! Mounting!\nMounting occurs in a variety of contexts and can be surrounded by many different behaviors. Humping could be an assertive behavior related to social bonds rather than competition for resources or status. Infriendlycontexts, canine mounting could be an attention-getting behavior to instigate an interaction. As Trisko explains, “Among preferred play partners it almost seems to be a way to get the other to play. A dog might do aplay bow, bark and paw at a dog. If the second dog isn’t really responding, mounting will often get a rise out of the dog, and then they’ll play.”\nTwo animal behavior experts agree it’s usuallyplay fighting. Here’s how you can tell.\nTrisko also suggests that mounting among friends is associated with bond-testing. “This is the idea that dogs perform potentially annoying behaviors like mounting to test the strength of the recipient’s investment in the relationship. It’s like saying, ‘How much will you put up with?’ ‘How much do you really like me?’” Since mounting seems to appear in affiliative, not aggressive or status-related contexts, this is a provocative possibility.\nAt the same time, mounting is not always related to friendship. Aimee Moore, CPDT, of Dog’s Best Friend Training in Madison, Wisc., says, “I don’t think there is one simple explanation, but with unfamiliar dogs, or often even with owners, it can be pretty rude and related to status.”\nAs Borchelt, who has treated behavior problems for more than 30 years, observes, “Mounting could be part of a suite of behaviors associated withaggression, such as high posture,resource guarding, direct stares, and threats and standing over. But mounting, by itself, doesn’t indicate a status issue. By itself, mounting might not mean a lot.” He also feels that it could even be problematic to ascribe the label of “dominance” to a dog who is a mounter. “If you perceive a dog as dominant because he mounts, you might think you have to take steps so that the dog isn’t dominant to you — maybe always make the dog heel, which could cut back on sniffing, exercise and dog-dog interactions, or use intimidation to make the dog follow explicit rules. This could have negative consequences for the relationship.”\nWhat Can You Do About Your Dog Humping?\nTraining and dog-owner communication can help a humper maintain friendly interactions with dogs and humans alike. Moore suggests various training techniques. “I would work on obedience so I could get my dog’s attention when she starts to focus on another dog. I would also work on call-aways —dog greetsand sniffs appropriately, then call her back and reinforce for that behavior. This way, you are catching her before she mounts.” Since mounting is often associated with arousal levels, Moore recommends relaxation protocols, down-stays, or teaching an alternative behavior. Angela Limburg of Chicago, Ill., tries redirecting her dog. “My boy humps his bedding. It seems to happen when he isoverexcited. We try to redirect him — usually, offering cheese or cookies works.”\nBut at the end of the day, mounting is still a tricky behavior to figure out. “Mounting is one of those behaviors you would not want to have a single answer for,” explains Borchelt, and ethologist Marc Bekoff, PhD, agrees. “It is complex, and we don’t want to say mounting is always this or always that. What we are learning about animal behavior is that we need to be very careful about generalities. Dogs don’t always greet each other by sniffing the anogenital region, and they don’t always circle before they lie down.”\nWhy relationships change in multi-dog households.\nIt is not uncommon for pet parents  to say, “I am deeplyembarrassed that my dog humps.” Some sense disapproval from other owners: “I feel a social imperative to stop his humping.” These feelings are understandable because, for many, dogs don’t just contribute hair to our favorite black pants; they are our family members and best friends. Which means that some of our best friends are humpers. “I think the sense of embarrassment is not well placed,” says Walsh. Given that mounting is a normal part of a dog’s behavioral repertoire, owners can eliminate some of the stress and anxiety by getting to know mounting as it pertains to their individual dog.\nBekoff recommends becoming an at-home ethologist. “Get a paper and pencil, and watch and record what happens before and after the behavior of interest. This can tell you more about the behavior itself.” This technique can help you determine when a behavior needs to be managed and when it’s just fine. So what’s your dog’s mounting behavior telling you? At the end of the day we’re better served by observation and understanding the root cause of the humping than being embarrassed by it.",

  },
  "page_content": "Have a four-legged Houdini on your hands? It’s less cute than it sounds — and sometimes scary. A dog who slips through an open door every chance they get is frustrating for you and dangerous for them. Exploring the fenced backyard? Fine. Sprinting down the middle of a busy street? Not so much.\nWhy would a well-loved pet with ample food, water, toys, and human attention choose to escape? Because it’s fun! The outside world can be endlessly reinforcing for a dog. If you have a dog who sniffs and investigates everything on walks, you know that from experience. The door-darter has also learned that dashing outside is a great way to get their couch-potato human to play with them — which further encourages their dramatic escapes. Plus, if you’ve ever reprimanded your dog when you finally got your hands on them, you’ve taught them that being captured makes bad stuff happen (hello, yelling) and the good stuff go away (bye-bye, playtime).\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nMaking good stuff go away is the definition of “negative punishment,” and making bad stuff happen is “positive punishment.” Your pup’s getting punished twice, and here’s the kicker: They won’t associate either punishment with their initial door-darting. Nope, they’ll instead connect both of those consequences with you catching them, which will make it even harder to retrieve them the next time they get loose. Here’s exactly what to do if your dog is a door-darter:\nGet them back.\nAnyone with a door-darter might say this is easier said than done. An accomplished door-darter is often an accomplished keep-away player as well. Don’t chase your dog; you’ll just be playing theirgame. Instead, try a different tack. Grab a squeaky toy, take it outside, and make it squeak. It may be counter-intuitive, but when your dog looks,run away from them, still squeaking the toy. If your dog chases you, let them grab one end of the toy. Play tug, trade the toy for a treat, then squeak and play some more. Let them follow you, playing tug, into your fenced yard, then close the gate (or into your garage or house if you don’t have a fence).\nKinshipCollective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a stubborn pup to listen up.\nOr, if your dog loves car rides, run to your car and say, “Wanna go for a ride?” Open the door, and when they jump in, follow through on your promise and take them for a cruise.Chasing tennis balls or flying discs? Fetching sticks? Walkies? Whatever gets their tail wagging with excitement, offer it.\nOnce you’ve corralled your wandering pup, the part about punishment bears repeating: No matter how upset you are,don’t yell.Don’t even reprimand them calmly. And don’t take your dog back inside immediately — that’s punishment, too. Stay outside and play a while. If you punish them or march them sternly back into the house, they’ll be harder to catch the next time. Instead, happily and genuinely reinforce their responding to you with whatever they love best.\nBlock their escape route.\nIf you can’t fence in your entire yard, perhaps you can fence a small area outside the door(s) or install a barrier outside, like a small area with a self-closing gate. A physical barrier is better than a shock fence, as determined dogs will run through those as easily as through open doors.\nBaby gates or exercise pens inside can block your dog’s access to escape. Insist that everyone — family and guests alike — makes sure the dog is behind the barrier before they go out the door or greet a visitor.\n6 puppy pens recommended by positive-reinforcement dog trainer Aislynn Ross, because we all need boundaries.\nPut your pup through their paces.\nIncreasing your dog’s level of aerobic exercise is another way to reduce the darting. If you keep your pup busy and tired, they’ll be less likely to look for opportunities to make a break for it.\nTrain them to wait at doors.\nTeach your dog to wait at doors until they’re given the release cue. With your dog sitting beside you at a door that opens outward, tell them to wait. Reach toward the doorknob. If they don’t move toward the door, click your clicker or use a verbal marker and give them a tasty treat. Repeat, moving your hand closer toward the doorknob in small increments, clicking and treating each time they remain seated.\nIf your dog gets up, say, “Oops!” have them sit, then try again. If they get up several times in a row, you’re asking too much of them; go back to moving your hand only a few inches toward the knob, and advance more slowly.\nWhen they stay sitting, touch the knob. Click/treat. Jiggle the knob. Click/treat. Repeat, clicking and treating each time, then open the door a crack. If your dog doesn’t move, click and treat. If they get up, say, “Oops!” and close the door. You’re teaching them that getting up closes the door; if they want the opportunity to go out, they must wait.\nUsing platforms are favorites with pro dog trainers—here’s why you should add them to your training to-do list.\nGradually open the door in one or two-inch increments. Any time they get up, say, “Oops” and start over. Do several repetitions at each step. When you can open the door all the way, take one step through, stop, turn around, and face your dog. Wait a few seconds, click, then return and treat.\nWhen your dog is solid with you walking through the door and doesn’t run out, occasionally invite them to go out ahead of, with or after you, by using a release cue such as “free.” Other times, walk through the door and close it, leaving them inside. Once the door closes, they’re free to get up and move around. You can give your release cue through the closed door, or simply leave them to figure out it’s okay once you’re gone. Theywillfigure it out.\nFinally, teach everyone who interacts with your dog how to ask for the “Wait” at the door. The more consistent everyone is at reinforcing this command, the more reliable your dog will be at waiting — and the less likely they’ll be to run out of the house. And that’s a winning combination.",

  "page_content": "Kane is a 22-month-old Cane Corso we brought home in March of 2020 as a puppy. He’s not aggressive, but he’s strong. When he wants in or out, he goes up to the door and hits it with his paw. Not only is it damaging the doors in the house, but he does it to people when he wants them to pet him as well. How can we get him to stop “pawing” at things? We call it his “bam bam” because he just hits anything like a bossy beast. —Jamie\nFirst of all, “bam bam” is adorable. Second, as always, one of the most important things to understand in this situation is your dog’s motivation. The reason he’s doing this is probably because he wanted something, he tried something — pawing — and he got access to something. In this case, I wouldn’t be surprised if it started with a door. He may have learned, “Hey, when I mash this door with my giant paw, it opens and I get to go outside.” Or, “If I start scratching the door, everybody freaks out that I’m scratching the door with my giant paw, and they open it for me.”\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nKeep the faith; you can fix this pee-action.\nIt’s hard to ignore a Cane Corso who is pawing at you for attention, but if you give them attention, they learn that their behavior is effective. And if you try to redirect with aboneortoy, they learn they’re actuallyrewardedfor bad behavior.\nUnderstanding Motivators and Consequences\nWe have to look at things from the dog’s perspective. All behavior has three parts. There’s the motivator, which is known as the antecedent. What does the dog want? What is he trying to gain access to or avoid? The second part is the behavior. What does it look like? How often does it happen? How severe is it? And the third part is what the consequence is from the animal’s perspective.\nWhen he paws you, the motivator is attention, the behavior is pawing at you, and the consequence is attention. If the motivation is to go outside, the behavior is pawing the door, and the consequence is the door opening. In both cases, the behavior is reinforced and locked in place. We need the consequence of Kane’s actions to not match his motivator, otherwise there’s no reason for him to stop pawing.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for calming down a dog who’s protective of their turf.\nBefore we can do any of this, we have to be sure that his needs are met. If he really needs to pee, and we’re not paying attention to him, scratching the door makes plenty of sense. So, we have to make sure that his schedule is set and his needs are fulfilled. Then, if it seems like he just can’t seem to stop the door scratching, you can block him from it or come up with other creative ways to prevent him from being able to engage in the behavior.\nRe-Teaching the Consequence\nYour best bet is to be proactive here and teach him how to get what he wants. If he’s pawing at you, you can get up and leave. If you come back and he paws again, continue to get up and leave until he stops — then, when you return, and he doesn’t paw, give him all the attention and loving in the world. If he’s pawing at the door, you can potentially give him a time-out there as well, removing his access from the door and then bringing him back to the door with you — maybe even on a leash. Then have him sit or lay down before opening the door for him. This way, he’ll learn that pawing at the door gets him the opposite of the door, but sitting at the door gets the door to open.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for dealing with an attention-seeking puppy.\nChanging the consequence of pawing without adding something scary or painful is important. We want to make sure that, instead of becoming fearful of certain behaviors, he learns a new skill that gives him access to the outside world.\nFor a while, you may want to require things like sitting, laying down — or eventricks like “handshake”— before giving him anything he wants, like food or access to furniture. All good things should be filtered through you — not because you’re thedominant alpha dog, but because you are his teacher and his guide. You have to show him as you guide him: This is how he can gain access to the things he wants in a calm, focused, non-demanding way.",

  "page_content": "If it’s not one thing, it’s your mother (a joke your therapist might have told you). So much about the way children respond to a variety of situations and challenges is predictable based on the parenting styles in which they are being raised, and new research finds a similar pattern with dogs. In astudyof 48 dogs and their people, published in the journalAnimal Cognition, researchers asked if pet-parenting style affected the way dogs perform in various tasks. Spoiler alert: It sure does!\nResearchers Lauren Brubaker and Monique Udell found that, just as with children, the home life of dogs plays a big role in who they become, how they act, and how they perform when faced with challenges. Udell says, “Dog owners who take the time to understand and meet their dog’s needs are more likely to end up with secure, resilient dogs.”\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nThe Study\nIn the study, pet parents took surveys that were used to classify them into three different pet parenting styles that closely match those of human-parenting styles. Their dogs then participated in three experiments so researchers could access the security of their attachment, their sociability, and their problem-solving skills.\nAnd by kids, I mean pets.\nThe first test assessed the level of attachment the dog has toward their person. To begin, they were in a room together, and the person interacted with their dog if they came close. Then the person left the room briefly before returning and reuniting with their dog. The second test investigated the dog’s social behavior. The dog’s interactions with their person as well as with a stranger were assessed. The third test evaluated each dog’s problem-solving ability by offering them the chance to figure out how to open a puzzle box to get the high-quality food inside.\nAuthoritative Parenting Style\nAuthoritative pet parents are those who have high expectations of their dogs and who are highly responsive to their dogs’ needs and behavior. In this study,  dogs with authoritative parents were generally more secure, more social, and better problem solvers. They were the dogs most likely to have secure attachment styles. They were the most responsive to social cues, chose to be near their people more than they chose to be close to strangers, and showed the highest rates of persistence when trying to solve the puzzle. They were especially focused on the puzzle box when their people offered them encouragement. Only dogs who were being raised by people with this parenting style were successfully able to solve the puzzle and reach the food within the puzzle box.\nAuthoritarian Parenting Style\nAuthoritarian pet parents have high expectations of their dogs but low levels of responsiveness to their dogs’ behavior and their needs. Dogs with this type of pet parent were more likely to be insecurely attached to their people relative to the dogs whose pet parents were authoritative. (The name is similar, but the pet parenting style is quite different!) They also spent more time in the company of their pet parents than the company of strangers. None of these dogs successfully solved the puzzle-box task.\nHow the“love hormone”oxytocinconnects us with our pups.\nPermissive Parenting Style\nPermissive pet parents are people who have low expectations and low levels of responsiveness to what their dogs need and to what they do. Dogs with this type of parent were more responsive to social cues of strangers than to their own people. They spent an equal amount of time near their parents when they were being attentive to their dog as when they were ignoring their dog. These dogs were not persistent when trying to solve the puzzle-box task and had no success at it.\nThe finding that pet-parenting style affects attachment style, sociability, and problem-solving skills matches what we already know from studies of human children. With the increased convergence of caretaking behavior toward kids and toward dogs, it’s little wonder the same parenting styles lead to the same patterns in both species. According to Brubaker, “This research shows that the pet dog-human caretaker bond may be functionally and emotionally similar to the bond between a human parent and their child.”",

  "page_content": "Jack is a super good boy. The only problem is Jack and his sister Callie are fence fighters. They bark at everyone who goes by, including children, moms with strollers…god forbid they have a dog with them. Jack appears especially scary, throwing himself against the fence. Being part Pittie, he can’t afford any trouble. How do I get Jack to stop being overly protective of his turf and lunging at the fence? — Adria\nJack sounds amazing, and it’s great that he’s found such an understanding family. It sounds like Jack is very protective; he’s probably anxious when outsiders approach, because he sees them as potential intruders. It’s a loving instinct, but as you’ve seen, it can come across as “scary” — and you’re right that, unfortunately, aggressive behavior isjudged especially harshly in Pit Bulls.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nIt can take a long time to train a dog to beless protective, because what you’re really trying to do is calm them, which means changing their emotional reactions. It’ll take a lot of patience and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution, but don’t lose hope — there are ways to relax a fence-attacking dog.\nFirst of all, you need to keep Jack out of the yard until the problem is resolved. Every time he practices leaping at the fence, he gets better at doing it. Right now, Jack potentially sees people as a threat, which is why he’s lunging and barking. He may be trying to discourage the people passing by from entering your property. What’s tricky is that when he barks and lunges and then people continue walking by, he may be seeing this as a cause-and-effect situation; this means every time he barks and someone doesn’t enter, it reinforces his belief that he must bark, because he’s doing a good job protecting his yard.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for dealing with a protective dog that’s taken their duties too far.\nIf there’s any way to block the area from him, he’ll have less of a chance to reinforce the habit. I don’t know Jack well enough to give you exact parameters, but you should find other ways for him to get out and urinate without guarding the fence. If that means you can build a separate section away from that side of the yard, that’s great. If it means he may have to do his business on a leash or on walks for now, that’s another option. But if he’s out in the yard tomorrow doing this, he’s only getting better at it.\nHow to Get Your Dog to Relax\nNext, you should engage in a relaxation protocol. I recommend theKaren Overall Relaxation Protocol.What this does is teach your dog to stay still while more intense things are happening around them. That can start in the house with both dogs; you may have to start one at a time, depending on where they each are in their training. If you can get them to stay while taking, let’s say, three steps back, that might be your day one training.\nThe next day, you have them stay while you clap your hands, then while you turn your back, then while you go to another room — basically, you’re building up to more and more exciting, distracting things happening in their environment. Eventually, you want them to be able to stay still while you open the front door, ring the doorbell, or sit on the ground.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for turning a stressful walk into a chill stroll.\nYou would then take those skills out into the yard with them on their leashes, probably one dog at a time, and train them to sit and stay calm while people are passing. It’s important that you reward them for staying calm when people pass. We need to change your dog’s emotional association to people passing by. That means giving lots oftreatsand pets — or whatever their favorite thing is — whenever they exhibit good behavior.\nAgain, this could be a long road. Avoid using things that promise to be quick fixes. Using force or something that creates pain, like aninvisible fenceorshock collar, can give you a short term change, but the emotional association toward the trigger is likely going to get worse. Jack will just become more concerned about — and afraid of — people passing by, because he’ll associate them with punishment. Instead, use high-value reinforcement for staying calm in the presence of the trigger. This process will take time and patience, but it’s absolutely possible to change Jack’s relationship with the backyard fence.",

  "page_content": "Charley, a rescued three-year-old Lab who’d spent his entire life in an outdoor kennel, was scared of everything when we first got him. He’s been with us for eight months, and now, he panics when we leave him alone. We have two crates, one in our house and one in our car. He goes into the home crate and stays there for about an hour. I’ve been gradually closing the door and even leaving the house, and when I come back, he’s fine. However, when we put him in his car crate, he just loses it, so distraught that he’s destroyed a crate bed and a quilt. Is this separation anxiety? We adore him and want to help him, but what can we do?\nCharley is obviously suffering from a form ofseparation distress, which is not uncommon for a dog who has spent so much of his life in relative isolation. Fear of abandonment and the desire to seek reattachment are what drive some dogs into a panic when left alone, and the resulting destructive behavior is a manifestation of this desperate feeling.Extensive research has shown that dogs suffer from the same kinds offears, phobias, and anxieties as do humans, even experiencing the canine equivalent of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). It would not surprise me if your dog were suffering from a version of PTSD, which could be triggered by being inconfined places, even in a car that he knows. Dogs who become distressed when left alone typically do not do well in confined spaces such ascrates, and in Charley’s case, it’s evident that his anxiety is a result of his previous confinement.You seem to have made good progress desensitizing your pup to the crate in your home, and a similar routine needs to be adopted for the crate in your car. Until he is completely comfortable being in the car, it’s better for him to stay at home, where he feels secure. If you try taking him in the car too early in the process, he will revert to his former behavior, so be sure to work slowly. Here is a step-by-step guide to help a dog scared of cars become accustomed to their crate.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nHow to treat and prevent confinement anxiety.\nCrate Training for Dogs Scared of Car Rides\nTo begin with, show your dog that being in the car is a good thing. At various times during the day, walk him to where your car is parked and either feed him his favorite food in the car or play his favorite game around it.\nAs your dog becomes accustomed to hanging around the car, open the doors and sit next to your pup while he is in his crate, with the crate door open so he can leave if he wants. Allowing him the freedom to make choices will help increase his confidence.\nGive him a durable rubber toy, like afrozen kong, stuffed with food to chew when he’s in the crate. If, however, he decides to leave, gently take the toy from your dog and place it in the crate again, showing him that’s where he gets the nice stuff.\nWhat to do when your dog barks at everything from other cars to people.\nOnly when you see that your dog is eager to be in the car crate with the door open should you start closing the door for short periods while you sit with him. Gradually increase the length of time the door is closed.\nAt this point, you can begin moving away from the car for a minute or two while your pup is chewing on his toy, returning frequently to praise him for calm behavior. As long as your dog is showing no signs of anxiety, you can spend more time away from the car. Repeat this training in different environments until he’s completely comfortable.\nOnce your dog is comfortable in the crate while you drive, take him to a variety of places and repeat the exercise, which will help him learn that being in the car with you in different environments is a good thing.\nIf your pup doesn’t respond to desensitization, you may have to get rid of the crate altogether and use acanine seatbelt harnessinstead, which will keep them safe while allowing them a little more freedom. This in itself may be the only change you need to make for them to feel more secure when they are in the car.\nHitting the road with your dog? Make sure they're safe with this helpful advice.\nA Word of Caution on Leaving Dogs in Cars\nIt goes without saying that a dog should never be left in a hot car. But did you know that it is dangerous to leave them in the car when the weather’s warm (or very cold) too? In direct sunlight, a car can heat up within minutes, even on relatively cool days. A recentstudyfound that 39% of participants were unaware of the ideal temperature in a car for a dog, and almost 16% didn’t know the signs ofheat stroke. Never leave your dog alone in a car with the outside temperatures above 70 degrees outside. Leave your dog at home if you know you will be running errands or going to dinner.",

How do I get her to stop?— Vanessa\nThis is a common problem, and it usually comes down to understimulation. Your dog probably wants to play! A bite at your ankles is most likely an attempt to get you to react and respond, which is a little more fun than her toys.

Just like with little kids, they’ll learn that attention is attention — even negative attention seems worth it.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s pro tips for getting a hyped-up dog to chill out.\nYou need to make sure that her physicalandmental needs are met. She should know basic commands, such as “come,” “sit,” “stay,” and“down.” You don’t have to carve out a huge amount of time to train, but you can work it into your regular schedule and train for five minutes here and there. I usually recommend training around mealtime; the dog is really motivated by hunger, and you’re spending time with the dog anyway.\nThe environmental enrichment piece has to do with how the environment plays back with the dog. A lot of times we have toys scattered all over the floor, and dogs get bored with those. You want to make sure that your dog has interactive toys. They might be part of a dog’s meal; I think puppies should have a good bit of their meal be fed out of food dispensing toys, such asKongs,lick mats, andtreat balls. Some things will accept dry food and some will accept wet food. It’ll make a huge difference. Your dog is gonna spend maybe 40 minutes eating breakfast, using their mouth and mind. The likelihood of them needing to nip at you goes down considerably.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s pro tips for walking a pup that wantsto chase everything that moves.\nIf they’re still nipping then, it’s fair to give them a timeout — but it’s not fair to give them a timeout if their needs aren’t being met elsewhere. You can put them in a separate space from you or remove yourself from them. Losing access to you and access to a social space is the punishment. I think this is usually an appropriate punishment: It doesn’t add fear or intimidation — it just removes something the dog wants. If you teach your dog that biting your ankles unplugs the DJ and shuts down the party, so to speak, they should start selecting against the behavior of nipping.\nAfter a while, they’ll learn that it’s counterproductive to nip at you. Keep in mind that timeouts can’t be your only solution. You have to make sure their physical, mental, and environmental needs are all being met first.",

  "page_content": "As a dog behaviorist, I often get asked, “Is what my dog doing normal?” Top topics that pop up regularly are: rolling in garbage or poop,eating poop,chasing their tail,chewing their paws,humping,crotch-sniffing, and, well, the list goes on.\nThe answer to most of these? “Yes, they are all perfectly normal behaviors” — they’re just not activities that we humans are familiar with or particularly comfortable with. Sometimes, I’m asked if it’s normal for a dog to stop short and freeze completely while on a walk, like your neighborhood’s newest statue. The answer depends on the severity of the situation. Here’s everything you need to know.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nHow Do Dogs React to Fear?\nIf your dog freezes multiple times during a walk, that can be pretty distressing — for both you and your dog. There can be many reasons for freezing. To modify the behavior, you need to understand the underlying issue, which ismost likely fear. Dogs tend to react in four ways when they feel uneasy. Commonly referred to as the Four Fs of Fear by dog experts, these include:\nFight\nFight\nFlight\nFlight\nFreeze\nFreeze\nFooling around\nFooling around\nAlmost everyone has heard of the fight or flight response — the tendency to either stand and confront the source of your fear (fight) or to run from it (flight). Both of these reactions can be observed regularly by humans and animals alike.\nThere’s nothing to fear but fear itself — and a dog who won’t stop shaking when it thunders.\nThe two lesser-known reactions are to freeze or fool around. Fooling around is a displacement behavior. It is a behavior that is inappropriate to the situation but diffuses the tension and relieves stress. If a dog is presented with an object or person they have not seen before, they may dance around, hot-stepping or barking at the unknown and somewhat scary new thing.\nWhy do dogs freeze?\nFreezing is exactly as it sounds. Your dog will freeze, relying on stillness to go undetected, like a deer in headlights. Dogs commonly exhibit freezing when reacting to stress or fear. Once they’re still, they assess the situation and then decide what to do next. Is it safe to move on or could the danger still be in the area? If they continue to feel under threat, theymay refuse to walkon.\nDogs have extremely sensitive noses, amazing hearing, and an incredible line of vision. They may smell, hear, or see something that you’re not aware of. Maybe they can hear the neighborhood bully dog in the distance, smell the treat lady’s biscuits, or see kids in hoodies that remind them of past trauma.\nPro tips for boosting the confidence of a scaredy-cat dog.\nInterestingly, dogs can freeze without you even noticing. The freeze, assessment, and decision to continue is so rapid that the dog has moved on before the freeze is noted. This assessment will include the dog’s current circumstances, their well-being, and who they are with. The confidence that a dog has in their human is similar to that of a child with a parent. Dogs who wholeheartedly trust their human and their ability to defend are far less likely to freeze while in their presence.\nIf your dog is showing signs of severe fearfulness, I suggestcontacting a canine behaviorist and dog trainerto understand the triggers and work on building your dog’s confidence. Telltale signs of severe fearfulness include:tail between legs, shaking, flitting from one spot to another, and distress peeing.\nOther Freezing Triggers\nAnother common cause of freezing could be learned behavior. For example, if you try to get your dog to walk bygiving them a treat, your dog will start to think freezing results in a treat and will repeat the behavior. Stop rewarding the behavior and they’ll stop freezing.\nNot all fearful dogs have been mistreated.\nOf course, there could be other reasons your dog is freezing on walks. Maybe they’re tired and want to go home, they’re thirsty and want a drink, their feet are aching, or they’re stubborn and want towalk a different route. They may remember the bread that was left out for the birds at the house two streets up and hope it will be there again today.\nHow to Prevent Your Dog From Freezing on Walks\nBuilding confidence is the best solution. It could be that your dog needs to feel more confident with you. Or, it could be that they need to feel more confident when outside. Or, it could be a combination of the two. Building confidence will reduce freezing and encourage your dog to continue to walk — but this can be a long game, depending on how deep-rooted the fear is.\nMake a diary of your walks to find patterns in your dog’s freezing. Is there a certain route they do not like? Are there certain noises that trigger them? Does daytime or nighttime produce more freezing? Do they freeze more with one member of the family than another?\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nGathering this information means you can start to create a walk that avoids the triggers. Why stress your dog out unnecessarily? Building confidence occurs much more quickly if a dog is not already stressed and anticipating fear before they have even left the house.\nDo not force your dog to walk in a direction that they’re scared to go in. You will gain more trust by taking a different route than forcing them to walk on. You might need to only cross the street but to your dog, you are addressing their discomfort and taking control of the situation. As trust builds in you and freezing subsides, you can start to tackle the source of the fear.\nThe bottom line: Dogs live in the moment. If a dog freezes, they’re doing so for a reason. Work with your dog to understand that reason and then address it. Walks are supposed to be enjoyable for both you and your dog. After all, they’re an enjoyable way for you both to exercise, socialize, and bond.",

You also probably got used to wiping up pee so often that you didn’t even bother putting thecleaning suppliesback in the cabinet. This especially happened when your friends would come over and lean down to pet your puppy, which triggers the waterworks.\nIf your dog pees when they are being approached by people or dogs, when they are being greeted and pet, or when they hear loud noises while displaying submissive postures (such as cowering, tucking their tail between their legs,flattening their ears, or rolling), you are probably dealing with submissive urination — and you’re not alone.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for helping an adult dog learn to go outside in a new environment.\nSubmissive urination is a common and normal problem among puppies. Some dogs who are otherwise completely housetrained release at least some urine during greetings. Contrary to popular belief, submissive urination is not ahousetrainingproblem. It’s a social issue.\nWhen Puppies Pee On The Floor It's Normal\nIf you have a puppy who pees when you pet them, know that most dogs outgrow this behavior by the time they are a year old. Also, dogs with this issue almost always have lovely, sweet temperaments. So, while the urination can be irritating and a pain to clean up, the fact that dogs greet people or other dogs in this manner actually speaks well of them.\nIronically, when a dog urinates during greetings, they are showing respect for the other dog or person.\nWhat to Do About Submissive Urination In Older Dogs\nI recently consulted with a family whose sweet, three-year-old Newfoundland was urinating inside the home. Because their veterinarian could find no medical reason for it, she referred them to me to handle the “housetraining” problem. To many people, house-soiling without a medical cause is always related to housetraining, but behaviorists recognize that many issues involving urination indoors can be signs of appeasement behavior or a need to mark territory, among other possibilities.\nWhat to do when your dog has questionable tastes.\nInitially, it was challenging to get contextual information from the family about the problem because they just kept saying, “He pees everywhere, and it’s such a mess!” Then, they would detail the clean-up, which was no doubt considerable given that the dog weighed 125 pounds. With persistent inquiry, however, I was finally able to get a fuller picture; it turned out that the dog’s issue was not a housetraining problem.\nThe dog’s housetraining was solid, but they peed during greetings. As a puppy, they urinated whenever they greeted anyone. But now, they only did it when greeting the husband or the occasional male visitor, especially if the visitor reached for the dog.\nRecognizing that the inappropriate urination was a specific type of social issue rather than one of bladder control — or not knowing or caring where it was appropriate to pee —  made it easier to address the real issue: the husband’s approach to his sensitive dog. He thought he was doing right by his dog by being firm and applying stern, consistent discipline, but he was open to a new approach.\nI was able to help the family by teaching the husband kinder, gentler and more effective ways to interact with his dog and influence the dog’s behavior. As a result, the dog stopped having accidents in the house. No program designed to solve a housetraining problem would have achieved this result, which had the added benefit of improving the overall family dynamic as well.\nIn short, keep the faith — and keep the cleanup spray handy.",

Ifthe billis passed, it would mean a $500 fine for anyone caught selling the controversial punishment device which, as Rosenthal says, “can result in burns to the skin and cause stress and anxiety to dogs, resulting in aggression or other behaviors.”\nAs Rosenthal notes in hermemorandum: “Many countries, including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Germany have already implemented bans on shock collars.” This bill would make New York the first state in the country to adopt a similar ban. Between this proposal andthe recent ban of puppy mills, New Yorkers might be witnessing a sea change in the legal protection of animal rights.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nExperts pick the best harnesses for every kind of dog—from flat-faced breeds to tiny teacups to escape artists.\nWhy Ban Shock Collars?\nMost dog trainers, includingeach one Kinship works with, prefer positive reinforcement methods. This means they use rewards to encourage dogs to repeat good behaviors — as opposed to positive-punishment training, which inflicts an unpleasant stimulus (such as a shock or a yell) in order to discourage bad behaviors. As Melissa Dallier, a certified professional dog trainer,wrote for, “Science and experience over the years have made it clear that ‘positive reinforcement’ or “reward-based” training is the most effective and humane way to train dogs.”\nGenerally, punishment training comes with more risks. According to Dallier, shock collars and other negative tools, such aselectric fencesand prong collars, “often only suppress undesirable behaviors and have been proven to cause additional behavior problems like fearfulness, aggression, and learned helplessness.”\nMost commonly, dogs can be taught to fear — rather than respect — their trainer or anything associated with training. What happens if you use a shock collar on a loud dog while they’re on a walk? Instead of a quiet dog, you might end up with a pup who’s terrified of their leash and refuses to go outside with you. Aggressive behavior is another logical response to pain. Instead of seeing you as a teacher, the dog in question will learn to see you as an enemy.\nDallier’s final example, “learned helplessness,” occurs when dogs experience so much punishment that they don’t feel that they have control over their outcomes and behaviors, so they shut down completely.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nDr. Marty Becker, the founder of Fear Free Pets, a“science-based organization” based on over 300 studies, agrees with Dallier. He lists the use of shock collars as a red flag to look out for in trainers, citingDr. Karen Overall’sassertion that “Fear is the worst thing a social species can experience, and it causes permanent damage to the brain.”\nPositive-reinforcement trainers are much more in favor of reward over punishment of any kind. As Dr. Becker toldKinship, “Part of our slogan is to put the treat into treatment. You show [a pet] what you want them to do and then reward them when they do it, or get close to doing it. Fear Free always works to reduce or remove triggers that cause fear, anxiety, and stress.”\nIn other words, it takes time for a pup to truly understand what behaviors you want from them. Instead of learning which behaviors are unacceptable, they should be encouraged to continue good behavior withtreats, pets, and lots of patience.\nDisclaimer:We understand that some pet parents use shock collars on the vibrate setting to communicate with their deaf dogs. This article is not suggesting it is wrong to use this tool in that manner to make life more accessible for your dog.",

  "page_content": "Legal work has gained a lot of publicity in recent years, thanks to one hell of a run on television.The Good Wifeproved it can be sexy,Better Call Saulshowed its darkly comedic side, andHow To Get Away With Murderhighlighted how easily it can be manipulated. Of course,Law & OrderOGs have long known all three to be true (thank you, Dick Wolf), but that’s not the point.\nWhat is worth noting, though, is that all these depictions miss one major hole in the current system: dog law. Historically, when a dog has been involved in an altercation or violent incident, they have been treated less than fairly. But one dedicated lawyer is actively working to correct this unfortunate trend.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nAlong with his wife, Robin Mittasch, Richard Rosenthal startedthe Lexus Project, a nonprofit that provides legal representation for dogs ordered to be euthanized. He explains toKinshipthat when it comes to dogs, determining innocence and fault is rarely as clear-cut as it is for humans.\nAn Unexpected Career\n“Most of the time, dangerous dog law is not about the question of ‘Did the dog do it?.’ Instead, it’s focused on what caused the incident and who is responsible,” says Rosenthal. He uses an example of two dogs getting into a tussle. If a person interferes and is bitten, the case becomes more complex than one involving a single animal.\nThe same is true for dog-on-dog cases. According to Rosenthal,  if two dogs get into a scuffle and one of them is small, such as a Chihuahua, the significantly bigger dog in the fight, such as a Pit Bull, will be found at fault.\nBeware of dogs who are silent, stealthy aggressors.\n“Nine out of 10 times, they will bring dangerous dog charges against the larger dog despite the fact that from the dog’s point of view, they were protecting themselves. Often, the smaller dog attacks them, and they just fight back,” he says.\nContrary to his passion and principled efforts, Rosenthal never planned to end up working in this field of law — let alone revolutionize it. For 30 years, he operated primarily in family and criminal law with his own practice.\nOne Case Changed It All\nBut that all changed with one case 15 years ago. As long-time lovers of the breed, Rosenthal and Mittasch came across a terrible story posted to a Greyhound message board. A Greyhound, Lexus, who was about a week retired from racing, was taken to a park in Rhode Island. While there, an owner of a six-month-old Pomeranian thought it would be cute to let their puppy run with the big dogs.\n“You have to understand that, to Greyhounds, they don’t think they’re racing when they’re running — they’re hunting. And when you put a small furry rodent on the ground in front of them running, they have a name for it. It’s called prey,” tells Rosenthal. Sadly, the Greyhound reacted precisely in that fashion and snatched the puppy in their mouth, ultimately killing the Pomeranian.\nKeep you and your dog safe in case of a dog fight emergency.\nInitially, the court was willing to let Lexus live if her owner built a cement bunker in his backyard and kept her in there for the rest of her life, except to go to the vet. He refused for numerous reasons, including cost, so Lexus was scheduled to be put down. Despite not being based in Rhode Island and having no experience with animal law, Rosenthal put together a defense and was able to save the dog — even if the court permitted it with a snarl.\n“I got my first get out-of-town-by-sundown order, which read that I, as an officer of the court, were to travel to Rhode Island, take possession of the dog from animal control, and remove her from the state by the most direct route without stopping — never to return,” he remembers. “I assumed the last part referred only to the dog, but I’m not 100 percent sure.”\nThe Work Continues\nRosenthal now practices animal law full time because, in his words, “The more we did it, the more we realized how underserved this issue was.” However, much of the response to his work remains ominous.\n“The people who are anti-Pit Bull hate me,” he says before detailing how he routinely receives hate mail — and occasionally death threats. But none of that has deferred Rosenthal from defending dogs who need help. In fact, he takes upwards of 30 cases a year operating out of his offices on Long Island and often saves animals from being put down.\nUnfortunately, some of the system’s most detrimental players are those who are meant to protect it. According to Rosenthal, it’s fairly common for police to shoot dogs when called in for incidents — and it’s generally unjustified and unnecessary. “For the most part, what you see in those cases is people who piss themselves at the mere sight of a dog. And giving them a gun and the freedom to shoot is not the most brilliant move,” he says.\nBreed-specific legislation has profound impacts on families, their dogs, and animal welfare professionals.\nRosenthal adds that it’s similarly typical in these situations for a cop to report the dog as a Pit Bull and state that they are afraid for their life, regardless of the dog’s actual breed. This may not be surprising to anyone who’s been following Pit Bulls’ treatment and themisinterpretationof their breed, but it’s disappointing nonetheless.\nThat’s not to say Rosenthal’s efforts have gone entirely unnoticed or unappreciated. He’s received plenty of encouraging press coverage and has helped inspire newfound interest in animal law and the desire to manage it justly. Rosenthal tells me he’s even been pitched reality shows covering his caseload — which he’s declined. “I don’t see that format as advancing what I do,” he responds.\nSo, what should we — and hopefully, the courts — take away from his work? In short, as Rosenthal says, “Essentially, animal law should require the same nuance as human law.”",

  "page_content": "As much as your high school superlative — “most likely to pull an epic prank” — isn’t meant to follow you around, labels tend to stick. While you might not be a 30-year-old placing whoopee cushions around the conference room at work, people might still expect you to be the one to crack up the room at a dull meeting that could have been an email. You’re the “fun one,” but it does not define who you are.\nThe same thing goes for your pup as soon as you decide whotheyare. When it comes to dogs, labeling often does more harm than good, especially when that label is wrong.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nThe Pros of Labeling Dog Behavior\nIt’s not surprising that we want to label dogs’ behavior issues: It matches the system we use for people. In the realm of human health care, labels are necessary, because billing codes are required for insurance coverage of both treatment and medications.\nHaving a label for a dog’s behavior problem may also make it easier for us to access information and resources. Learning that our dogs have a known syndrome or problem often makes pet parents feel better even before there’s any discussion about what to do to improve the behavior. It’s a natural human tendency; just naming a problem can give us a sense of control over it.\n“America’s Veterinarian” and the founder of Fear Free Pets, Dr. Marty Becker, on how this method makes vet visits, training sessions, and grooming appointments less stressful for pets.\nMaybe the biggest advantage to labeling behavior problems is that it provides a verbal shorthand that speeds up communication. There’s an appealing simplicity to using a short phrase or two to identify a dog’s issue rather than going into great detail about each incident.\nThe Cons of Labeling Dog Behavior\nOn the other hand, describing the behavior in detail lends an accuracy to the situation that labels sometime obscure. Indeed, labeling dog behavior can often lead tomislabeling, which interferes with arriving at an appropriate response to the problem, whatever the problem turns out to be.\nFor example, every year, multiple clients seek my help withseparation anxietybecause they have been told (erroneously) that their dog suffers from it.\nWhen the real issue is boredom, incompletehouse training, or a simple (which is not to say easy!)case of adolescence, changing the undesirable behavior by approaching it as a case of separation anxiety is unlikely to be successful. Instead ofmedicationand complex protocols to change behavior, the real solution could be adding activities andenrichmentopportunities, returning to house training 101, or providing a long exercise session before putting the dog in acratewith appropriate, long lastingchewables.\nIt is also common for people to be concerned because their dog is “protective” of them. Lila brought Banjo to me because every time anyone got near Lila, Banjo barked, growled, and lunged. Lila was concerned that he would hurt someone, but delighted by his bold confidence. Trouble was, after taking a case history and observing Banjo in a variety of contexts, I could tell that he was not protecting her so much as he was possessing her.\nIf your dog growls when you get near their food or toys, read thisright now.\nHe guarded toys, food, sleeping spaces, and anything he considered of value, including Lila. He was not her brave protector, but an insecure dog who considered her to be the best bone in the world, and he was not going to let someone else have her. Mislabeling Banjo’s behavior as “protectiveness” rather than of “possessiveness” hindered attempts to change this behavior and interfered with Lila’s understanding of who Banjo was.\nAnother problem with labeling behavior problems is that it oversimplifies the situation. If a dog is called a “fear biter” or even labeled with the more professional sounding “fear-based aggression,” it implies a simplicity that is just not there.\nA related drawback of labeling behavior problems is that the label seems to require a simple solution. Boxed-in thinking about how to change undesirable behavior can short-circuit continued investigation. For example, using the label “arousal-based aggression” gives the impression that all that is needed is an appropriate behavior modification program. But that label may mask the dog’s anxiety and the need for intervention to address it.\n(Mis)labeling Dog Behavior May Lead to Unnecessary Shame\nThere’s also the issue of shame; giving a dog’s problem a label makes it seem more serious and alarming to pet parents and may make them feel unnecessarily ashamed of their dog’s behavior. That’s especially true of any label that includes the word “aggressive,” which carries a stigma.\nPeople are often devastated to be told that their dog is aggressive, especially if the dog is sweet and loving within the family. It can be even harder for a family whose dog is behaving out of characterbecause of an injury. If the dog is in such pain that the problem behavior is just the dog’s attempt to keep people from touching them, I would rather say that than call the dog “aggressive.”\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nIf people understand that dogs are barking, growling, or biting because they are desperate to increase the distance between themselves and whatever scares them (i.e., other dogs, people, trash cans, bicycles) and will only stop if we can help them overcome their fears, there’s less judgment and more hope. Focusing on the behavior itself — what the dog does— and discussing the motivation behind it avoids problems that can come up with simply labeling the behavior.\n(Mis)Labeling Dog Behavior\nI recently consulted with a family whose dog was a victim of a labeling error that made it impossible for them to help him. This family’s sweet, three-year-old Newfoundland was peeing inside the home and because their veterinarian could find no medical reason for it, she had referred them to me handle the “house training” problem. One complication with this particular label is that there is no agreement across disciplines about what it means. To many people, accidents without a medical cause are always related to house training. But behaviorists recognize that urination indoors can be signs of appeasement behavior or a need to mark territory, among other possibilities.\nIt was a challenge to get contextual information from the family about the problem because they just kept saying, “He pees everywhere, and it’s such a mess!” I was finally able to get a more complex picture; it turned out not to be a house training problem after all. The dog’s house training was solid, but he peed during greetings. As a puppy, he urinated whenever he greeted anyone, but now he only did it when greeting the husband or the occasional male visitor, especially if the visitor reached for the dog.\nHow to re-housetrain a dog of any age.\nRecognizing that the inappropriate urination was a specific type of social issue (often called “submissive urination” and somewhat unusual in dogs older than 12 to 18 months of age) rather than one of bladder control made it easier to address the real issue: the husband’s approach to his sensitive dog.\nI was able to help the family by teaching the husband kinder, gentler, and more effective ways to interact with his dog and influence the dog’s behavior. As a result, the dog stopped doing his business in the house.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe temptation to put a name on a problem is strong, and many of us are quick to embrace it. While labeling seems like an intuitively obvious approach, the downsides are too important and too numerous for me to be on board with it. Labels can turn dogs into a stereotype, rather than what they actually are: individuals that shouldn’t be judged by one label. Just like their parents.",

  "page_content": "Peach is a four-year-old Pomeranian / mini Poodle mix. He had an excellent start to life. Ever since my spouse, Peach, and I moved from our 600 square-foot city apartment into a 2,000+ square foot suburban home we share with another couple and dog, our pup has decided that every room is the bathroom. He pees and poops everywhere. We’ve tried giving him more built-in potty times, but he no longer requests to go outside; he just finds a secret spot. We’ve tried potty bells (he’s afraid) and keeping doors shut, but I think the environment is just so different.\nWow — congrats on the big move. Moving is stressful for humans and dogs alike. You’re right that environment is a factor in Peach’s behavior. His routine is off; there’s more space. He doesn’t yet understand the ritual of going to the bathroom in your new home. He might be confused if he’s used to going to the bathroom on the cement, and suddenly we’re asking him to go on a big grass yard. The same goes for if he went on a leash and now he’s free to roam. There are several ways we can help Peach adjust to his new surroundings.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nKeep the conditions as similar as possible.\nIf he’s used to urinating and defecating on cement, bring him out to the cement. If he would go on walks, take him for a walk. Sometimes when we go from the city to the suburbs, we put a dog out on the yard and the dog just doesn’t get it — they have no way of knowing that’s their new going-out routine.\nTips you’ll want to pay attention to.\nDon’t punish accidents.\nRight now, going to the bathroom is self-rewarding for Peach. If he poops behind the couch and no one sees it, he’s fine with that; it feels good, and it was successful. Even if you see him an hour later and tell him “no,” he doesn’t know what you’re talking about. And if you catch a dog in the act and get really mad, they’ll just assume you have a weird hang-up about urine, and then they’ll try to hold it when you’re around — which is a problem when you’re trying to get them to go outside.\nBringing a dog back to their own urine and rubbing their face in it just freaks them out, I promise. They aren’t learning from that experience. So even though it’s frustrating, if he goes inside, chalk it up to confusion. Don’t get angry with him.\nCelebrity dog trainerVictoria Stilwell on how to keep your dog from using your living room as a toilet.\nPut your dog’s food on a schedule.\nIn order to train your dog to go in a certain area, you need to know when the dog needs to go. The first thing we need to do is schedule what goes in and what goes out. You’ll want to put food and water down on a schedule. I would keep a log of what goes in and what time it goes in and what comes out and what time it comes out — and where. So, if you know your dog drinks water at 8 AM and then pees in the house by 9 AM, you can start to understand what’s going on with that dog’s biology. We need to be at the right place at the right time.\nIf you can’t figure out their schedule or they’re refusing to go outside when you take them, you might have to keep your dogconfined to a crateorleashed by your sideso he can’t wander off and do his business away from you. You want to know where he is and what he’s doing. If you see him start to sniff around, you can try to rush him to the right place. The idea is to not allow him to have the need while he’s inside and doesn’t know where to go.\nA dog food measurement by any other name would be confusing.\nReward, reward, reward.\nWhen he eventually goes outside, tell him he’s amazing. Give him a high,high value treat— make it a celebration. Eventually, he’ll learn that the yard is the most rewarding place to do his business.\nIn summary, your first goal is to be able to predict when Peach has to go, that way you can be around to show him the right place. You can do this by feeding on a schedule and keeping Peach within eyesight. Don’t punish, and don’t be afraid to experiment with outdoor spaces. It’s a big move, and Peach needs some time to adjust — but with time and patience, he’ll get a hang of suburban life.",

  "page_content": "It all started forDr. Marty Beckerin 1963: That was the year his family’s outdoor Labrador Retriever came inside the house.\nDr. Becker grew up on a small family farm that raised potatoes and other crops, in addition to cows, sheep, and pigs. Dogs served a utilitarian role on the farm — they herded cattle and guarded the property among other duties. But when a blizzard swept through in 1963, a young Dr. Becker successfully convinced his father to let their outdoor dog spend the night inside. He never left.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nIn the decades since, Dr. Becker has made a name for himself as “America’s Veterinarian”; he was the resident veterinary contributor onGood Morning Americafor 17 years, is the author of23 books, and is also the founder ofFear Free, which provides online education to veterinary and pet professionals, animal welfare communities, and pet owners. Kinshiprecently sat down with Dr. Becker to ask him about what Fear Free actually means — and why modern-day pet parents, whosepets are their children, are embracing the method.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nIt boils down to looking at [a pet’s] physical and emotional well-being. Before Fear Free, the focus was always on physical wellbeing. Most of my colleagues and I thought that fear, anxiety, and stress were collateral damage — that there was nothing you could do. You could still be compassionate, you could still look at pain, but you just had to accept that [a pet] hated going to the veterinarian or trainer or groomer.\nFear-Free training is positive reward-based training. Part of our slogan is to “put the treat into treatment.” You show [a pet] what you want them to do and then reward them when they do it, or get close to doing it. Fear Free always works to reduce or remove triggers that cause fear, anxiety, and stress.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nIf I were a therapist, I could ask you all sorts of things that happened in your life that were traumatic and you could ferret them out and we could decide we’re going to avoid this, or you’re going to deal with it this way. With a pet, you have no ideawhat happened to them. Were theyattacked by another dogwhen they were younger? Did something negative happen to them on a walk? Were they dragged out of a cage at a veterinary hospital?\n[Fear-Free training involves] the pet parent on the front end of visiting a veterinarian, groomer, or trainer. A pet parent can’t bring in a pet that’s really agitated and throwing up from stress and think it’s going to be a good visit. [Fear-Free training] starts in the living room. If a pet is going to be in a carrier, [the pet parent] got it out a week before, not the night before or the morning of. High-value rewards are given there so there are positive associations with the carrier. In transport, you keep the car at the same temperature as the house. If you’re going to a trainer, it’s the same temperature there. If the dog is in the carrier, you make sure the carrier is not tipped and covered on three sides by a light sheet to reduce visual stimuli.\nFear Free is a science-based organization. There’s over 300 studies it’s based on. We fund a decent amount of research for the size or our company. We know, for example, that pets in transport like fleece better than towels. They like pastel colors and certain types of music. It’s how pets are introduced to a facility. If somebody comes to your house or if you go to a groomer, if the pet is greeted outside in what is neutral territory, it makes a big difference, as opposed to going inside the facility, because then they’re not territorial.\n[Humans] are primarily verbal communicators and [pets are] primarily body- language communicators. Once you understand [your pet’s]body language, you almost crack the code on a different level of understanding and appreciating your dog. You get to where you’re detecting the most subtle changes early on before it erupts into something worse.\nDogs and cats can’t read self-help books, so a veterinary behaviorist explains how your pet may benefit from being in treatment.\nI was at a conference in 2009, andDr. Karen Overallgave the keynote. Her talk changed my life. Her first sentence was, “Fear is the worst thing a social species can experience, and it causes permanent damage to the brain.” Second sentence: “Those of us in veterinary medicine, training, grooming, animal services are causing repeat, severe psychological damage to pets by what we are doing or not doing.” She continued: “Behavior produces a physiologic response so behavior is medicine. Fear is caused by something painful or something disturbing.”\nShe gave some great examples. You trim a dog’snails too short.Now when they see the nail trimmer, or even the place where you trim them or the drawer that they’re held in — that’s disturbing.\nThe thing that really got me: All pets are the equivalent of a 1-year-old child. There are four reasons. One, they’re taken against their will for healthcare. Two, they have zero idea why a procedure benefits them. Three, they have no concept of time. And lastly, they have no control — they can’t flee the threat. That’s the important part; we have control over stuff that they don’t.\nThere’s nothing to fear but fear itself — and a dog who won’t stop shaking when it thunders.\nWe figured out how to do [Fear-Free training] in the veterinary hospital, in probably the worst setting. If we could remove or reduce the triggers — we call it “taking the pet out of petrified” — in that setting, we figured you could probably do it in other settings. And we thought, what good is it to have a phenomenal visit to the veterinarian when [a pet is] suffering from anxiety and stress at home?\nSo, we’ve [created certificates for] training, grooming, pet sitting, boarding, and daycare, dog walking is coming up. Everybody that has contact with a pet [should look] at both its physical and emotional well-being.\nProbably the biggest thing is that pets don’t have emotions like we do. You can’t anthropomorphize pets too much, but pets definitely have feelings. When your dog looks at you, that is the look of love. That is unmistakable; it melts you. I don’t think a human can do the same thing — it doesn’t look the same. So yes they love, yes they have fear, have anxiety, have loneliness. They have all these same things.\nThe other thing is that every single day your dog is being trained. Something happens that changes [the pet’s] behavior every day, so you have to be careful that you’re always working so the pet has the kind of manners that fit in with the happy home.\nIt’s a gut thing: Your dog’s GI issues could be linked to their mental health.\nFear Free Happy Homesis complementary to all pet parents. There’s no login or barriers. Everything we have is reviewed by [a] boarded veterinary behaviorist. That’s one of the things we’re really proud of. It’s authentic information.\nThe worst thing for a pet parent is to feel like you’re hurting your pet by trying to help them. If your pet thinks it will absolutely be harmed or is going to die when it goes to the veterinarian, that’s a red flag. If the vet insists on putting your pet up on the table every time, that’s a red flag. If they’re handling them roughly or restraining them, that’s a red flag.\nWhat [Fear Free does] is gentle control. You still get the same thing — positional compliance — but it’s designed to protect the pet. Restraint is designed to protect people. So your pet should be more cooperative in its care — they’re not showing extreme distress, they’re taking treats. You can tell if your vet has an affection for your pet and isn’t treating it like an inanimate object.\nAnd trainers — anyone that is using prongcollarsor shock collars or any kind of aversive training.\nThe questions to ask and credentials to look out for to find the right trainer foryourdog, according to a pro.\nIf you love your pet like family, I would want you to have the same level of science and soul that you would have for a human child or grandchild or nephew or niece — that physical and emotional wellbeing are important. Fear Free is where high tech meets high touch, where state of the art meets state of the heart. Yeah, we’ve got the science behind it, the studies behind it, but more than that, we love pets like family and we want to see them live happy, healthy, full lives.",

  "page_content": "Deciding to adopt your pet was probably what you’d call “a gut decision” — heavily influenced by cuteness. When it comes to our physical gut, though, there are all sorts of vitamins and supplements claiming to set things right and make you feel better.\nAlthough our pets’nosestell them more about the world than their guts might, they need some TLC in that area, too. If you’ve got a dog or cat who acts anxious or lashes out, you’ve probably tried everything from environmental changes to behavior modification to medication. But one thing you may not have considered is a deep dive into your pet’sgut microbiome.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nNot sure how gut health connects to one’s emotional response? It has to do with the gut-brain axis, which is how the digestive tract communicates back and forth with the central nervous system. If you’ve ever felt butterflies in your stomach when you’re worried, you’ve experienced thegut-brainaxis in action.\nResearchers studying the connection between gut health and mental disorders in humans have found evidence suggesting that regulating gut bacteria could help alleviate anxiety symptoms. And it turns out the same could be true for our furry friends.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nThe Gut’s Role in Mental Health\nSerotonin and dopamine are examples of “feel good” chemicals used by the brain to affect mood and decision-making. Bacteria in the gut produces the bulk of these chemicals. Other bacteria in the gut may produce chemicals that promote anxiety or mood disorders. So, it makes sense that regulating gut bacteria could affect mood or behavior. Studies have found differences in the microbiomes ofanxious miceandaggressive dogsthat could prove helpful for developing treatments and therapies.\nSteps Pet Parents Can Take\nThe thought that a healthy gut could alleviate your pet’s symptoms of anxiety or aggression may have you gleefully reaching for a container ofprobiotic-packed yogurt. But before you do, it’s best to chat with your veterinarian. Ahealthy gut is vitalfor many reasons, including breaking down food, absorbing nutrients, and maintaining a healthy immune system.\nAccording to veterinarian Dr. Jessica Heckman, “an unhealthy gut often makes itself known through soft stools or even diarrhea. These are the most common veterinary indications that a dog might benefit from probiotics.” There are alsotests availablethat can analyze the bacteria in your pet’s gut.\nShudder.It happens to all of us.\nThe food you give your pet can impact their gut health. Certain processed foods can harm the microbiome. Your veterinarian can help you determine the best diet for your pup’s needs.\nThere are some probiotic products for dogs that specifically claim to promote calm behavior and alleviate anxiety. Other probiotic supplements geared toward general digestive health are available for dogs or cats, but further research is needed to determine how well they work for reducing anxiety or aggression. Still, they may be a good option to consider if your pet is experiencing issues or as a preventive measure.\n“There’s a lot we don’t know about probiotics,” Dr. Hekman says. “Some pet owners do include them proactively; others don’t. But since they are very safe, there is no harm in doing so. Just be sure to always let your veterinarian know about any supplements you are giving your pet.”\nTime for a (literal) gut check from four experts.\nTreating anxiety or aggression in pets can be difficult and time-consuming. And it often requires a combination of therapies to address the root cause and change behaviors. Managing gut health may be one of the areas you and your pet’s healthcare team can explore. Dr. Hekman agrees.\n“With a serious behavioral issue, I recommend working with a veterinary behaviorist (rather than a non-veterinary behavior consultant) to discuss treatment,”  she says. It’s very worthwhile to discuss probiotics and the possibility of a microbiome issue with a behaviorist.”\nNo matter what you decide, it’s always best to go with your...gut.",

  "page_content": "There is no guidebook to pet parenting. In fact, you probably don’t ever want unsolicited advice from your neighbor’s cousin’s girlfriend on how to train your new puppy. But, much like regular parenting, there is a lot of misinformation out there about what you should do in any situation, like when your puppy is scared, crying, or needs a cuddle.\nMany pet parents have been taught that trying to soothe frightened dogs just makes them worse. It seems logical: Your pup hears thunder, they run to you and you pet them. Voilà, your dog just got reinforced for running to you when it thunders, and worse, for being afraid of thunderstorms in the first place. But that’s not what actually happens!\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nFirst, no amount of petting is going to make it worthwhile for your pup to work themselves into a panic for no reason. Fear is no more fun for dogs than it is for people; they wouldn‘t put themselves in that state on purpose. The function of fear is to signal the body that there is danger present, and that the individual feeling fearful had better do something to make the danger, and the fear that accompanies it, go away.\nPro tips for boosting the confidence of a scaredy-cat dog.\nThink of it this way: Imagine you’re eating ice cream when someone tries to break into your house at midnight. Would the pleasure of eating ice cream “reinforce” you for being afraid, so that you’d be more afraid the next time? If anything, things would work in the reverse — you might develop an unconscious discomfort around ice cream. However, you sure as heck aren’t going to be more afraid if a burglar arrives just because you were eating mint-chocolate chip the first time it happened.\nStudying Stress\nThere’s another reason why petting your thunder-phobic dog doesn’t make them worse: Research on thunder-phobic dogs suggests that petting does not decrease the level of stress in the dog receiving it. The authors measured the production of cortisol, a hormone related to stress. They found that cortisol levels did not decrease when the dogs were being petted by their guardians during storms. (The most important factor in decreasing cortisol was the presence of other dogs.)\nInterestingly, another piece of research on social bonding found that although cortisol levels decrease in people when they are interacting with dogs, cortisol does not decrease in dogs in the same context. However, in both species, other hormones and neurotransmitters increased, includingoxytocin, prolactin and beta-endorphin — all substances that are associated with good feelings and social bonding. So, while petting your dog during a storm may not decrease cortisol levels, it is still possible that something good could be happening.\nTips for comforting your pup when the storm is too loud for your pup’s comfort.\nOn the contrary, it’s just not possible thatpetting your dogis going to make them more fearful the next time there’s a storm. Feel free to offer them all the comfort you can, especially if they are into physical affection.\nA Classical Approach\nThe greatest damage that’s done with outdated “don’t pet the dog” advice doesn’t relate to storms but to the pitfalls of trying to explain classical counter-conditioning (CCC). CCC can be a profoundly effective way to change behavior, because it changes the emotions that drive the behavior in the first place. A typical example in applied animal behavior is having visitors throw treats to a dog who is afraid of strangers.\nUnderstandably, many humans have asked, “But isn’t giving treats when they’re barking andgrowlingjust going to make it worse? Won’t they get reinforced for barking and growling?” The answer is no — not if their behavior is driven by fear. Remember, fear is no fun, and a few pieces of food, no matter how yummy, aren’t going to override the brain’s desire to avoid it.\nNot all fearful dogs have been mistreated.\nTossing treats (or toys) to afearful dogcan teach them to associate approaching strangers with something good, as long as the treat is really, really good, and the visitor is far enough away to avoid overwhelming the dog. CCC is one of the most important tools in a trainer or behaviorist’s toolbox, yet it can be hard to convince people to try it. It feels like rewarding a dog for misbehaving, and in our punishment-oriented, “you’ve got to get dominance over your dog” society, it is tough for some people to do.\nCCC is one of many ways you can help a thunder-phobic dog. I’ve used some of the following with good success, either on their own or combined with other methods: pheromone therapy, wraps, acupuncture, acupressure, diet change, and, in serious cases, medication. If your dog is afraid of storms, you’d do well to consult a behaviorist or veterinary behaviorist for assistance in choosing the method that is right for you and your pup.\nFear Is Contagious\nYour dog watches what you do, and they trust you. So, if you are scared about something, your pup will pick up on that and might get even more afraid. The emotion of fear is so compelling that it is easy to spread around. “Emotional contagion” is the term used to describe the viral spread of fear within a group, and it’s a common occurrence among social species. If you’re afraid of storms, it is entirely possible that your dog will pick up on it and become more nervous.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nHowever, if you are freaked out (and who isn’t sometimes?), all is not lost. You cancalm things downby concentrating on your body — slowing down your breathing and your movements, changing your posture to one of confidence and relaxation, and speaking slowly and calmly (if at all). These actions have the beneficial effect of altering your own emotions as well as your dog’s.\nThe calmer you pretend to be, the calmer you’ll actually feel. And your dog, who looks to you with those adorable puppy-dog eyes, will chill out, too.\nSources:Nancy Dreschel, DVM, & Douglas Granger, PhD. 2005. “Physiological and behavioral reactivity to stress in thunderstorm-phobic dogs and their caregivers,” Applied Animal Behaviour Science 95:153–168.\nJ.S.J.

We’ve taken him to the vet and he received a clean bill of health. How can we stop our dog from scent marking our house — and ourselves?\"\nScent marking is a very normal and common behavior, particularly in male dogs, but it becomes a big problem when marking occurs in your house. Dogs mark to advertise their presence and to claim territory and resources. Pee and poop contain pheromones, or chemical messages, that convey information — age, gender, health, and reproductive status — about the dog doing the marking.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nResources such as toys, food bowls, chew treats, bones, and beds are the most likely objects to be marked. As you’ve experienced, a dog will also actually mark a person or something that smells heavily of that person, such as a sofa or bed.\nEven though marking can have a dominant and competitive component, it may also occur if a dog is overstimulated — for example, during or after vigorous play — orbecomes anxiousin a particular situation, such aswhen a person leaves. This common expression of anxiety in dogs is often mistaken for spite, resulting in punishment, which only serves to increase the anxious behavior. Scent marking is also more common in multi-dog households where dogs compete for space, resources, and human attention.\nKeep the faith; you can fix this pee-action.\nUnlike withsubmissive urinationwhich is typical in puppies, both sexes scent mark, but intact males are the worst offenders, as signaling sexual availability and claiming territory is “encouraged” by the presence of testosterone. In many cases, neutering can significantly reduce a dog’s desire to scent mark, but some continue even after they have been neutered.\nHow to Stop a Dog from Marking\nAlthough this is a difficult behavior to break, taking the following steps can improve the situation.\nRemove high-value resources that encourage competitive marking, and do not allow the dog or dogs who scent mark to roam freely throughout the home.\nRemove high-value resources that encourage competitive marking, and do not allow the dog or dogs who scent mark to roam freely throughout the home.\nPrevent access to favorite marking spots by restricting the dog(s) to a dog-proofed room or crate when you are unable to actively supervise them.\nPrevent access to favorite marking spots by restricting the dog(s) to a dog-proofed room or crate when you are unable to actively supervise them.\nAvoid competitive or vigorous play indoors, as excess activity encourages urination.\nAvoid competitive or vigorous play indoors, as excess activity encourages urination.\nWhencleaning up accidents, it is important to be sure that there is no underlying urine smell left.

Most dogs raised in a normal domestic situation respond well to a good house-training schedule, but those who have lived in puppy mills are notoriously difficult.\nDogs are essentially clean animals and do not like to toilet where they sleep and eat, but because puppy mill dogs are confined to cramped cages, they are forced to do just that. This makescrate training(a usually successful way to house train a dog) much less effective. However, even puppy mill dogs can be taught to toilet appropriately. You'll need to go back to house training basics. Here's how:\nAllow access to outside areas every hour, then make less-frequent trips as the dog builds up control.\nAllow access to outside areas every hour, then make less-frequent trips as the dog builds up control.\nFollow a schedule to establish a ritual of behavior, which will eventually become predictable and reliable.\nFollow a schedule to establish a ritual of behavior, which will eventually become predictable and reliable.\nThe bottom line: Every dog needs to feel confident about going to the bathroom.

How do I get Ranboo to come when I call him? — Christie\nCongratulations on your new puppy! It’s very possible to teach an old dog new tricks, but it’s ideal to start as early as possible with a young dog. This way Ranboo will be a recall pro for life. For both your safety, getting Ranboo to come when he’s called is a training must-do. As you’ve already figured out, it’s not as easy as it sounds. But with time and patience, even the most stubborn pup can learn to come when called.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nSet him up for success.\nAs with all basic training, you want to start where your dog can be successful. If you take Ranboo to the most challenging and complicated situation and ask him to learn a new skill, you’re setting him up to fail. He’s going to learn to ignore you.\nPeople will often take their dog to a dog park and start calling the dog. The dog hasn’t learned to come to you under those kind of distractions, and they ignore you. If you chase after them to try to catch them, they think it’s great fun. When they finally listen and come over to you, you might put them on a leash, tell them they’re a bad dog and leave the park. So the dog says to themself, “When I finally did listen, I lost the park.” This is a bad lesson for a dog to learn, because they won’t want to come to you if they’re going to lose out on play time.\nAnother common mistake people make is they practice thestaycommand and then call for their dog. You want to avoid this because it teaches the dog to be ready to break the stay at any moment, which doesn’t help your stay training. It also teaches the dog that they should be sitting still and staring at you before coming.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a shy pup to go from wallflower to social butterfly.\nSet up the cue and start practicing.\nA six month old dog is just starting to hit adolescence and explore their own independence. It’s easy to run into problems if you’re inconsistent with training a dog this age, so be sure to control his environment and set a consistent cue.\nYou should start inside with no distractions and high value treats. You can stand in front of Ranboo and give the cue. It’s extremely important to keep the cue the same — if you say “Ranboo, come,” for example, that has to stay your cue. Not “Ranboo,”  not “Come here, Ranboo” — it’s “Ranboo, come.” That’s it. Again, that’s just an example — choose a cue that works for you!\nMake it fun!\nSay your cue and move back a few steps. Get excited about it. Treat it as a game instead of a command.\nGive the command, move backward by three or five feet, and give your dog a high value treat when he follows. Do that around the house for a little bit. Another game you can play is if you have more than one person in the house, you can call the dog back and forth across a room and eventually do this throughout the household, in different rooms.\nYou can even turn it into a game of hide and seek. If you have a house with kids, the kids and dog will both love this. You can go around doors or duck behind the countertop and call the dog until they find you in a new space.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s pro tips for walking a pup that wantsto chase everything that moves.\nLevel-up your location.\nOnce Ranboo seems to have an understanding of the cue and he runs to you when you call him, you can go outside to a park or beach or open space. Again, don’t go straight to a dog park, because that’s a challenging environment. You want to go somewhere peaceful where a dog can be successful.\nI would invest in a 30-foot leash — or maybe 50, depending on the space you have. Bring him to a park or a basketball court where that’s not a lot going on. Put him on a long leash and let him wander and check things out at five or ten feet away from you.\nIf Ranboo is sniffing the ground ten feet away and you give a cue and he turns and pays attention, get excited. Tell him he’s good. Get low, clap your hands, run away a bit – do something excited that makes the dog want to follow you. Punctuate that with a high value reward so the dog sees that coming away from the thing he’s exploring and coming to you is where the treat is.\nOver time, you can increase the distance and increase the distraction. That might mean Ranboo is at the full length of the thirty foot leash and sniffing the grass or watching dogs play. This isn’t necessarily something you’re doing on a city street; this should be somewhere where you have control over the environment.\nFor dogs who are really strong, you should be careful with a long leash so you don’t hurt your wrist or get your legs swept out from under you. In some cases, you can tether the dog to a tree or pole to make sure you’re not going to get hurt.\nGet to the dog park.\nEventually, you can go to a dog park. Wait for the dog to have a moment when you feel that they can listen to you. For example, if I was at the park with my dog and she was engaged with three of her dog friends, I might wait a second. When she breaks off to the side to catch her breath, that’s when I would call her over to tell her she’s the best. I’d give her a treat or some water and a quick belly rub, then let her go back to play.",

Resource guarding may include behaviors such as growling, tooth displaying, stiffening, frantic eating, glaring, snapping, barking, and biting. Dogs commonly guard food, treats, bones, and rawhides.\nHow To Stop Food Aggression in Dogs\nYou want your dog to feel happy when you approach them while they’re eating, and even when you reach toward their bowl or take it away. Dogs who are happy about your approach are not going to growl or snap to get you to leave. If you regularly walk by a dog who is eating and toss atreatto them, you are teaching them to anticipate a treat whenever you approach them at their food bowl. Once they learn that your approach predicts something good, they’ll be happy to see you coming.\nTo begin, walk by your dog as they’re eating and toss a treat without stopping. Do this only one to two times during any feeding session and don’t do it every time your dog is eating. Overdoing it can cause a dog to feel irritable, the same way you feel in a restaurant when a waiter refills your water glass after every sip.\nTo begin, walk by your dog as they’re eating and toss a treat without stopping.

  "page_content": "“She must have been abused,” is a comment I hear with alarming regularity. When a dog cowers and shakes or barks and growls at a person wearing a hat, it’s natural to think that the strong reaction is proof of previous harsh treatment by someone wearing a hat. It’s easy to conclude that a dog who’s scared of children was teased by the neighborhood bully. Similarly, it’s logical to assume that a dog would only react aversely to a broom after having had terrifying experiences with one.\nWithout a doubt, fartoo many dogs suffer abuse, but not all dogs who appear to have been abused have necessarily been treated badly. Some are fearful because they were inadequately socialized, or have a genetic tendency to be fearful, or both. As often as not, a history of abuse is actually not a factor.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nWhy Some Dogs Are Afraid of Men\nThe most common scenario that leads people to conclude that a dog has been abused is the dog who’s fine with women but scared of men. In these cases, while it’s possible that a man abused the dog, the fact that a dog is afraid of men doesn’t prove the theory. Typically, dogs who havefearful tendenciesare more scared of men than of women. I’ve met hundreds of dogs who were only scared of men, and exactly two who feared women more. The fact is, dogs who are fearful have a natural propensity to be more afraid of men. Nobody knows for sure why this is, but it’s likely that men’s larger size, broader shoulders, deeper voices and facial hair make them more intimidating.\nAnother reason that dogs might be more afraid of men was suggested by a study reported inCurrent Biology:When motion was detected only on point light displays*, observers perceived an interesting difference between male and female movement. Figures considered masculine in gait seemed to be approaching, while both feminine and gender-neutral gaits were seen as heading away. Fearful dogs are typically most frightened when something scary moves toward them — this may explain why they find men more alarming than women.\nPro tips for boosting the confidence of a scaredy-cat dog.\nHow Scent Plays into Fear\nScent may also be a factor: “Olfactory exposure to males, including men, causes stress and related analgesia in rodents,” according to a report inNature Methods.The study showed that mice and rats react differently to male and female experimenters because of differences in the way that they smell. That means that all studies of these rodents’ behavior may have been influenced by the gender of the people conducting the study. The test animals became highly stressed and exhibited decreased pain responses in the presence of human males; even T-shirts worn by men (but not those worn by women) caused this reaction.\nThe rodents were similarly stressed by odors from males of a range of species, including dogs, cats, guinea pigs and even other rodents. Males release certain pheromones in larger concentrations than females — and these fear-inducing chemicals are shared among mammals — which means that dogs could also be affected by them. Scent differences could very likely affect dogs and cause them to be more frightened around some people.\nMisunderstandings About Fearful Dogs\nThe assumption that fear of men indicates a history of abuse by a man is not the only one that may be erroneous. Many people are sure thatdogs who react negativelyto people with hats or backpacks means there has been past abuse by a person sporting those same accessories. While again, this is possible, it’s more likely that the dog is simply unfamiliar with the objects themselves and the way that they change people’s appearance. Many react fearfully to a changed silhouette, becoming frightened, for example, by the sight of someone they know and love wearing a hat. Once the person removes the hat, the dog switches to happy greeting behavior.\nAnother commonly misunderstood area relates to the fear of children. Many dogs are skittish around children because of their erratic behavior, especially if they were not well socialized to them at an early age. After all, from a dog’s perspective, kids behave in peculiar and unexpected ways. They change direction suddenly, roll on the ground, move at variable speeds, make weird noises and are generally high-energy hurricanes. Dogs who are naturally fearful may find excitable, loud humans in motion to be unpredictable, which is frightening. (On the flip side, there are fearful dogs who do fine with kids, but are terrified of adults. Usually, such dogs have had positive experiences with children and are used to their erratic behavior.)\nUsing these tips, your skittish dog will warm up to you.\nHow to Tell if a Fearful Dog Has Been Abused\nIf a dog’s fearfulness toward specific types of people or certain everyday items doesn’t necessarily mean that the dog has been abused, how can you tell if your dog suffered from abuse in the past? The honest answer is that — unless you have the dog’s full backstory —  you can never know for certain. However, some clues may help you make an educated guess. Abuse is less likely as an explanation for a dog’s fearfulness if the dog’s reactions fit the pattern associated with dogs who are naturally fearful.\nThe most common pattern is for such dogs to be cautious around strangers, especially men, and to be worse around tall, deep-voiced men with beards, or anyone carrying things — garden tools, brooms or mops, a clipboard — or wearing sunglasses, a backpack, or a hat. Dogs with a generally fearful approach to the world often react most vigorously when unfamiliar people approach, look directly at them, stand up from a sitting position or reach down to pet them.\nIf the dog has sustained multiple injuries, such as broken bones or teeth, or has scars on its face and body, abuse is more likely. Of course, those injuries could be a result of accidents, and some forms of abuse leave no scars. Still, a dog with unexplained evidence of physical trauma is more likely to have been a victim of abuse than a dog without it.\nIf a dog is fearful of highly specific attributes, it is more likely to be based on trauma, which could have come in the form of abuse. So, if a dog is afraid of freckled, redheaded children with glasses in the age range of 10 to 12 years, but fine with all other kids, it’s more likely that a negative experience with a child of that description caused the fear. On the other hand, if a dog is only okay with children who are older than about 16, my bet would be that the dog lacks experience with a wide range of children and is only comfortable with children who are more adult-like in size and behavior. Similarly, if the dog is okay with men unless they are wearing loafers with a buckle, I would be inclined to suspect abuse. Specificity of fears is more likely to indicate abuse, because dogs who are generally fearful are usually set off by a wider range of triggers.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nOther Exceptions to Keep In Mind\nEven in the case of a specific fear, we have to be careful about assuming that abuse was the cause. For example, I had a client whose dog was fearful of and aggressive toward only one person. Sounds like that person might have beaten the dog, right? Not in this case. The man the dog was afraid of was the neighbor who had saved the dog’s life during a house fire; the wonderful man went into the house and carried the dog out before the firefighters arrived. Until then, the dog liked this man, but was terrified of him after the fire, presumably because he associated the man with the horrible experience.\nWhile anyone who loves dogs wants to know if a particular dog has been abused, the same process is used to help a dog overcome fears of any origin. Classical conditioning, desensitization and patience will serve people and dogs equally well. It’s critical not to force a frightened dog into situations that provoke fear, but instead, to protect the dog from scary circumstances. Be gentle and kind and refrain from using punishment. Feel free to comfort any dog who is scared without worrying about the common (but misplaced) warning that this will reinforce the fear. Accept that many fearful dogs never become gregarious, go-with-the-flow types, and love them for who they are rather than who you think they should be.\nSome people seem relieved when I tell them that their dog may not have been abused, while others seem disappointed to give up the “feel good” story of adopting a dog who was mistreated. I empathize with both groups: I can understand the relief, and I can also understand how gratifying it feels to give a loving home to a dog who only knew cruelty before. And while I certainly can’t say definitively which dogs with unknown histories have been abused and which haven’t, I agree with other progressive trainers and behaviorists that abused dogs are not as common as one might think.\n* Point-light displays are made by filming people, animals or objects with reflective markers or point lights attached to the major joints, and then processing the video so that only the point lights are visible.",

But the question remains: What about our pets? Do they deal with similar concerns, and how can we help them if they do?\nSome pets live with anxiety or fear. Some have compulsive disorders, such as constant licking, pacing, or chasing imaginary objects. Others exhibit behaviors that may be perfectly normal for them (likebarking, scratching furniture, orchewing) but drive their humans up the wall. In all of these instances, behavioral therapy can help make the home a happier place for pets and their humans. To get the scoop on how a behavior treatment plan might help your pet, we talked to a board-certified veterinary behaviorist, Dr. Kat Pankratz.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nTypes of Behavioral Support\nThe first thing to understand is that, much like humans, every pet is different. Their behaviors may appear common, but the severity and underlying causes vary. A skilled professional can assess your pet and provide tools and resources to address the challenges at hand. When choosing a professional, the options range from trainers to general practice veterinarians to veterinary specialists. All can provide helpful support, though their education, skillsets, and capabilities differ. Dr. Pankratz breaks down the distinctions.\n“A board-certified veterinary behaviorist (Diplomat of the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists or DACVB, orveterinary behaviorist) is a veterinarian who underwent additional years of training, board examination with certification, and continues to maintain current knowledge of the scientific understanding of all aspects of animal behavior,” explains Dr. Pankratz. “Veterinary behaviorists have the skills to assess the pet as a whole: physically and mentally. We can diagnose behavior conditions and formulate a comprehensive treatment plan.”\nHow to cope with dog anxiety—from training to medication.\n“A general practitioner veterinarian can also diagnose and create a treatment plan,” she continues. “The extent of their ability to diagnose and formulate a behavior treatment plan varies depending on the individual veterinarian’s comfort with behavioral medicine. Although their understanding of animal behavior may not have the depth or breadth of a DACVB, a general practitioner interested in behavior can be an important start.”\n“The general titlestrainerandbehavioristhave no restrictions for their use.Certified trainershave undergone some education or training to receive one of several certifications. Though there are exceptions, many trainers that focus on obedience training may not have sufficient skills to support the emotional change needed to treat behavioral problems. Trainers should not diagnose and cannot prescribe therapeutics that require a prescription. However, they can provide a helpful perspective to guide pet owners to seek veterinary support if they suspect the pet might benefit from a medical evaluation or possibly a therapeutic prescription.”\nA (seemingly) unstoppable nibbling obsession with all the blankets.\nManaging Nuisance Behaviors\nDigging holes in the backyard, clawing your couch cushions, andjumping up on house guestsare a few examples of behaviors that your pet probably loves (and for them come naturally) but that you could do without. The fact that these actions bum you out is reason enough to address them. But sometimes, these behaviors can also affect a pet’s quality of life.\n“Any behavior that reaches a point where it impacts a pet’s ability to eat, drink, rest, or engage in enjoyable activities could be a sign of something more pathologic,” Dr. Pankratz says. “In situations like that, seeking trusted professional advice would be recommended.”\nRegardless of whether it’s normal behavior or a pathologic condition, a trained professional can help. It may be a matter of changing up your pet’s environment or exercise routine to ensure their needs are being met. Or, your pet may have an underlying medical issue that requires diagnosis and treatment. In either instance, addressing the problems will make home life happier for you and your pet.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s pro tips for getting a hyped-up dog to chill out.\nPotential Treatment Plans for Anxious, Fearful, or Aggressive Pets\nSome of the most challenging issues to address manifest as anxiety, aggression, or fear. We don’t always know what types of trauma or stress our pets have faced, but that doesn’t mean we can’t find ways to help. As noted earlier, a veterinary behaviorist has the most tools in the toolbox to address a pet’s physical and emotional needs. According to Dr. Pankratz, a veterinary behaviorist’s treatment plan may incorporate components of environmental management, behavior modification, and therapeutics.\nIn your own life, you probably go out of your way to avoid things that trigger you. Environmental management is all about helping your pet do the same.\n“This part of a treatment plan focuses on adjusting the environment for the pet to meet their physical and mental needs,” Dr. Pankratz says. “Modifying the environment aims to decrease exposure to stimuli that cause negative emotional states for the pet. Avoiding that stimuli helps maintain safety and prevents the pet from repeating unwanted behaviors. The goal is to set the pet up to success, so there is little opportunity to perform the unwanted behaviors, or be placed in a circumstance that might cause negative emotions.”\nThe toys that’ll help your pup chill out after a long day of being a dog.\nDo you ever take deep breaths when you need to calm down? Or ease into situations that you know you’ll find stressful? As humans, when we can’t avoid the things that bother us, we have to learn how to cope with them. It’s the same for pets, and behavior modification can help.\n“Behavior modification focuses on adjusting a pet’s emotional state,” Dr. Pankratz says. “The primary focuses include changing a pet’s emotional state from negative to positive and helping them develop coping skills to navigate difficult situations. This style of training is different from obedience training, as it focuses on empowering the pet to learn how to feel differently. This often starts in an environment that is very comfortable for the pet. When that pet has built sufficient foundational learning, we build on those skills thoughtfully and systematically in constructed learning opportunities that gradually build in difficulty based on that individual pet’s progress.”\nHow to teach your dog to enjoy, notdestroy, their toys.\nIs there a pill for that? Yes, sometimes there is.\n“Therapeutics vary from over-the-counter products to prescriptions,” Dr. Pankratz says. “The intent is to help dial down the intensity of negative emotions. Although sometimes the response can be incredible, therapeutics by themselves often do not eliminate the negative emotions altogether (thus the importance of the other two parts of the treatment plan). The goals of therapeutics are to decrease the negative emotions enough so the pet can better learn what is being taught instead of quickly escalating over-threshold, or to assist in a faster recovery after a triggering event. The goal of therapeutics should rarely be to sedate the pet or change their personality.”\nWhat You Can Do as a Pet Parent\nYou’ve already completed step one: research ways to help your pet through behavioral challenges.\nThe next best thing you can do is be a diligent observer and scribe. That means paying close attention to your pet’s behavior and what is going on around them when the behaviors occur. It’s also important to keep notes on recent changes in your pet’s life. Did you put them on a new medication? Get a new pet? Move to another home? Any information you can provide to the team of people supporting you will help them create the most effective treatment plan for your pet.",

  "page_content": "Milo, my one year old Lab mix, is very curious and excitable outside with all small animals — squirrels, chipmunks — people, and other dogs. How can I train him to remain calm outside with so many distractions? — Tatyana\nMilo sounds like a fun, confident adolescent with enough enthusiasm to go around. I assume when you say “curious and excitable” you mean pulling on leash, lurching toward small animals, and jumping up on people and dogs. This can make walks unpleasant and social interactions stressful for you as well as those you encounter in your travels. The good news is it sounds like he is brave, smart, and excited to meet life head-on which will serve him well for years to come. Here are some tips to help him stay chill while doing so.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nFirst, set Milo up for success.\nStart small and train in a space that has minimal distractions. Training while he is overwhelmed by too many distractions is going to be a non-starter. He will need you to give clear information at a time and place where he can be calm and focused. You can then slowly increase his distractions over time. But you can’t teach him if you can’t get and hold his attention.\nI would suggest starting leash training indoors where he can be more focused. Use a mix of medium and high-value rewards to encourage him to stay to one side and stay focused on you. Pick one side of your body to be the “dog side.” Be sure to keep your body relaxed and the pressure off the leash. Dogs have a reflex to pull against pressure called an oppositional reflex. The more you pull back on his collar or harness, the harder his will pull against it. We are looking for a casual loose leash walk.\nConnect rewards with good behavior.\nManage your expectations and focus on small victories. Don’t dangle treats in his face to hold his focus. Instead, keep them up towards your chest to encourage him to look up at you. As you walk and he keeps next to you with a loose leash, mark his good behavior with a “yes” andreward him with the treat. Using a reward sound such as “yes” helps connect the good behavior to the reward. Try to keep the reward sound novel so your dog can more easily connect it solely with reward. Words like “good” or “good boy” tend to lose meaning over time because the dog hears it in so many different contexts.\nTry not to produce treats only to regain his attention when he loses focus. Instead, keep a steady stream of rewards for good behavior. You can then fade to treats over time as he becomes more and more focused and reliable. During this stage, try to avoid areas and activities that will be overwhelming to him or allow him to engage in the overstimulating behaviors.\nLevel up his enrichment.\nI would also increase his environmental enrichment in the home. Feeding him through interactivefood dispensing toys, training games andscent games like “find it”are fun and easy ways to engage him in the mental stimulation that he seems to be craving outside. These activities also give him a chance to practice focusing and seeing you as a source of fun and excitement.\nSlowly increase distractions.\nOnce he is able to stay focused on you and keep the leash nice and slack, try bringing him to an area with slightly more distractions such as a yard or quiet street. Repeat the exercise rewarding him for staying focused and keeping a loose leash. Once he is choosing to focus on you, gradually move to more and more distracting locations. Avoid moving too fast. Remember, even the brightest fifth grader will fail the high school regents exam. Your goal is to meet Milo where he is at and set him up for the most success. This keeps training fun for you both and encourages him to stay engaged. Everyone likes doing well.\nFind the right gear.\nYou may want to explore some other equipment options as well. No pull harnesses can be very effective. These areharnesseswhere the leash is attached to a clip in front of the dog’s chest, instead of his back between the shoulder blades. This moves you in front of the dog’s center of gravity and can provide leverage. Leaning his weight against the leash is less effective and makes it less likely to engage the oppositional reflex.\nBe sure you read the harness instructions and size it correctly. Some very determined pullers will lean sideways against the pressure and pull using their shoulders. This can have negative effects on his joints and should be avoided over the long term.\nHead collars are also a good option. These go around the muzzle, resembling a horse bridle. When used correctly, these can be very effective in curbing pulling and lunging while being minimally aversive. It will take time to get him comfortable wearing it and you will want to expose him to it slowly while making positive associations over time.\nIf you just slap it on his face and start walking, he will most likely react poorly and the device can become intrusive and uncomfortable. When the time is taken to desensitize him to the head collar, it can be an incredibly effective anti-pulling tool. Remember, dogs will repeat behavior that works for them. If pulling works less and focusing on you works more, he will choose to walk calmly by your side.\nCounter-condition his prey drive.\nWhen it comes to small animals outside, it is likely you are working against Milo’s genetic disposition to chase these irresistible critters. Once you have utilized tools and techniques that prevent his lunging and established a solid training routine around distractions, you can start gradual exposure sessions around the chasing behaviors and triggers. This may begin with simply being in a place where he has seen small animals in the past.\nDogs usually remember trees and hedges frequented by squirrels and chipmunks. If you can get him to work on your walking and training skills without him fixating on the possibility of seeing a squirrel, you’re off to a great start. Practicing some basic manners like “leave it, watch me, and let’s go” in these areas will improve your experience even more.\nEventually, try to engineer situations where you are a good distance from foraging squirrels and maintain his focus and response to training cues. Expect this to take quite a bit of practice and time. It will require plenty of management; you are likely fighting nature a bit here. You can also practice impulse control around humans and other dogs who are easier to enlist in helping. Have Milo on leash as he approaches one of his favorite people. As you approach, praise and reward him for his calm behavior. Once he begins to pull or jump, you can about face and walk a few feet until he is calm again. This teaches him that a calm approach will gain access to the person and pulling or jumping will lose access. Repeat this until he can approach relatively calmly and say hello. Pairing the presence of other dogs to reward can condition Milo to focus on you when he sees a dog which can be incredibly useful.\nBuild your bond and a regular routine.\nIt is important to note that you shouldn’t count on any device to do the training for you. The training comes from you motivating behavior, limiting his distractions, and rewarding his good decisions. Your relationship and bond is the strongest training tool you have and time should be taken to develop that tool above all. Try to think of it as a game you both want to play. I would suggest working on leash skills when he is hungry and you have all the good treats! Don’t get discouraged; be patient. Remember you are his teacher and practice makes progress. You will need to work for a while to build a solid routine, especially when he is so easily overwhelmed by his environment.\nPractice regular impulse control exercises.\nYour training routine should go beyond leash training alone. Manners matter; building a strong foundation of basic cues is just as important. All dogs should be fluent in “sit, stay, lay down, go to your place, drop it, and leave it.” Once a basic cue is learned you can incorporate it in a deference routine — meaning your dog defers to you for things.\nEverything Milo wants should be filtered through you and earned using his learned skills. For example, when Milo wants to go outside or come up on the couch, he should offer a learned behavior like “sit” or “down” before being invited to have access. This gets him in the habit of pausing and looking to you for guidance. This should be done consistently with positive reinforcement and with no force or ill will.\nAnother great exercise for impulse control is using “go to your place” and “stay” as part of a relaxation exercise. This is essentially building your dog’s “stay” cue up to a point where you are adding higher and higher levels of distraction. Having a dog who knows to stay while you take a few steps away is a great start, but having a dog who will stay while you do yoga or answer the door is a truly useful behavior. It is a great way to help Milo learn to remain calm while things are happening around him. It also follows a golden rule: teach your dog what theyshoulddo, not only what they shouldn’t do.\nFind the right help.\nIt’s okay to seek help andfind a Certified Professional Dog Trainerwho practices LIMA (Least Intrusive, Minimally Aversive) techniques. The Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers and the International Association of Animal Behavior Counselors both have a “Locate a Trainer” search tool on their site. A certified trainer with lots of experience should be able to help you sharpen Milo’s skills and offer guidance to help manage his impulses. Training will strengthen your bond with Milo and enrich your relationship for many years to come.",

The Whippet is no problem, but the Aussie barks and runs around like a crazy thing, which makes leashing him a challenge. He's a very big dog, with a big bark! Once the leash is on, he takes it in his mouth and jumps all over the place. Walking is also a challenge because he’s always trying to grab the leash. Any suggestions?\nThat sounds hectic! It’s no fun walking a dog who seems to be on a pogo stick and is grabbing at the leash to boot. When another dog is along (no matter how well behaved), it can feel even that much crazier.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nIt’s a common scene — your dog’s hyped to go on a walk but once the leash is on, they take it in their mouth andjump all over the place. It can be frustrating and makewalking a challengebecause they’re always trying to grab the leash. When another dog comes along, no matter how well-behaved,it can feel even crazier. This hectic dance takes all the fun —and many of the benefits— out of dog walking. But it doesn’t have tostall all attemptsto venture outside with your pup.\nThere are definitely things you can do to makethese outingsbetter for everyone. One of the best ways to keep the leash out of the dog’s mouth is to give them something else to put in it — say, a toy they can carry. If their mouth is occupied, they’ll be less likely to be interested in grabbing the leash.\nDog trainer Karen B. London promises you’re not doomed to be pulled down the street forever.\nHowever, you may have to experiment a bit to find something they like better than they like to bite the leash. Safety is the primary consideration, but beyond that, let the dog’s interests guide you, while making sure the item is too large for them to choke on it. Good options include a ball, rope tug toy, fleece animal, or flying disc. Many dogs will happily carry a stick, but sticks can be dangerous due to splinters and mouth and throat punctures. If your dog is a true stick lover, try a toy designed to mimic one. For example,Konghas a few longer heavy-duty options for many stick-loving dogs.\nThis potential solution may seem overly simple, but don’t let that stop you from giving it a try. Many dogs get super amped up about going for a walk, and when they’re in that state, they become very mouthy, and the leash is right there. By providing the dog with an outlet for their need to grab something, you’re allowing them to give in to their urge without driving you insane — it may just solve the problem.",

    "title": "My Dog Is Misbehaving. What Should I Do?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/misbehaving-dog"
  },
  "page_content": "When living or working with a dog who’s not doing what you want them to do, it’s natural to feel as though they’re intentionally misbehaving or causing trouble. You might even assume that the fault lies with the dog. But when you blame the dog, it will ultimately just impede progress towards your training goals. So, what should you do when a dog misbehaves?\nConsider why your dog is misbehaving.\nIn my experience, dogs who aren’t doing what you ask need help (practice, information, or compassion), notcorrection(anger, disgust, or disappointment). The dog may not understand the cue given; they may not have had enough practice to do it reliably; they may be too distracted, stressed, or afraid.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nTo figure out what the issue is, consider this: The dog is notgivingyou a hard time, but rather, they’rehavinga hard time. For whatever reason, they’re not doing as we ask because they can’t. Something is getting in their way, whether it’s their emotional state, their context, or because they haven’t had enough training to succeed. With that in mind, you need to ask yourself how you can help them accomplish the task at hand.\nOne of the first steps — and I don’t say this in an accusatory way — is to stop putting all the blame on the dog. Training a dog is a cooperative enterprise; we teach dogs how to behave, and they learn what to do when we make specific requests of them. By taking responsibility, you switch from the idea that your dog is “misbehaving” to the realization that you need to make it easier for your dog when they’re not succeeding.\nWhat to do when your dog misbehaves.\nWith that in mind, here are the most common strategies professional dog trainers use to “fix” the problem of a dog who is not responding to commands. Each method requires accepting that it is the pet parent’s responsibility to help their dog so they can learn to do what is asked of them.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s pro tips for walking a pup that wantsto chase everything that moves.\nStart with the basics: do more training and usepositive reinforcementfor all your training. If your dog resists going into a down, start making “down” their ticket to the good things in life. Ask them to lie down before you go for a walk, before you let them out, before you feed them, before you give them a new toy or a treat — you get the idea. Once they learn to associate lying down with whatever makes them happy, they will be more likely to lie down in new and different contexts.\nEach time you reward a dog after performing the desired action, they’re more likely to do that same action again in the future because of positive reinforcement. By helping your dog make this connection a lot of times, you build a strong reinforcement history with a behavior, making it more likely that your dog will perform it.\nDogs, contrary to old-school ideas, don’t want to please us. They want to do what is pleasing to them. For that matter, individuals of every species, including our own, act in ways that cause good things to happen for them. Using positive reinforcement (and lots of it!) is the way to align what your dog wants to do with what you want them to do.\nA fundamental principle of dog training is to repeatedly set your dog up for success. We can only reinforce the behavior we want if that behavior occurs, so we must increase the odds of the behavior happening. Creating situations in which the behavior is highly likely to occur and then reinforcing it makes it more likely to occur in the future. With lots of repetition in increasingly challenging situations, the dog will be able to perform the desired behavior in a broader range of contexts.\nFor example, suppose your dogbarks and lunges whenever they see another dogwhile out on a walk. How can you get them to act appropriately inthissituation? The answer is to set them up for success by not putting them in situations they are guaranteed to fail. Instead, introduce them to situations where they’ll have a positive outcome and gradually increase the level of difficulty as they get better at dealing with it. What they can handle is a moving target, but it must be moved gradually.\nHere’s one scenario: Enlist a friend with a calm dog (or even a stuffed dog if a real dog is too much of a challenge) to stand roughly a block away. After walking with your dog a few feet in their direction, ask them to turn and walk in another direction or to look at you. Then, break out the treats, praise, toys, or other reinforcement to reward them for doing what you ask. That’s a success, and you set them up for that success by staying at a distance from a stationary dog who would normally trigger their aggression if moving nearby. As they get better at this, make the situation slightly more challenging, perhaps by walking a little closer to the target dog or seeing a dog in the distance moving rather than standing still. Gradually increasing the difficulty and helping your dog to have multiple successes at each level is the best way to help your dog improve.\nDog trainer Pat Miller’s pro tips for preventing your pup from darting out the door.\nWhen we manage a situation to prevent trouble, we are doing our dogs a big favor. Do you have a dog who doesn’t reliably come when called? Don’t let them off-leash in an area that is not fenced. They can’t handle that amount of freedom which will only lead to negative consequences:\nThey will ignore you when you call them to come.\nThey will ignore you when you call them to come.\nThey will learn that you can’t make them come or catch them.\nThey will learn that you can’t make them come or catch them.\nThey may put themselves in danger.\nThey may put themselves in danger.\nLong leashes and fences keep them from getting themself into trouble while they’re learninga solid recall. Similarly, if they act in an out-of-control way when people come to the door, you can prevent that chaos by giving them a stuffed Kong or a chew toy to keep them occupied before visitors arrive, or have them on the other side of a gate to keep them from leaping on your guests. That’smanaging the situationto make it easier for them to do the right thing. The same goes for door darting dogs — it is your job to prevent your dog from escaping by using gates, leashes, or keeping the door closed. Prevent undesired behavior while you work on training your dog to have a better recall.\nThere may be many reasons your dog isn’t doing what you want: the presence of distractions; a new context; a less-than-calm emotional state —scared, stressed, anxious, nervous, excited, agitated, or upset in some other way; an unclear cue; even discomfort or pain.\nOne secret of dog training is that teaching a dog to perform a behavior on cue is only the first step in truly training that dog. A large part of our efforts must go toward teaching the dog to do a cued behavior in a variety of situations and contexts. There’s a big difference between asking your dog to come when they’re in the backyard and to come when they’re running free through the neighborhood, or to roll over in the family room when nothing’s going on and to roll over immediately after entering the dog park when a dozen dogs have just swarmed them.\nWhile this makes sense, it may be difficult to recognize more subtle challenges to a dog’s ability to respond as you wish, such as the scent of steaks on the neighbor’s grill, a storm in the distance, or a visitor watching as we try to show off our dog’s new trick. Other things like giving hand signals while wearing gloves or a thick winter coat may change the movements or cause anxiety making the dog incapable of concentrating on even simple tasks, such as sitting on request.\nOnce you recognize the possible reasons your dog is not doing what you want, you are far more likely to be able to solve the problem. If your dog is scared, you can help them overcome their fears, remove them from the situation that’s scaring them, or lower your expectations while they’re in that scary situation. You can help them move away from distractions or ask them to do something easier until youregain their full attention.\nSay What? A look at the types of words that dogs understand.\nWhen you empathize with how hard it can be for your dog to learn all the skills you want them to have and to respond to your cues no matter what’s going on around them, or going on internally, you can more easily train them.\nTry not to think of your dog as being stubborn or misbehaving — don’t complain that your dog has a mind of their own. Of course, they do. Dogs are independent beings. There’s no reason to expect that they’ll do what we want unless we give them a reason. We make that happen with prevention and management, by setting them up for success and using a lot of positive reinforcement, and looking for reasons they aren’t responding as we want them to.\nRather than describing a dog using the words “stubborn,” “rebellious,” “disobedient,” “ignoring,” “refusing,” or “misbehaving,” look for ways to turn things around. To achieve the goal of a better-trained dog, the shift must start in your mind, with a change in perspective.\nTraining will be more successful, and your dog’s behavior will improve when you recognize your role in the process. By correcting your own mistakes, you can have a dog who does as you ask. That makes your relationship better, your interactions more fun, and allows your dog to have more freedom.",

  "page_content": "Nobody likes spending upwards of $20 on a dog toy only to have the shark-disguised-as-a-dog who shares your life obliterate it in two minutes and 38 seconds flat (give or take). No matter how happy the dog is, it’s not budget-friendly to spend that kind of money for such a brief period of recreation. That’s why I like teaching dogs to enjoy their toys without destroying them. That may seem an impossible task, but it can be done, and here’s how.\n1. Teach themhowto play with the toy\nEngage your dog in play with the toy. Play fetch,tug, orhide-and-seekwith the toy, or drag it along the floor for your dog to pounce on it. If your dog has fun playing a game with you that involves the toy, they will understand the purpose of the toy. While your dog is still learning the toy is part of a game, put it away when you are done playing. Once they know what the toy is for, they will want to play the game rather than chew and shred the toy. Until they know better, don’t let them make a mistake and destroy it.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\n2. Take toys away strategically\nDon’t set a dog up to fail by leaving them with an errant toy to ruin by chewing it up. Offer the dog the toy, but if they start to shred it, take it away, whether they are picking at it with their teeth or chomping on it with serious biting. Give it right back so they can try again to treat it gently. If they are careful with the toy, let them keep it and offer attention, praise, or play in response to their behavior. Continue to supervise, watching constantly so if they go into destroyer mode, you can immediately take it away.\nYou are teaching your dog that destructive chewing of the toy makes it disappear. If your dog tries three times to destroy the toy, it’s gone for the rest of the day. Some dogs learn to be gentle in just three repetitions, but others require multiple days of this to stop chewing on toys meant for play.\n3. Offer chew toys to satisfy that need\nDogs need to chew — some more than others. They should be allowed to engage in this natural activity, but only with appropriate items. Your veterinarian has the final word onwhich toys are safefor your particular dog, but Chewstix and Nylabones are usually excellent choices, while rawhide is potentially hazardous. Some dogs do great with real bones, cow hooves, antlers, and pig ears, but others risk injury from sharp pieces or splinters.\n4. Make tired time fleece time\nMany dogs find comfort in soft, cuddly, fleece toys. However, they are oh so easy to chew to pieces, which is why most dogs must be taught to snuggle with fleece toys instead of eating them. When your dog is especially tired from a long play session or an extended hike, offer them a fleece toy, as they are most likely to treat it like a teddy bear in this state. If they start to chew on it, take it away, but let them keep it as long as they act tenderly toward it.\n5. Offer multiple toys\nGiving a dog several identical toys can decrease destructive chewing. Give them one toy, and as soon as they become interested in it, offer them a second one, and when they are into that one, toss a third one their way, and maybe even a fourth. This method prevent many dogs from shredding the toys, perhaps by lowering the value of the toys in their eyes.\nEnjoy, don’t destroy\nMany people spend a fortune on toys because their dogs destroy them immediately, and others have stopped giving their dogs toys because “it’s a waste — they chew them up in less than five minutes!” You can avoid being in either category by teaching your dog to enjoy — rather than destroy — their toys.",

Her appetite for eating more than just food — socks, shoes...your couch. Nobody wants their dog to be a picky eater, but youdowant them to be discriminating enough to draw the line at things that are not food, since a) it’s dangerous for dogs to eat socks and other non-food items, and b) it’s a considerable financial strain. Here are some suggestions to minimize both the danger and the expense, and to hopefully stop Lily from eating dangerous items.\nKeep Inedibles Out of Reach\nHelping your dog stay safe (and keeping yourself sane!) will always involve some management. To keep her insides free of items that should remain on the outside, keep her favoriteinediblesout of reach. I’m not suggesting that you Marie Kondo your home to the point that visitors think Lily is the only thing that “sparks joy” for you, but known offenders have to be unattainable. This might be a lot easier said than done.\nA deterrent such as acitrusorbitter applespraymightwork; if it does, feel free to use it (honestly, since they rarely seem to be effective with such eager eaters, I’d be surprised if it did, but would feel irresponsible if I didn’t mention it).\nAdd Stimulation to Your Dog’s Life\nSome dogs develop a habit of swallowing strange things (also known as pica in dogs) out of boredom; a dog looking for something to do often explores with their mouth, and for some, ingestion of the treasure is their next logical step. Adding stimulation to Lily’s life can help with this, so try to add more fun and activity to her days. Consider new activities such asagility,obstacle courses,nosework,more walksor outings, shorttraining sessionsthroughout the day,play sessions, or car rides.\nAnother option is to feed her via sturdyenrichment toys: Dogs need to be able to chew on things that they can’t swallow or that are digestible if they do eat them.Kongtoys in the largest size are a good choice for many dogs. Stuff one with wet food, freeze it, and then give it to her. If she is a voracious eater, talk to your veterinarian first and supervise her whenever she has such an item.\nWhat to do when your dog has questionable tastes.\nUse Reinforcement Training\nWhile it’s not a quick fix,positive reinforcement trainingcan also help. Improving Lily’s response to “drop it” and “leave it” is important so that any possessive behavior (you can’t take it away if it’s in my belly!) doesn’t lead to harm. Start using these cues with items that she is not very excited about and that are too big to be swallowed. Use thetastiest treatsyou can find so it’s worth it to her to do the right thing. Trading up (“give me that mediocre item and I will give you this far better one”) is a great way to improve this behavior.\nAnother training strategy: If seeing you head toward them prompts Lily to swallow things she shouldn’t, instead of chasing her down, encourage her to move away from items that pose a risk. To do this, toss a handful of treats to another spot in the room so she has to get up to get them. Then retrieve the sock while she munches away.\nGive Your Dog More Exercise\nThough it’s not the cure all it is sometimes made out to be, exercise can certainly help. Dogs who are tired and content from a hard effort, preferably off leash (in your yard or other fenced-in area), are less likely to get into whatever trouble they are prone to find, and they are more likely to sleep.\nIf All Else Fails, Hire a Trainer to Help\nI know how hard it can be to keep Lily from eating everything in sight. Hopefully some of these tips work so she can enjoy the world in safe ways from here on out — and you can stop worrying about replacing items she’s chewed up.

  "page_content": "My six-month-old whippet mix is driving me crazy. He has turned from a sweet, quiet pup into a hellion. He now barks at me — probably for attention — and at other dogs (especially at the dog park), and he even nips me during play. Is he trying to dominate me?\nPushy puppies, or dogs who display behavior such as nipping at people or barking at other dogs, are often thought to be displayingdominance, a frequently misunderstood concept. While dominance does exist in a dog’s world, it is not as prevalent as people have been led to believe. Dogs who have not been taught manners or how to play appropriately will often adopt their own behavioral “style” to get attention, and this style is frequently rude and pushy.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nHow to deal with a sassy dog\nAt six months of age, your puppy has entered adolescence, a phase where boundaries are tested and the “crazy” brain takes over. Rather than responding confrontationally, as is easy to do when you don’t understand a behavior, find ways to help your dog make good choices instead of bad ones. At this stage, his puppy brain is like a sponge, absorbing situations and experiences. This makes it the perfect time for positive learning to take place.\nOne of the best ways to teach your pup how to greet and play is by taking him to a puppy socialization and manners class. Manners training will help you understand and communicate with your pup, while socialization with other dogs will teach him how to play appropriately.\nA good class will show you how to teach your puppy a reliable recall, which gives you the opportunity to redirect negative behavior onto atoyortreat. This tells him that leaving play and coming to you are good things. If he ignores you, quietly remove him from the room for a time out until he is calm enough to return to playtime. If he resumes his pushy behavior once he is back in the room, repeat the sequence until he learns that making the right choice means he gets to stay where the fun is.\nThe same method can be used to curb his nipping behavior. If he nips during play with you, either get up and leave the room for a minute or two or have someone else hold his leash while you play, and remove him from the room if he nips you. Play and your attention are rewards for keeping his mouth to himself.\nWhile some dogs thrive on being at thedog park, others find it overwhelming. Observe your pup’s body language to see if he is barking at other dogs because he is overexcited and wants their attention, or because he wants them to stay away from him. Stop taking your dog to the dog park until you understand and address this behavior in class. Practice makes perfect, and rehearsal of negative behavior makes that behavior harder to change.\nChoosing the right dog trainer\nChoose apuppy classthat utilizes positive-reinforcement methods only. Dogs who are trained this way are not only more tolerant and self-controlled, but they also behave more predictably.\nPositive training techniques center on working the dog’s brain in a non-confrontational way, rewarding positive behavior, establishing rituals and predictability, training incompatible behaviors that negate the bad behavior, and lessening a dog’s anger and frustration. Because behavior is influenced without force, the dog’s trust in his person is not violated the way it can be when harsher methods are used (which they unfortunately still are by trainers who espouse outdated dominance and pack-leader theory).\nPositive, however, does not mean permissive, and discipline in the form of vocal interrupters, time outs, or ignoring bad behavior is used to guide the dog into making the right choices rather than suppressing negative behavior through fear or force.",

  "page_content": "Some dog behaviors are super cute: that confused semi-turn of their head when you ask them a question or when they nuzzle into your body on the couch. Other behaviors, though, can be embarrassing and borderline rude — like when your dog tries to smell a stranger’s crotch while you’re out on a walk. Awkward!\nYour instinct might be to suppress this kind of behavior, but it’s important to understand that crotch sniffing is perfectly appropriate indog speak. Dogs are still dogs, even though you consider them part of your family. Understandingwhythey perform certain behaviors (like crotch smelling) will make it easier to know what’s normal and what’s not. Keep reading to learn what to do about a crotch-sniffing dog.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nBorn to Sniff\nAs a canine behaviorist and trainer, one of the questions I am asked frequently is “How can I stop my dog from sniffing everyone’s crotch?” As with all behavior modification, the key is to understand the root cause of the issue.\nA dog’s most dominant sense is their sense of smell, and sniffing is one of their most natural behaviors. With a scent sensitivity many thousands of times greater than our own, dogs have a specialized structure within their nasal cavity called the olfactory recess. This maze of airways allows dogs to sniff odors that are undetectable to us. Dogs have 125 to 300 million olfactory cells (compared to our mere 5 million), and 33% of their brain is dedicated to interpreting odors.\nResearch by scientists at Pennsylvania State University showed that dogs have the incredible ability to take a different odor into each nostril and analyze it. They are a species of superior sniffers. Dogs make sense of the world through scents, much in the same way that people rely heavily on vision.\nWhy Do Dogs Smell Your Crotch?\nFirst, it helps to understandthe reason that dogs sniff each other’s bums: Dogs have pouches located on either side of the sphincter calledanal glandsor anal sacs. They are lined with oils and sweat glands, and they release an odor that is unique to each dog. When dogs take in the scent produced by these glands, they are able to gather a lot of information about the other dog including sex, age, health, mood, and wellbeing.\nIf we transfer that to humans, our sweat glands and the scent they produce is often most concentrated around our genital areas and armpits. As most dogs cannot easily reach up to our armpits, the crotch is the go-to area to get the information they need on a new person.\nTo a dog, crotch sniffing is not bad manners. Dogs have no idea that placing their noses into the crouch of a human is not socially acceptable. We need to teach them that when it comes to people, we would prefer an alternative method to get to know each other.\nHow to Put a Stop to Crotch Sniffing\nIt can be relatively easy to squash this behavior with consistency and heavily rewarding your dog when they choose not to smell someone’s crotch. While you can’t train out the innate behavior, itcanbe redirected. The key to training away unwanted crotch sniffing is to offer an alternative region for your dog to gather the information they want and gently block the current go-to area. Each time your dog attempts to crotch sniff, follows these simple steps:\nGive a clear instruction to stop and if necessary, include a previously learned command such as “wait.” For example: “No Rover, wait” or “No, Rover, look at me.”\nGive a clear instruction to stop and if necessary, include a previously learned command such as “wait.” For example: “No Rover, wait” or “No, Rover, look at me.”\nOffer a hand slowly and palm up for inspection, while turning the crotch away or blocking it with something. This area of the hand also carries a lot of sweat glands and can be sufficient to gather the information they need to satisfy them.\nOffer a hand slowly and palm up for inspection, while turning the crotch away or blocking it with something.

Timing, as always, is key. Give them enough time to sniff and then immediately offer the treat.\nIf you have a more insistent dog, start with placing your dog on a leash. If they are trying to get to the crotch and will not accept the hand being offered, stand still, keeping them back. Do not yank them back. The only pressure being applied on the leash should come from your dog. Allow them to calm down a little. Maybe walk them around and retry, showing them a hand when returning to the visitor.\nIf they get to a crotch before you can prevent them, the owner of the crotch should gently push them away while turning. Once you have control of your dog, repeat by offering the hand and rewarding your dog’s decision to sniff that instead. The idea is to show your dog how you want them to behave. When your dog sniffs hands instead of crotches, always give them a signal that this is the right thing to do (say “good dog” or ”yes”). Most dogs understand within a few months that hand sniffing is more socially acceptable than crotch sniffing and that it will result in special praise from you or a tasty treat. After some time consistently training this, hand sniffing becomes conditioned over crotch-sniffing.\nIt’s best to start this training at home, using family and visitors to practice on. Setting a dog up for success in a controlled environment where you are unlikely to feel pressure or embarrassment goes a long way to change their behavior long-term.",

    "title": "How to Break Up a Dog Fight",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/breaking-dog-fight-risky"
  },
  "page_content": "When you see dogs at risk of hurting one another, it’s natural (and commendable) to want to step in and halt the madness as soon as possible — especially when they are both your dogs. But for your sake and theirs, it’s important to be prepared before you step in.\nWhat are the signs of a potential dog fight?\n“A hard stare is one of thosesubtle signalsthat’s often missed by humans, but not by other dogs. A hard stare can easily trigger a fight,” says professional canine behavior specialist and Certified Professional Dog Trainer Nicole Wilde. Pet parents might even misunderstand which dog actually started a fight, if they missed that initial stare.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\n“Another small signal that is sometimes missed is a raised lip… sometimes a dog will display a subtler version, such as a slightly raised and trembling corner of the lip,” says Wilde. Then there’s more obvious body language like a stiff body,growling, lip-licking, yawning, scratching, sniffing, averting the eyes or turning away from the other dog.\nHere are three ways to break up a dog fight:\nThere is no surefire way to break up a fight between dogs, and there is no guarantee that it can be done safely. There are always risks, but some techniques for breaking up a dog fight are better bets than others — and depending on the seriousness of the dog fight, you may be willing to take a big risk. If you ever have the misfortune of seeing dogs fighting (rather thanjust playing roughly) with each other, consider your options and choose what you think is the best way to handle the situation.\nDistraction is low risk; it’s not always effective, but it isn’t likely to cause a problem, either.\nSudden loud noises\nOne option to break up a dog fight is making a loud sound such banging any loud metal objects together or blowing an air horn. Dogs often ignore these attempts, but for dogs who are not that committed to the fight — or who actually want tostopfighting but can’t seem to break it off themselves — loud startling sounds can work.\nSudden spray\nThis method is pretty hit-or-miss. It’s true that spraying dogs with a hose may stop a dog fight, but dogs so rarely fight within reach of one. I’ve heard of cases in which fighting dogs were pushed in a pool and stopped, but again, there’s not always a pool handy when you need one. If spraying them with water isn’t an option, dumping a bucket of water over them can break up a dog fight, but some dogs don’t seem to care. Spraying dogs with a citronella spray can have the same effect as water.\n2. Separation\nBreaking up a dog fight with direct physical contact has the best chance of stopping the fight, but it also poses the biggest risk of you being bitten.\nBarriers\nUsing a barrier to break up a dog fight is riskier than the above distraction suggestions, but also more likely to work. Inserting a cookie sheet, a piece of plywood, or even a thick piece of poster board between two dogs can break up a fight.\nThe bigger the barrier, the lower the risk of being bitten, because you can keep your hands further away from the mouths of the dogs. It’s wise to lower that probability any way that you can. That said, it’s a major feat of coordination to accomplish this during a highly active altercation, especially at adog park. It’s best to call your dog away before the fighting starts.\nWheel barrow method\nIf two people are there, an option is for each person to grab the back legs of a dog and pull them away from each other. Yes, it can work, and yes, it’s awkward to time this right.\nDogs have almost no power when their back legs are not in contact with the ground, which is why this is not likely to lead to a bite to the people. Of course, a failed attempt in which one dog is being held and the other gets away can put everybody at risk. I’ve seen people separate dogs by grabbing tails instead of hind legs. It’s not very pleasant for the dogs, but it’s generally better than continuing to fight.\nDogo\nOur friends at Dogo are like the Jedi Masters of dog training. Check out their programs to teach your dog literally 100+ tricks. Or just master “sit.” Either works.\n3. Last Resort\nThe worst and riskiest ways to break up a dog fight involve putting your hand near their front ends. That includes grabbing at collars and reaching for an object that is the source of the dispute.\nBreaking up a dog fight with your hands (or other body part) so often leads to dogs turning and biting at people’s hands, but it’s only fair to point out that reaching into the middle of a dog fight is most people’s natural response to trying to stop it. And though reaching in is risky, if a dog’s life appears to be in danger, it may be worth doing anyway.\nWhen The Fight Ends\nOnce your break up the dog fight, the next step is to read body language. You’ll want to understand why a fight occurred instead of just assuming it was a fluke or hoping the same type of situation won’t occur again. A majority of the dog aggression behavior cases involving bites that I treat have a history of getting into low level spats which over time developed into more dangerous fights. Many fights can be prevented simply by noticing when one dog is tense around another and calling the two dogs apart before there’s trouble and then rewarding your dog for good behavior.",

    "title": "Tips on Managing a Multi-Dog Household",

  "page_content": "Have you ever consideredgetting a second dog? How about a third dog? What about more? You aren’t alone. It’s hard to resist the allure of those cute scruffy faces. On a typical morning in a multi-dog household, you’re bound to see dogs romping around — playing, zooming, and rolling all in the course of an hour — it’s hard to imagine a better way to start the day.\nHaving a multi-dog household (three or more dogs) means three playmates instead of one and three dogs to comfort you when you’re down. With three, you’re more likely to have a snuggly companion on the couch or bed, and you’ll be welcomed home by three madly wagging tails. And living in a multi-dog household is also better for your dog. For one thing, you’re not solely responsible for their entertainment. They wear each other out when they play in a way that’s impossible for you to replicate.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nDespite the manybenefits of multi-dog homes, there are also costs, and they’re not all financial. Wiping 12 muddy paws or trimming 54 toenails is exponentially more tiresome than dealing with four paws or 18 nails. Walking three leashed dogs can be complicated, especially when your leashes get tangled with those attached to several dogs from another household. And, of course, training three or more dogs is harder than training one or even two, especially when it involves behaviors they tend to do in unison, like barking at the UPS man or rushing to the door when the bell rings. For many people, such training requires more time and patience than they have.\nDealing with aggression in a multi-dog household\nDogs don’t always get along, of course. Although a lot of “aggression” between familiar dogs is ritualized andharmless without biting, it sometimes escalates, especially when a new dog is involved. While researchers have not systematically observed multiple pet dogs living together, a few studies have examined data from canine behaviorists who had been consulted for help with intra-household aggression. Unfortunately, these studies do not involve a comparison group of households whose dogs do get along, which makes many of their findings hard to interpret. Nevertheless, they tend to agree on a few patterns: aggression is often instigated by a newly matured dog or by a new household member against an older dog, is more frequent within same-sex pairs, particularly when both dogs are female.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nAside from avoiding the most common triggers — such asresource guardingin the presence of food or toys; proximity to the pet parent; high-arousal situations, such asgreetingsor preparations to leave; and being together in a confined space, such as a narrow hallway — other treatment recommendations include medications such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and following a “nothing in life is free” program.\nSome canine behaviorists encourage people to consistently favor one dog over the others (e.g., the older or higher-ranking dog) by giving them resources and attention first. Behaviorist Patricia McConnell argues against this because, in her experience, it doesn’t work. She suggests other methods of decreasing intra-household aggression, including training dogs to be in close proximity to one another while waiting in turn for a resource.\nIn one example of dogs highly trained in this method, McConnell asks three Border Collies and a Great Pyrenees to line up, then kneels in front of them holding a pan in which meat has been roasted. By name, she calls one dog forward to lick the pan, then asks that dog to stop licking and back up when it is the next dog’s turn. Her dogs’ body language indicates how muchself-controlthey must exert to succeed in this situation, but succeed they do. The lesson? When dogs learn that they get what they want by politely waiting their turn, they are less likely to bully each other (or you!) as a way to gain resources.\nWhen intra-household aggression is a serious problem, consult a certified canine behaviorist with a background in this type of situation. In addition, it can be very helpful to learn as much as possible aboutcanine communicationto better understand dogs’ interactions. For example, being tuned in to postures and facial expressions that often precede aggression — such as a dog standing very still with his muzzle tightly closed — can allow us to intervene before an attack is launched.\nWho is the leader of the pack?\nMore often than not, multiple dogs do get along. Based on my own experience, I hypothesize that relationships between a household’s humans and dogs, as well as relationships among the humans, influence how dogs get along. People who model peaceful, generous, and courteous behavior create a household culture that dogs, who are highly attuned to social etiquette, recognize. Puppies growing up in such households are especially likely to adopt that culture.\nOne of my favorite group activities involves walking my dogs off-leash in wild areas far from roads. Each dog understands that when I say, for example, “Max, lead!” I will follow the dog who has been singled out so long as they don’t move toward anything dangerous. All my dogs love being the leader yet will relinquish that role when it’s the next dog’s turn — or mine. It’s fascinating to see where each dog chooses to go; their noses lead us to places I might never find. Also, I can relax because I’m not making all the decisions; it’s fun to be a follower for a change. Finally, letting the dogs be in charge helps balance power in the human-dog relationship. None of my dogs has mutinied, which I think effectively demonstrates that we don’t always have to be “the decider” to have well-behaved dogs.\nBased on what scientists know about people, dogs, and their mutual histories, these outings in some ways mimic the original relationship between human hunter-gatherers and canines. Hunters traveled with multiple dogs, some of whom tracked and chased game while others protected women and children when they were out foraging. Since dogs can smell and hear better than we can, as well as see better in the dark, it made sense for our ancestors to sometimes defer to canine judgments about where to go (or not go). Most of the time, you can’t live this way, but you can get a taste of the wild by going on long outings and allowing your dogs to lead.\nRelationship dynamics of multiple dogs\nAnother plus to living with multiple dogs is the opportunity to observe relationship dynamics. Groups of dogs are systems, which means that if any part changes, everything else changes as well. Through such observations, I’ve learned that dogs take their relationships with one another seriously. Old friends whose interest in playing together gradually decreased over the years may be energized when a new dog joins the family, and in turn, they may spend more time playing with one another.\nSeveral years ago, I lived with three female dogs; at one point, they were joined by Osa, a middle-aged male who needed a temporary home. Safi, the undisputed lead dog in my group, had known Osa well five years earlier, and they began playing almost immediately.\nHowever, Safi was by then older and weaker than Osa, and she objected to some of hisrough playmoves. After clearly communicating this several times, she lost patience and moved to discipline him. Instead of submitting, Osa grabbed Safi’s neck and briefly forced her to the ground. Less than a minute later, Safi approached Osa to reconcile (more about this behavior follows), but he ignored her. From that moment on, Safi gave Osa the cold shoulder, refusing to interact with him in any way. The other two females, who had merely witnessed the event, also ceased engaging with Osa, even though both had played with him before. To my amazement, all three females ostracized Osa during the rest of his stay, a full seven weeks. I was reminded of situations in human families in which people refuse to speak to one another for years.\nWatch for reconciliation among dogs\nI urge people who live with several dogs to pay attention to their interactions. One thing to look for is reconciliation behavior. Research shows that shortly after a two-way conflict within their group, dogs and wolves tend to approach the former opponent to do something nice, like touch muzzles or invite play. Dogs and wolves are especially likely to reconcile when they place a high value on a relationship, and “making up” can be a window into their feelings. For example, a dog that sometimes gets grumpy when playing may, a few moments later, offer a muzzle lick. The same study documenting reconciliation in dogs also showed that if the combative parties fail to reconcile shortly afterward, a third dog, uninvolved in the event, is likely to approach the “victim” of the squabble in a friendly manner, perhaps to offer comfort.\nNotice, also, the way dogs who live in the same household behave when they meet another dog. Many times, I have seen them close ranks when an unfamiliar dog exhibits the slightest unfriendly move toward one of their own. If that behavior escalates to a real threat or fight, a dog may intervene directly to defend a housemate. Such defense is particularly striking when a dog supports someone they don’t especially like when they’re at home.\nBecause we’re humans, we focus on our dogs’ relationships with us. But the most amazing thing about dogs is their capacity to become integrated into both human and canine society. In the past, dogs usually lived in multi-dog, multi-human groups. Multi-dog households are, in a sense, their birthright. No matter how much we love our dogs, to be fulfilled, we need other people, and no matter how much dogs love us, they need other dogs to experience and express all of who they are.",

  "page_content": "I have two dogs who used to get along so well. Lately, instead of being his usual sweet self, the younger one has become pushy with my nine-year-old senior dog, and it seems to be getting worse. After three years of harmony, why is my younger dog so rude to her, and will he grow out of it?\nA family is a dynamic social unit, and interactions between members change—a truism that holds for most, if not all, social species, including dogs. While it can be surprising for many pet parents to see such ashift in a relationshipthat used to be so smooth—it’s actually pretty common. Here are five reasons why your dogs may have stopped getting along.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\n1. They’re at different ages…\nYounger dogs who’ve been respectful to older dogs often start to assert themselves as they mature and become more confident. Your older dog is likely entering her golden years—even if she’s healthy—she’s probably a little slower, a little less active and perhaps a little quicker to tire. On the other hand, your younger dog is entering the prime of his life—maturing into his full adult status.\nA dog’sdevelopmental stagematters because age is a fundamentally important part of how dogs treat each other and get along. Young adults through middle-aged dogs are usually on the receiving end of deferential behavior from other dogs. This is a huge generalization, and of course, there are tons of exceptions based on individual personalities but on the face of it, your dogs certainly fit the general pattern. Your younger dog is demanding more respect and offering less, while your older dog is not able to command the respect she once did.\n2. They might be resource guarding…\nResource guarding is one of the “usual suspects” when dogs in a household have issues with eachother.Asdogs grow from adolescence to young adulthood, it’s common for them to have an inclination to hoard things or defend treasures. Ifresource guardingis the issue, as the younger dog develops possessiveness issues, he may no longer be willing to defer to the older dog — even if he was previously respectful. Challenges over resources are common, and while his behavior is going to appear disrespectful, he’s actually just asserting his own interests.\n3. The younger dog may just be over it…\nThe younger dog may be saying, “Enough already!” Sometimes, what looks like a younger dog being disrespectful is not what it appears. Your younger dog may be acting less respectful because your older dog has been controlling everything, and the younger one isn’t having it anymore. It’s not unusual for a younger dog to decide that enough is enough with an older dog who’s not been sharing. When the younger dog rejects the older dog’s privilege (as it were), it can appear that the younger dog is being disrespectful, but it’s really quite reasonable for him to stop his across-the-board deference.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\n4. They have conflicting personalities…\nIndividual personalities influence how (and if) this age-related dynamic playsout.It’spretty common to see dogs who are two to three years old behaving less respectfully to dogs in their household as they get older, especially towards dogs age seven or more. However, personality also plays a role. Like humans, dogs’ personalities likely change over time. Maybe one dog likes to wrestle, and the other doesn’t. Some dogs may be more interested in toys, food, space, attention, or any number of things, while others are wholly unconcerned. If your dog has a strong interest in something, he is likely to assert himself — it’s part of thenatural canine social order.\n5. There could be a health problem…\nThen there are all the age-related physical problems that can impact an older dog’s relationships. Whether thepain and discomfortcomes from conditions likearthritis, hip dysplasia, orjoint stiffness, dogs with physical issues may be irritable or short-tempered. Compounding the problem, those physical issues can result in a lack of sleep for the older dog, which will add to their irritability. An irritable older dog may not be as sweet and kind as usual, making them seem unpredictable or even scary to a younger dog. It’s only natural that the younger dog acts differently in response, and that can mean behaving less deferentially and more assertively.\nAge-related mobility, vision, and hearing problems can also contribute to the deterioration of a previously harmonious relationship. A dog with such issues may not be able to communicate clearly with body language or may not respond appropriately to the younger dog because of an inability to see or hear that dog’s signals. Miscommunication can lead to both confusion and anxiety for the younger dog and they might respond with behavior that seems downright rude.\nThey won’t grow out of it.\nSo now that you know why your dogs aren’t getting along anymore, what’s next? Well, their relationship is going to keep changing. Don’t hitch your wagon to the idea that your dog will grow out of it. Your younger dog will continue to mature, and your older dog will continue to age, so this change in the dynamic between the two of them is unlikely to be temporary.

  "page_content": "Dear Neighbors Who Walk Their Dog Without a Leash,\nHi! I’m the guy with the tan Pit Bull mix named Rufus. I want to take a moment to ask you to please walk your dog with a leash.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nLook, I get it. Your dog is amazing and well-trained. You’ve been through extensive training and your dog knows a slew of verbal commands. Your dog is a service animal and visits children’s cancer wards and retirement communities and is the best-behaved dog you’ve ever had. I get it.\nBut here's the thing: While you may be 100 percent convinced that your dog won't do anything spontaneous or harmful, at the end of the day, your dog is an animal who may react instinctively — even if they're super well-trained. Sure, it's possible that they won't cause harm, but there's just no way to know for sure.\nGet your fix of Kinship\nWe promise not to send you garbage that turns your inbox into a litter box.

So, he’s not good with other dogs. He loves people and tolerates children but he doesn’t like other dogs (oh and then there's squirrels...he hates squirrels).\nYou may have noticed that we cross the street when we see another dog. And while I've done my best to train Rufus to ignore other dogs, if your dog starts barking, he'll respond. And if your dog isn't leashed and comes running toward us, Rufus will react. And my fear is that would be bad — potentially very bad.\nPart of the problem is there's still a stigma around Pit Bulls like Rufus (personally, I think breed specific bias andlegislationis deplorable). But the bias exists and that's why I've trained Rufus to be a responsible canine citizen — and I consider myself a responsible pet parent who uses a leash. I’m unwilling to put my dog, or yours, in a position where they feel threatened and need to call upon their instincts.\nTo be fair, I was once like you. I used to have a dog who I walked without a leash. When confronted, I defended my dog like you do, saying “He won’t do anything,” “He’s friendly,” and my personal favorite: “Relax.” (When has anything good ever come from someone telling a stressed person to relax?) Looking back, I’m ashamed of my behavior. I was wrong.\nSo neighbor, please take this letter under consideration. The benefits of keeping your dog on a leash far outweigh the drawbacks. Thanks for reading.\nSee you on the sidewalk,\nKeith & Rufus",

  "page_content": "Puppies acquired during lockdown have been missing out on critical socialization experiences and training, which is known to be associated with stress-induced behaviors ranging fromnervousness to fear-based aggression.\nPeople around the world have been spending more time at home since the start of 2020. For many of these people, this seemed like the perfect opportunity to get a pet. In the UK alone, an estimated3.2 million householdshave acquired a pet since the start of the pandemic. Dogs were the most popular new acquisition (57%), with cats a close second (38%). This sudden increase in pet ownership raises concerns about pet welfare.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nIt isn’t just the pandemic pets that may be showing signs of stress or behavioral issues. Life hasn’t been normal for many dogs for most of the past few years. They’ve had less interaction with other dogs, fewer visitors coming into the home, and little time alone since the pandemic began.\nFewer interactions have caused more stress.\nThis has led to a noticeable change in dog behavior.Growling, snapping or nippingchildren when approached and handled by them increased by 57% during the lockdown. Google searches for “dog bark” and “dog bite” increased by 48% and 40%, respectively, suggesting some aspects of the lockdown period were particularly challenging for our pets.\nHey, man. It’s all about those chemical messengers. See how Adaptil can help your pup.\nAs humans, we tend to focus on situational stress — work deadlines, or paying bills. But stress can be caused by anything that upsets the body’s hormone balances. The presence of stressor results in a hormone cascade, culminating in the release of glucose that provides a burst of energy designed to help escape the stressor. This sets off the fight, flight or freeze response.\nStressors range from a physical threat, such as a predator, to an unpredictable environment, which our pets might be experiencing now lockdown restrictions ease. This isn’t limited to dogs. Changes to routine, particularly feeding schedule, have been shown to inducestress in cats, birds,sheepandhorses.\nIs your dog stressed?\nSigns of stress in your dog may be obvious, such as destructive behavior or vocalizing. But, there are also more subtle signs of stress in dogs, such as panting or drooling, pacing, repeatedly checking windows and doors, or chewing or scratching themselves.\nLockdown may, unfortunately, have a long-term impact on pets’ ability to cope when left home alone. Dogs that had separation anxiety before the restrictions started are likely to get worse when left again as owners head back to work. But we also expect to see new cases developing, because other dogs, and particularly puppies, have learned to expect company all day.\nResearch last yearshowed that 82% of pet parents surveyed noticed an increase in their dog whining or barking when a household member was busy. There was a 41% increase in reports of dogs being clingy or following people around the house during the lockdown. All of these can be indicators of separation anxiety developing.\nHow to help a stressed dog:\nThe good news is, it’s not too late to prepare your dog and to teach them vital skills that they can apply in any situation. If you’re starting to spend more time outside of the house, you need to remember that this change in routine is stressful for your pets. Start preventative measures now to avoid future problems.\nIf you have a dog who was previously used to being left alone, make sure you maintain their ability to cope with this by introducing periods of separation during the day when you are in the house – such as placing them behind a baby gate whilst you are working from home. Leave your dog at home for short periods of time.\nTrain your dog to stay calm when they’re on their own — instead of sad-singing“All By Myself”until you come home.\nBuild up the amount of time your dog is separated from family members gradually and associate it with something positive, such as a long-lasting treat. Monitor how your dog responds, and shorten the time left if they show any signs of anxiety.\nWhere dogs are already showing signs of separation anxiety (such as barking, howling, toileting, or being destructive when left), seek help from your vet in the first instance. Avoid looking for “quick fix” solutions like anti-bark collars or punishing your dog on return. These approaches will likely exacerbate the problem and result in more serious and more difficult-to-treat problems in the long run.\nTeaching dogs to be relaxed when left takes time and patience, particularly for the pandemic puppies that have rarely been away from their pet parents. But making the effort to show your dog that being alone is not stressful, using our advice, can prevent serious problems that are much more difficult to treat later in life.\nThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

  },
  "page_content": "It begins with your dog’s body becoming tense, their ears stand up, and they are staring straight ahead at their worst fear. Coming your direction is a hound roughly four times their size that is clearly eager to investigate your pup, andtheir person appears just as eager to allow them to.\nSure, their dog is friendly, but the problem in this scenario is that your dog — and many other leash reactive dogs like them — has no, zilch, notta single interest in meeting the hound.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nLeash reactivityis when a dog is barking, lunging, and/or growling while on leash in response to the presence of a particular stimulus. When exposed to something that frightens them, such as another dog, these dogs will do their best to send the message that they aren’t ok. You might see a dog pulling on their leash as forcefully as possible and barking ferociously. Putting their behavior into words, I imagine them saying, “Uh-uh! You need to stay away from me! Keep your distance! I said,get the hell away!”\nOften this type of behavior is embarrassing for the pet parents on the other end of the leash. You might even find yourself apologizing for the behavior. However, as a dog trainer with an education in dog behavior and because of years of experience working with dogs, I don’t blame the dog fortheir behaviorone little bit.\nFiguring out why your dog lunges at other dogs.\nIn one training session, my client Rocket, a scrappy terrier mix, no more than 15 pounds, did his very best to prevent a situation that made him feel powerless, uncertain and downright fearful. Yet, Rocket’s worst fears were brought to life as he was on a leash, trapped and unable to stop a much larger dog from doing exactly as he pleased. And unfortunately, Rocket’s pet parent wasn’t having it. She wasembarrassedand frustrated.\nDon’t blame the dog — instead, figure out how to help them succeed.\nBut I explained to her that dogs like Rocket don’t seek opportunities to embarrass their pet parents. He is using thelanguagehe speaks to communicate to other dogs that he does not want to mingle. Again, this could be because he doesn’t like the sensation of being trapped. He may be motivated by an event in his past, perhaps involving a fight. He may simply prefer to have space between him and other dogs. (I’m sure many of us can relate — do you love inspecting your co-worker’s facial pores as he invades your personal space every time you interact?) What Rocket’s behavior should communicate to other dogs is not always respected by other dogs, or other humans, for that matter.\nHow to respond to a dog lunging or barking on leash.\nSo, what is my approach? How do I help the Rockets of this world learn to deal with things that scare them? I decipher their loudly shouted messages, share them with their people, and build each dog’s trust in their people. I create a bridge of communication between human and dog. All of these approaches allow the Rockets to relax a little more with every walk and, consequently, allow their people to relax, too. No need for embarrassment or overwhelming fear. Let’s break down this approach.\nHow do you get the messages your dog is sharing? You need to better understand their body language and their “spoken” language, as well. This can be tough, but many great resources on canine language exist;here’s a good place to start.I’m partial, both from a scientific and ethical perspective to positive reinforcement.\nHow do you build trust between you and your dog? It starts by learning to recognize what your dog is saying, which makes it easier to respond appropriately. Once you identify their fear and your dog’s inability to handle close proximity to another dog or human, it allows you to understand that putting distance between a dog and their feared stimuli providesreassurance. Visual barriers can also calm or soothe a fearful dog.\nWith patience and positive reinforcement, you can do a lot to make up for lost time with socialization.\nNext, and my favorite, how do you build a bridge of communication with a member of another species? One option is to create a shared language; to do this, you train. My training cue of choice for lunging dogs is a form of focus called “look” or “watch.” With proper education and lots of practice, you can ask forattentionfrom your dog as the two of you enter a questionable situation. Asking for focus helps prevent further reactions from the dog. If, thanks to shared communication and distraction techniques, the situation never becomes too frightening, there is no need for the Rocket of this scenario to lunge or send a loud, barking message.\nIt gets better.\nHere’s the best part: at some point, you may not even need to ask for your dog’s focus. With practice, your dog may choose to handle the situation themself by looking at you (rather than lunge or bark) when they encounter a worrisome situation. Let me tell you, this is an exhilarating moment the first time it happens. Even though I’ve seen it hundreds of times, I still want to leap into the air with excitement.\nAs pet parents who have chosen to bring another species into your daily lives, you have an obligation to try to understand what your dogs are telling you. Likewise, you have an obligation to try to improve your relationship using this acquired knowledge.\nThere’s no need to feel embarrassed. Have a “chat” with your dog, and rediscover that walks with your best friend really are one of the best parts of your day.",

  },
  "page_content": "Having worked for many years with aggressive dogs, I’ve shared the pain with a number of families facing the difficult decision of whether or not to euthanize a dog because of serious aggression. On multiple occasions, I’ve cried with them (and in private) over the pain suffered in these challenging situations. But I believe euthanasia should only be an option in extreme cases.\nWhen should an aggressive dog be euthanized?\nWhen I say “extreme” cases, I mean clients who can never take a vacation because nobody else can safely care for their dog, and people whose marriages have ended because of the dog. I include the client who told me that when his dog bit him on the neck multiple times in quick succession, his wife was concerned about the amount of blood he had lost. She rushed him to the ER so he could get a blood transfusion that likely saved his life. On another occasion, this same dog bit the wife multiple times, breaking her arm and several bones in her wrist and hand. She required surgery because of the injuries. I include people who live every day in fear that something will go wrong (a broken leash, a door left open by mistake, an unplanned guest), and the result will be that someone gets hurt and their legal liability will destroy their lives.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nA factor that makes the decision about whether or not to euthanize even more challenging is the judgment of other people. Some who are critical may simply say that they personally wouldnevereuthanize a dog. Others have moral conflicts with deciding to end the life of a pet, no matter what the reason. I understand these objections, but it is heartbreaking for me to see my clients suffer not only the agony of the decision, but the criticism of others.\nGet your fix of Kinship\nWe promise not to send you garbage that turns your inbox into a litter box.

They are dealing with unbelievably tough circumstances and I have great sympathy for those facing the awful decision about whether or not to euthanize an aggressive dog. That’s why I was so pleased to see anarticlewritten by my mentor and friend, Dr. Patricia McConnell, Ph.D., titled “When Is It Time to Put Down a Dog Who is Aggressive to People?”\nThe perspective that this decision is highly personal had me nodding and saying, “Yes!” out loud. Families should make these decisions, and individual decisions are informed by an assessment of risk and people’s different tolerances for risk. I completely agree that euthanasia shouldonlybe considered if placing the dog in a different home or managing and modifying the behavior are not possible. Members of both species — people and pet — deserve to have their quality of life considered as an important part of the decision-making process.\nAre there alternatives?\nI advise anyone to consider all options before making such a huge decision. Anyone who comes to the heartbreaking decision to euthanize an aggressive dog deserves to feel confident they exhausted all other possibilities so they can be at peace with their choice. Many dogs who are aggressive respond well to behavior modification and training. Others can be managed to avoid the situations that lead to trouble. Some dogs may only be aggressive around children, so placing them in an adults-only home may make managing the situation possible.\nHowever, there are dogs who are aggressive in many contexts, are unpredictable, do not respond sufficiently to behavior modification, do not inhibit their bites, and have a history of causing serious injury. The result is a level of risk and damage to the quality of life for everyone involved that make euthanasia a reasonable option. Extreme cases are rare, but the people whose dogs are those extreme cases deserve our sympathy, not our disdain. It’s a very personal decision and I want everyone facing it to be able to do so without facing criticism from other people.",

  "page_content": "The local dog park is a short drive from your house, and you usually take your dog there before doing other errands. Within a few minutes of leaving the house, they start whining in the backseat, which is not only distracting, but also incredibly annoying. Which makes you wonder: Can you train your dog to stop whining in the car on the way to the dog park? The short answer: Yes! Here are some ways to make the car ride better for both of you.\nWhat To Do About a Dog Who Whines in the Car\nThe root of the problem is that they knows where you’re going and cannot contain their enthusiasm. The solution? Make it harder for them to figure out the destination and easier for them to remain calm in the car. To do that, it’s important to become less predictable — to reduce their expectation that a ride in the car means they’re going to the dog park.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nTake your dog on car rides regularly so that going out in the car isn’t so closely linked with a visit to their playground. Add to the unpredictability by varying the order of your stops; for example, errands might come before or after the dog park, or both. Sometimes a car ride may be just errands, and sometimes it may just be a joy ride without any stops at all. Your dog may still get revved up when you get close to the dog park on the days you actually go there, but hopefully it will be for a couple of minutes rather than the entire ride.\nTo make arrivals at the dog park less exciting for your pup, park at a distance and walk to the park from your parking spot. Once in a while, park in that spot and go for a walkwithoutvisiting the dog park. That way, in a sense, you’re never actually driving to the dog park — you’re driving to a parking spot, which may mean a walk or may mean some off-leash fun.\nIf your dog is never sure when they’re in the car that you’re going to the dog park, the annoying behavior associated with their anticipation will be less likely to happen. (To be honest, your walk may be filled with her excitement, but that's not as problematic as whining in the car.)\nNo matter where you’re headed, help your dog be their best self in the car by giving them something to keep them occupied. Whether it’s a stuffedKong, afood puzzle, or a chew toy, if your dog likes it and it holds their attention, they’re less likely to whine and drive you crazy.",

  },
  "page_content": "It’s so cliche, you almost can’t believe it’s real: your dog furiously barking at the mail carrier every time you haveanotherAmazon package delivered (so twice a day). In addition to being concerned about the mail carrier’s well-being — and the future state of your Amazon deliveries — you’d like your pup to stop freaking the eff out every time they see a FedEx or UPS truck.\nIf it’s any consolation, your dog is in good company with this reaction. It’s so common that the image of adog barkingand charging a mail carrier (who’s very worried about protecting the seat of his pants) is a comic trope. But there’s nothing funny about it if it’s your dog — or if you’re the mail carrier!\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nIt's a serious matter especially due to the potential for dog bites: The Postal Service even released a report titled “Postal Service Announces Top Dog Attack Cities” which shares the statistic that 5,714 postal employees were attacked by dogs in 2018 across the United States. Houston was the city in which the most such bites occurred followed by Los Angeles and Philadelphia.\nWhy Do Dogs Bark Or Bite Postal Workers?\nFor some dogs, the original barking is motivated by fear, while for others, it’s a territorial response. Still other dogs lose control because the mail carrier’s repeated appearances bring on a state of high arousal. The crazed behavior can even be the result of frustration; some social dogs want nothing more than to make a new buddy, but are continually thwarted by doors or gates or other barriers to contact.\nIt’s normal for a dog to bark to alert their social group to anyone approaching the house. What makes dog barking tricky is that from a dog’s point of view, the mail carrier is a repeat offender who keeps coming onto their turf. Dogs rarely meet and get to know this individual, yet the mail carrier comes onto the property over and over again. What begins as an alerting behavior can morph into wanting-to-eat-the-mail-carrier displays as the dog learns that they bark and he goes away. To us, that looks like two separate things, but to dogs, it looks like success:I bark, he leaves. Dogs learn very quickly that barking will make the intruder go away.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nThe situation can become more serious when the dog acts this way around mail carriers in other contexts. Some dogs learn to associate specific traits with negative feelings about the individual, and react whenever those triggers are present. Then you’ve got a dog who barks around anyone who looks like the mail carrier, or who’s dressed in a similar way. Some dogs generalize to people who smell the same, perhaps from scents inside the truck, a type of shampoo or deodorant, or a cologne. For other pups, any person carrying parcels and papers is treated like a mail carrier.\nGeneralizing happens with the truck, too. While some dogs distinguish between the mail truck and any other truck, others begin to bark at all trucks. Lots of dogs learn that the mail truck always stops at their house, but the UPS and the FedEx trucks usually drive by.\nThe majority of dogs who bite do so because they are afraid. Fearful dogs are often especially scared of people who are carrying things, which puts people who deliver the mail at risk. Furthermore, these mail carriers turn their backs and walk away, an action that can give frightened dogs just enough confidence to act on their fears by biting.\nTo both fearful and territorial dogs (as well as dogs with both issues), uniforms are often associated with unfamiliar people arriving on their property, so the uniform itself can be a trigger that elicits aggressive behavior.\nNo matter why your dog is acting in this manner, there are things you can do to improve the dog barking and help your dog (and the mail carrier) have better experiences when around each other.\nHow To Stop Excessive Dog Barking\nPrevent your dog from engaging in the problematic behavior.\nIf it has become a habit, you need to break the habit — and that means avoiding the problem so your dog doesn’t have yet another experience in which they successfully bark at the mail carrier on his way.\nWhether you keep your dog in a part of the house where they can’t see the mail being delivered, or cover your windows with poster board to block their view, simple preventive actions will go a long way toward helping them overcome this.\nTeach your dog a new response based on a new emotional reaction. If your dog is upset — fearful or irritated by the sight of the postal worker — they will continue to react by barking and growling. So, it’s critical to help your dog change the way they feel about the situation. That can be done by teaching your dog that every time a mail carrier or a mail truck shows up, they get their favorite thing. For most dogs, that favorite item is eithertreats(perhaps stuffed in aKongfor longer-lasting enjoyment) or a toy such as a tennis ball, squeaky fleece animal, or a rope toy.\nIf the mail carrier is willing, ask him to toss your pup the treats or a toy, since that’s the best way for them to learn to associate him with good things. Just be aware that while some mail carriers are willing to be involved in this process, others would rather face snow and rain and heat and the gloom of night. If that’s the case, you dole out the treats while your mail carrier safely places that Amazon package on your front stoop.",

  },
  "page_content": "If you’ve ever seen dogs bark at each other from opposite sides of a fence, you know that their reactions can be unpredictable once the fence is gone. Some dogs improve their behavior when given the opportunity to meet and interact without a barrier, but others may cause real injury. A rare few have no interest in any interaction other than barking at each other through the gate or fence — as is the case in the following viral video.\nWhy dogs bark through fences\nI once saw a similar reaction with two German Shepherds who were barking at each other and walking along a fence. After traversing 50 meters of fence, they came to a spot where the fence was broken and suddenly there was no barrier between them. Both dogs stopped barking for a few seconds and looked stricken as they stared at one another with nothing to keep them apart. Then, one dog moved back to where he had come from and started barking through the fence again. The other dog followed on his own side so that soon they were back at it, barking away at each other on opposite sides of the fence as if they wanted to tear each other to shreds.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nDogs often choose not to be aggressive when they have another option. It is a reminder of the importance of avoiding situations in which dogs have no way out. The fence gives these dogs an out — a way to avoid being aggressive. Neither of these dogs wants to fight. They are both showing a common sign of fearfulness — the fear grimace, which is when they pull back the corners of their mouths. The fear grimace is a facial expression that allows us to see many of the dogs’ teeth, which is why it looks so menacing to us, but it is a behavior that indicates fear. In addition, the dog on the left approaches with its weight back and continues to lean back rather than charge forward. That is also a sign of a dog who is afraid rather than confident in the situation.\nAlthough this reaction to suddenly finding themselves without a barrier is unusual, most dog behaviorists have seen it from time to time. For some dogs, the barking is motivated by fear, while for others, it’s a territorial response. So, it’s reasonable to expect the dogs to fight if given the opportunity (since they appear to be threatening each other). Still, other dogs lose control because the other dog’s repeated appearances bring on a state ofhigh arousal and over-excitement. So, it would make sense for them to appropriately greet one another and maybe even play, if they were acting out of frustration at not being able to interact.\nGet your fix of Kinship\nWe promise not to send you garbage that turns your inbox into a litter box.

Imagine that the barking dogs are communicating something along the lines of, “Boy are you lucky that this fence is here! Why, if it weren’t for that fence, I would tear you paw from tail!” At the same time, the dogs could be thinking, in some canine sort of way, that the fence protects them from having to follow through. Their behavior suggests they understand that the barrier prohibits physical contact and that this understanding affects their behavior.\nThe situation is analogous to people in a bar, who are talking about fighting each other but are being physically restrained by their buddies, at which point they become more threatening with their words. They may say something like, “You’re lucky my friends are holding me back or I’d put you in the hospital!” while actually feeling relieved that they don’t have to fight. The physical prevention serves as a face-saving device for individuals who can talk a big game but don’t really want to follow through. Those people and these dogs can both accurately be described by saying that their bark is worse than their bite.\nIt’s hard, even for professionals, to predict how particular dogs will react if they no longer have a fence between them. In the video above, few would have predicted that when the gate is removed that the dogs would completely abandon their barking efforts and walk away from each other.",

  "page_content": "Check out YouTube and you can find an alarming number of videos of dogs chasing the light from a laser pointer, often while people laugh in the background. While it might seem fun, that laser pointer chasing can lead to serious behavioral issues — Laser Pointer Syndrome in Dogs — a real concern for pet parents. Here’s everything you need to know about how laser pointers can impact your dog’s mental health.\nAre laser pointers really that bad for dogs?\nYep, if you watch your dog’s body language when chasing the laser, you’ll quickly see that laser pointers are bad for dogs. Using a laser pointer isn’t amusing for your dog — that frantic pouncing on the dot can often be seriously unpleasant and filled with tension for pups. The movement of the light stimulates dogs to chase, but there is nothing to catch, and that is why the game is bad for dogs. Constant chasing without ever being successful at catching the moving object can frustrate dogs, leading to obsessive and destructive behaviors.\nlittleKin™ is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Check it out for expert advice, new pet tools, and a free box of food samples.\nFrom another perspective, workingscent detection dogstrained to find things like explosives, drugs or diseases have similar experiences and can become upset when they don’t make regular “finds.” These dogs need regular successful finds to stimulate their training, but they may not experience them during the course of their regular in-field work. That’s why it is standard practice to set up simulated missions in which working dogs are guaranteed to discover what they have been taught to find. Successful searches keep their skills sharp and prevent psychological problems.\nA fascination with lights and shadows is common in high-energy dogs — but it can develop into obsessive-compulsive disorder if it gets out of hand.\nA lot of dogs become obsessive about the light from laser pointers, and there are many cases of dogs who were diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder after (and perhaps partly as a result of) this activity. Dogs become preoccupied with the light, then transfer that interest to similar stimuli, sometimes developing a behavior problem in which theychase lights and shadows.\nLike with people, there’s the potential for eye damage if the laser accidentally shines directly in your dog’s eyes. Children who are unaware of the risks are more likely to cause harm to your pup’s vision.\nHow to prevent behavior problems with laser pointers.\nNo matter how much dogs respond to them, I recommend against the use of laser pointers with dogs. It’s just too likely that the game will negatively affect the dog.\nBut, one way you can use a laser pointer with your dog while also minimizing the risks of your dog developing behavioral problems and psychological damage is to use the laser as a decoy to help them find treats or a new toy. Though the dog does not ever succeed at catching the light, there is a reward in discovering other items. Using the light alongside treats and toys slightly lowers the risk of trouble but does not eliminate the danger.\nLaser pointer alternatives:\nThere are so many other games to play with your dog that are safe, amusing, and behaviorally healthy.

  "page_content": "I am obsessed with blankets. Turns out, so is my dog Leo. My blanket obsession began with a passion for textile design, which developed into a habit of buying any blanket, comforter, or quilt that caught my eye. Leo’s blanket habit is related to mine: Whenever I bring home a gorgeous coverlet, he has to chew a gigantic hole right in the middle — as soon as he is left alone with it for more than 20 seconds. While I had trouble with Leo, I’ve also learned a thing or two along the way.\nDealing With Compulsive Blanket Chewing\nSometimes I think fate must have ironically brought Leo and me together or that maybe Leo is saving me from the fate of being crushed under an avalanche of blankets when I open the linen closet. With Leo’s blanket munching, I recognized there were two issues that needed to be addressed. First, Leo could not be left alone with blankets until he learned chewing on them was inappropriate. Secondly, he needed a positive outlet for his chewing, such as a chew toy.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nKeeping Leo away from blankets worked for like a week. His tenacity for finding unattended blankets was borderline inspiring. I’d leave the bedroom door open for a minute while I went to grab clothes from the dryer: Gigantic hole in the blanket. I’d take a catnap on the sofa: Down feathers everywhere when I awoke.\nSince keeping him away from blankets wasn’t going to happen, I tried taste deterrents like bitter spray misted onto the blankets. Apparently, the only one affected by this was me. Many a nap was rudely ended by a bitter taste. After falling asleep in a blanket cocoon on the sofa (exhausted from watching back-to-back-to-back episodes of Cake Boss), my open mouth would inevitably make contact with the surface of the blanket. It was heinously gross. Meanwhile, Leo would power through the nasty flavor. For my sake, I gave up on the bitter spray.\nHow to teach your dog to enjoy, notdestroy, their toys.\nMy plan to redirect Leo’s affection from blankets to toys has been even less successful. Even after taking Leo to dog training, specifically to pique his interest in toys, he drifts after more than 20 seconds unless it is something he can eat (like a bully chew or a Kong toy). I see a future with a morbidly obese dog curled happily on elegant, intact quilts.\nThe reality is Leo and I both have issues that need to be dealt with (though I’d like to think that I can curb my blanket-purchasing habit as soon as I can curb Leo’s blanket-eating habit). What next? Do I give Leo one blanket and designate it ashis? Do I concede that maybe I won’t have nice blankets ever? Why does he have an obsession with blankets?\nWhy Do Dogs Chew on Blankets?\nDogs are instinctive chewers that explore the world with their mouths so it is better to give them their own chew toys, blankets, and ropes rather than sacrifice your blankets, bedding, and furniture. “Chewing can help relieve stress and anxiety, keep their teeth clean, and keep their minds stimulated,” says Dr. Lori Teller, a clinical associate professor at the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine. “Puppies also chew to relieve the pain and irritation of teething.” Here are a few reasons why dogs chew:\nBoredom buster\nBoredom buster\nStress relief\nStress relief\nPuppy teething\nPuppy teething\nIt feels good\nIt feels good\nMental stimulation\nMental stimulation\nHow to Stop Your From Dog Chewing Blankets\nHere are some tips that might work to stop your dog from chewing holes in your blankets. When in doubt, if you think the problem might be a medical issue, check in with your vet to make sure everything is okay, especially if the chewing turns into eating.\nMany dogs are prone to chewing or more destructive behaviors because they are bored. Exercise helps! In my case, Leo was already getting plenty of exercise, but it is a crucial starting point for anyone experiencing this problem.\nChewing is a completely normal behavior in dogs, so it can be challenging to train against their nature. One option is to provide the dog a blanket that is theirs and okay to chew (assuming their interest isn’t ineating the blanket). Sure, the blanket will turn into a shredded mess, but it’stheirshredded mess.\nWith some dogs, blanket chewing is anadolescent phasewhile they are teething; for others, it simply grows into a comforting tool. If your dog is young and still teething, you might find soft toys or stuffies are something that works.\nThey work, even if it is just for a brief blanket chewing break. No better tool in keeping dogs busy than astuffed kong.“Remove any toy that has reached the size where it can become a choking hazard or cause an intestinal obstruction,” says Teller. “If your dog chews off large pieces of the toy and swallows them, then that toy should also be taken away.”",

  "page_content": "Not a week goes by that I don’t get asked what kinds of dogs I think are the most dangerous. When people wonder about the “kinds” ofdangerous dogs, they typically think about breeds. But breed doesn’t have anything to do with it. People should focus on individual dogs and specific circumstances rather than a dog’s breed.\nDogs rarely, if ever,bite without warnings, and sometimes those signs of trouble have been going on for months or even years before the bite happens. Here’s the thing: the problem isn’t unpredictable dogs. It’s misunderstood dogs. Dogs often try hard to communicate that they are uncomfortable or don’t like what is happening to them. But if nobody understands those messages, the dogs continue to be in situations that make them unhappy, and some of those dogs may end up biting.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nAs a professional behaviorist and trainer, I know we need to better educate people about the red flags of potentialaggression in dogs. Red flags exist but are not always picked up on. Here’s what you need to know about dangerous dogs.\nFive most dangerous dogs\nWhile not every dog in these categories is dangerous, it’s important to be aware that there is an increased risk of dog bites when dealing with these types of dogs or dogs in these situations.\nDogs who arescared, nervous, oranxiousmay panic and act aggressively in order to protect themselves. And remember, awagging taildoes not mean that a dog is friendly. Being afraid is at the root of more dog aggression than any other factor.\nIf a dog has noboundariesand has never been taught how to behave, they are more likely to injure someone — perhaps by accident. People (especially children) are often bitten, scared, or hurt by dogs chasing them or jumping up on them.\nHow to teach your pup to play nice.\nIf a dog’s behavior is confusing and does not follow any obvious pattern, it’s easy to be taken off guard by their actions or inadvertently do something that upsets them. Don’t touch a dog who issleeping,eating, orchewing a toy. Respect their space — startled dogs are more likely to bite.\nJust like people, dogs are not at their best when they don’t feel well and most would prefer not to be bothered. Dogs don’t have many ways to let us know thatthey’re in painor that they want to beleft alone. They sometimes resort to agrowl, snap, or bite, especially if they’ve already tried to walk away and go off by themselves, and that didn’t get the message across.\nNot all dogs consider everyone a friend immediately. Many dogs need time to warm up to new people and don’t like being treated as a long-lost friend within five seconds of being introduced. Treating an unfamiliar dog like your best friend can be off-putting to some and lead to aggressive behavior. If you adore all dogs, remember that the feeling of love at first sight may not always be mutual.\nInsurance companies’ breed-restriction lists take a bite out of housing options\nAre certain dog breeds more dangerous?\nStereotyping breedsto predict aggressive behavior is not useful or fair. The predictability of aggression based on a dog’s breed is highly overrated. The idea of breed bans or rejecting certain animals simply because their relatives have misbehaved is not going to get us anywhere.\nCertain breeds are getting more bad press than they deserve, and aggression is a stereotype that seems to stick, even if other generalities are fitting. For example, most people with a Pit Bull know their pitty is more likely to lick an intruder to death than bite them. Yet, most of what wehear aboutis Pit Bull aggression, not excessive licking. Rottweilers and Dobermans are also breeds that many people fear on sight without any actual data about the particular animal in question.\nBreed-specific legislation has profound impacts on families, their dogs, and animal welfare professionals.\nOn the other hand, there’s no denying that certain lines of dogs that have been bred for aggression do exhibit it. Regrettably, aggression is easy to breed for if that is someone’s intent. However, not all members of breeds who have been bred for aggression are from lines with that sort of breeding history.Nurture is key, and anyone can make a fearful, aggressive dog with improper care.\nIn my experience, some dog breeds who more commonly have aggression issues are Golden Retrievers and Labrador Retrievers. Are these bad dogs? Aggressive breeds? Of course not. They are justcommon breeds, so statistically are more likely to be noted as aggressive. Any breed can have an aggression issue. Aggression is far more predictable based on a dog’s previous behavior than on the breed.\nWhy do dogs bite?\nIt’s important when working with an aggressive dog to understand as much as possible about why the dog is biting. Some dogs bite because of fear, because they feel threatened, because they’re in pain, or they feel overwhelmed.\nDogs use their mouths both playfully and not so playfully as puppies, and the vast majority of them develop normalbite inhibition— an understanding of what they are and are not allowed to do with their mouths. Biting is a normal part of canine behavior. While people are more inclined to hit when behaving aggressively, emotions such as anger and frustration combined with high arousal are typically involved with dogs who bite in an out-of-control way.\nSuch bites happen when dogs have the canine equivalent of a toddler’s tantrum because they don’t get what they want. Dogs who bite in these contexts are literally unable to control themselves. It is much harder to substantially improve their behavior compared with other dogs, most of whom are biting as a result of fear.\nSigns of aggression before the bite\nSome dogs already have a bite history towards dogs or people and that’s a clear warning it could happen again — especially if it was an attack that was prolonged and hard to stop. Such relentless aggression is a serious red flag that the dog has trouble with inhibition.\nOther typical warning signs that a dog may bite include growling, barking, lunging, tooth displaying especially with an offensive pucker, a tendency to get frustrated, difficulty calming down after getting revved up, going stiff, tongue flicking, charging at anything of interest, hard stares directed at another individual, facial expressions indicating nervousness or discomfort, becoming mouthy when in an aroused state, excessive sniffing of the ground in social situations, guarding food or toys and being fearful of people, animals, or any other object.\nA PSA to pay better attention to our best friends’ body language.\nWhat to do if your dog has signs of aggression\nAny of these signs, or even the general feeling that something is amiss, warrants a consultation with a person trained to deal with serious behavioral problems in dogs, such as a certified applied animal behaviorist, trainer, or veterinarian board certified in behavior. It’s better to get ahead of aggression withgood training.\nIt’s also helpful to get an outside perspective on how you interact with your dog and your home life, or other environments you spend a lot of time with your dog in. Often, aggression comes from stress or fear, and it may simply be a matter of de-stressing your pup’s life.\nThere’s hope for the overwhelming majority of dogs with a bite history, as many are able to improve their behavior with a combination of behavior modification and a sensible management plan for prevention. However, there is the rare dog whose likelihood of improvement is small because of a lack of any kind of self-control and the tendency to bite when frustrated, angry, and aroused.\nGive your dog some grace, and some care, and these are hopefully issues that never go beyond a warning growl.",

  "page_content": "Shiloh is a six-month-old terrier mix female from the rescue shelter that we brought home. She is terrific and has taken well to our household including our five-year-old terrier mix male. My concern is that no matter when my husband enters a room, my dog barks at him like she has never seen him before. The barking is continuous. He plays with her, even hand-feeds her at times, pets her, and does all he can to help her bond with him.  She seems to be “easy” around females and shies away from most males.\nShiloh seems afraid. Often the scariest situation for dogs is the appearance or approach of a person with whom they are not yet comfortable. Manyfearful dogsreact more to men than to women — especially men who are tall, have deep voices, broad shoulders, a strong jaw, or facial hair.\nGuess the breed from their tell-tale tails. (And try saying that five times fast.)\nTo help Shiloh exhibit better behavior when your husband enters the room, it is essential to change the way she feels in that situation. Focus on changing her emotions so the behavior will stop rather than trying to stop the barking directly.\nHelp Your Dog Overcome a Fear of Men\nThere are two ways your husband can help Shiloh overcome her fear so that she does not bark at him in this context. One technique is to present himself in the least threatening way possible. When he enters a room, he should turn slightly to the side, lean ever so slightly away from the dog, and squat.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nThe second technique is to teach Shiloh to associate the appearance of your husband with feeling good. The basic idea is to consistently pair up what Shiloh loves best with your husband entering the room. For most dogs, this means steak, chicken, or freeze-dried liver (no dry biscuits!), but some dogs adore balls or squeaky toys. Instead of her thinking, “Yikes! He’s here and he’s so imposing!” we want her to think, “Here he is again! Where are those super treats (or toys)? I’m so happy he’s here with that magical stuff!”\nTo make the combination of these two techniques most effective, every time your husband enters the room, he should do so calmly, position himself in the non-imposing stance, and immediately (within a second) throw the treats or toys to her. Ideally, he will toss them to her before she reacts, but he should toss them anyway, even if she’s already starting barking. It’s better to toss them as opposed to handing them directly to her. That way, he does not have to approach her, which could set her off. Her special favorite item should be reserved for this situation only to make the pairing with your husband as tight as possible in her mind.\nIf you follow these steps, Shiloh should adjust to your husband — and any other new men in her life — in no time.",
