  "page_content": "The moment you leave for vacation, theguilt sets in. Not only are you waiting at the airport gate missing your dog, but your dog is backhome with their sitter(a stranger, basically!), sobbing into their dinner bowl and wondering how you could possibly have abandoned them after they’ve beenso good. Anangel, really.\nAt least that’s the dramatic scenario that plays out in your head — and, let’s face it, the one that most pet parents probably imagine. (Although, let’s be clear, we know our audience is full of the kind of pet parents whocarefully vet their pet sitters.) But the real question is: Do our dogs actually miss us, or is it all a human construct, and we should calm down?\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nHow do dogs experience time?\nFirst, it’s important to note that dogs don’t experience time like people do, and this affects whether they know how long we’ve been gone. Obviously, they can’t tap their iPhone to see how long it’s been since you left, so they have to do the next best thing. “They have a very good sense of smell,” says dog trainerTerry Lynn Cuyler. “Your scent fades over time, and this is how they can sense how long you have been away.” In other words, theycan smell time.\nSo, your pup can tell that your scent has started to dissipate, and that will give them a sense of whether you’ve been away 20 minutes or 20 hours. Our pups can also respond to other clues that time has passed, such as sunlight and noises outside, like people driving home from work or birds chirping in the morning.\n“Dogs are excellent at understanding contextual cues and joining the dots of what is happening in their environment,” trainerPetrina Firthchimes in. “This is why typically people tend to think their dog knows they are coming before someone actually arrives home or when dinnertime is.”\nDo dogs miss us?\nBecause our dogs have a sense of how long we’ve been gone, logic would suggest that they are sad that we are away for long periods of time.\n“If we allow for the fact that they’re sentient beings and that they have complex emotional lives, there will obviously be some similarities on how a dog might experience the person that they’re bonded to being absent,” trainerMatt Beisnersays. But, he notes, it’s not quite so simple.\nAsdog-cognition expert Alexandra Horowitztoldthis TikToker, we tend to anthropomorphize our dogs’ behavior, or in other words, attribute human characteristics to our pets.\n“The anthropomorphization and concept of ‘missing us’ may be more of a humanization of how we think dogs feel when separated from us,” Firth says. “Missing someone suggests a contemplative state and is perhaps an oversimplification when talking aboutseparation-related behavior.”\nThat kind of thinking doesn’t help us to necessarily understand our dogs and their needs better either.\n“Humans brood over memories, count the hours, and grow lonely from time to time. Dogs live in the moment,” Cuyler says. “They don’t sit and reflect on that great walk last Sunday. But that is not to say they don’t miss us. They do notice changes in routine, surroundings, and most of all, the feeling of security.”\nThat’s why it’s so important to make sure you trust the person who’s watching your dog while you’re away (or, if you’re gone only a few hours, to make sure your dog has everything they need while you’re out).\nAs dog behavior consultant Daniel Nealetold Kinshiplast year: “Don’t worry about them missing you too much, as long as they are having their needs met and they’re comfortable.” He added that dogs’ needs are much more immediate and that “it’s less likely that your dog is going to miss you [in the way you miss them].”\nYou can help your pup feel safe when you’re gone.\nThat’s not to say your dog won’t notice your absence (as anyone whose dog has experiencedseparation anxietycan attest). “Dogs can feel huge emotional pain when separated. Some dogs feel intense panic or anxiety and others a huge amount of frustration and anger,” Firth says, noting that these separation problems are typically due to unmet psychological needs or a lack of human interaction.\nBeisner makes sure that he lets his Blue Nose Pit Bull know she’s safe before he leaves. “Deja Blue is what we would call ananxious dog,” he says. “She’s really sensitive, so I go spend time with her, and at this point, it’s probably not more than 20 to 30 seconds, but she likes abelly rub. I just look for opportunities to connect with her. I look for changes in her body language that tell me that her heart rate is slowing down, her breathing is slowing down, and she’s in a better frame of mind when I leave.”\nFirth stresses that keeping your dog’s routine as normal as possible can help them feel comfortable while you’re away. “However, for many dogs, extended absences can often equal a larger disruption in routines and understanding of predictable schedules, which can make the dog more anxious as their world keeps changing,” she adds.\nIf your pup is having trouble with separation anxiety — or with handling your absence during vacations, for example — it’s smart to work with your veterinarian or apositive-reinforcement traineror behaviorist. These people can help your dog live their best life, even on the days when you’re not right there with them.\nEvery dog is different.\nThe extent to which your dog “misses” you might also depend on the individual animal. “I’ve encountered dogs that don’t bat an eye when their owner leaves and others that howl at the door the second they’re alone,” Cuyler notes.\n“They’ll have their own unique emotional experience,” Beisner says. “For a Pit Bull family, when we come home, we get the wiggles, you know? My Terrier used to give me the hops; my Husky wouldhowl at me.”\nAnd the more secure a dog is in their environment, the less they might be bummed in your absence (and that’s a good thing). Beisner points out that it could be a positive sign if your pup doesn’t run to the door when you arrive home; it suggests that they were comfortable enough without you there.\n“Dogs that are used to structure and confidence-building exercises handle separation so much better than dogs that are unsure of their surroundings,” Cuyler adds. “This is why training is not just about teaching ‘sit’ and ‘stay.’ It’s about building trust, comfort, and astrong bond, so even when you're not there, your dog will know everything is OK.”\nBeisner echoes that.\n“We’re starting to talk more and more about a dog being resilient [in the behavior world], and that’s not because we’re trying to make life hard on them, but we want them to be able to feel more resilient in this modern world, which is so challenging,” he says.\nSo, what’s the final verdict?\nDo our dogs really miss us? “Not necessarily in the same way that we do,” Cuyler says. “But when they see us walk through that door, their joy is 100 percent real. And that’s even better.”\nWhat’s more, it’s essential to always be sensitive to their needs and find ways to make sure they feel safe, even when we’re not there to keep an eye on them.\n“It’s worth remembering that from an evolutionary perspective, we designed dogs to want to hang out with us, and be with us,” Firth says. “For some breeds, we explicitly designed them as companion dogs, so their neediness and ‘missing us’ is an adaptation we selected for.”",

  "page_content": "Thewildfires that ravagedLos Angeles in January brought out the best in the pet community. Animal lovers eagerlystepped up to helpbyadopting and fostering pets affected by the fires. One local veterinarianopened an empty hospitalto care for dozens of pets, while a Los Angeles shelterrescued more than 800 displaced animals.\nThese acts of kindness are a wonderful reminder of how communities can work together, but the road ahead is a long one. The people who went through these horrifying events will no doubt be processing them emotionally for a long time to come. But what happens to our pets’ little nervous systems after they go through something scary?\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nTraumatic events canaffect animals in the same way as they do humans; most mammals share the same basic brain structure. “The triggers can be different for different species due to many years of evolution and the need to avoid different dangers, says Dr. Ori Stollar, a veterinarian and behavior specialist withMassachusetts Veterinary Behavior Service. “But any trigger that causes severe fear or any emotional or physical stress has the potential to cause trauma.”\nSo, if pets react like we do to upsetting events, can they experience trauma or even get post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), too? And if so, how can we help them heal?\nPets respond to trauma like we do.\nJust like with humans, science has found that companion animals sometimes respond fearfully to triggers after experiencing extreme physical injury, disease, loud noises, and traumatic eventslike natural disasters. But veterinarians might hesitate before labeling these responses “PTSD.”\nAlthough we know that pets can internalize trauma, the term “PTSD” is generally a human term. Veterinary medicine does not have its ownDSM-5(mental-healthdiagnostic manual), Stollar points out, so veterinarians might hesitate to label a pet with any kind of condition or disorder. Still, he says, several studies have revealed behavioral changes in pets that mirror those seen in human PTSD —like anxiety, hypervigilance, andincreased aggression.\n“Not every pet with these behaviors has PTSD,” Stollar says. “But they might help us diagnose this condition if a comprehensive history is available and might also indicate the triggers that might lead to it.”\nHow can you tell if your pet is traumatized?\nSometimes, it’s hard to know how to care for an animal who’s struggling emotionally — we can’t exactly ask a dog or cat for alist of triggers. Still, veterinarians do have a few tools to help them better understand what’s going on with fearful pets.\n“There is progress being made with using techniques,such as fMRI, to monitor the brains of living animals without causing physical trauma to them,” Stollar says. And outside of that, monitoring dogs’ and cats’ behavior can also reveal a lot about their state of mind.\nFor instance, experts might ask pet parents to fill out questionnaires to explore how their dogs and cats interact with their environments — effectively mapping out how theyrespond to stress. (A distressed dog maylick their lips, while an anxious cat may make their ears low and flat.) In some studies, Stollar adds, scholars have observed animals trying to perform a task or solve a problem to find out if they are moreoptimistic or pessimistic.\nIf you believe that your pet is dealing with trauma, the best thing you can do is watch for any differences in how they act. This applies to dogs, cats, horses, and all other animals.\n“It might be something very easy to notice,” Stollar says — like a dog or cat becoming more aggressive to humans or other animals. They might become less sociable or begin avoiding specific people, locations, or situations. They might become hypervigilant or more reactive to their surroundings than they have been in the past.\nIn other cases, Stollar says, the signs are more subtle. Your pet might change their eating habits, either byeating lessor at a different pace than usual. Pets who used to graze throughout the day might startwolfing down their food all at once, and those who used to chow down immediately might begin taking their time. Their sleep patterns might change as well.\nMore often than not, Stollar says, cats are a little harder to read than dogs, “unless the change is presented as increased aggression.”\n“Many cats tend to avoid people and hide more when traumatized,” Stollar says. “And many cat owners might regard it as normal cat behavior. So, my advice would be that any behavior change, especially a sudden one or one that follows a traumatic event, should be addressed by going to the primary care veterinarian to rule out a medical issue, and then to areward-based trainerwith experience in this type of issues or a veterinary behaviorist.”\nWhat should you do if your pet exhibits signs of trauma?\nIf you know your pet’s triggers, avoid them as much as possible. For instance: If your dog can’tstand loud noises, don’t take them to loud venues and celebrations. If your cat suffered anextreme illnessthat required a specific diet, avoid reminding them of that experience by steering clear of foods that might taste or smell similar.\n“Because every pet is different, there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution,” Stollar says. “So knowing what the triggers are and avoiding them is a great first step.”\nIn some cases, pet parents can create positive experiences around old triggers to make them less stressful. In those cases, however, it’s best to move slowly and, when appropriate,work with a trainerto avoid scaring your pet even more. “Sometimes, the pet will be able to bounce back without us having to actively do anything,” Stollar says. “But if the behavior persists, then you should try to address it and prevent it from worsening.”\nWhen should you see a vet?\nEarly treatment is always better than waiting, Stollar says. In some cases,anti-anxiety medicationsmight be necessary to help your pet live peacefully and without fear.\nIf you’re familiar with gentle,rewards-based training methods, counterconditioning, desensitization, and environmental enrichment, you can try some work at home to see if your pet becomes more at ease. At the same time, Stollar cautions, “behavior issues can get worse fast — especially if they lead to physical danger to the pet or others around. If the pet parent is not skilled, then he or she should seek help as soon as possible.”\nThe sooner a qualified professional intervenes, the better off everyone involved will be.",

  "page_content": "Obviously, all we ever want to do is stay home cuddling our perfect pups. But sometimes, life gets in the way, and we have to leave our pets behind for pesky things like work, grocery runs, or (cover your dog’s eyes) canine-free travel. And as hard as it is for us to leave those puppy eyes at the door, it can be even harder for our pets — particularly those who suffer from separation anxiety.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nFirst things first: What is separation anxiety in dogs?\nIn a nutshell,separation anxietyoccurs when a dog experiences fear or panic when they’re left alone. Sometimes, it’s triggered by a specific person leaving the house; other times, it happens when anyone leaves. Common signs of separation anxietyinclude barking, panting, drooling,destroying furniture, peeing or poopingin the house, pacing, or an inability to settle down.\nKeep in mind that separation anxiety isn’t your dog’s fault. They have become separated from their support and social group, which can cause significant stress and even fear(for humans as well).Their actions aren’t a way to get back at you; instead, they are normal responses to stress and anxiety. Rather than blaming your dog, try to remain patient and understanding when helping them manage it.\nLike most things in 2023, there’s a Zoom link for this.\nWhat are the causes of separation anxiety in dogs?\nIt’s hard to know the exact causes of separation anxiety in dogs, but it usually has to do with major life changes. For example, a change in family (if your pup was rescued or adopted) or a change in their environment (if you moved from one house to another orwent back to work).\nAnother stressor could be the sudden absence of a pet parent, whether from a divorce or a death in the family. Loneliness, boredom, and old age can also cause separation anxiety in dogs. Don’t forget past experiences can weigh in as well. If they were abandoned, for example, their new human leaving may dredge up negative memories.\nSymptoms of separation anxiety\nEvery dog is going to respond to stress differently (sounds pretty familiar, right?). Some will start showing these signs while you’re getting ready because they know what’s coming. Others may only start to get upset after you’ve left, which may mean you have towatch them howl or cryon the pet or nanny cam. Some of the signs can include:\nLethargy or withdrawal\nLethargy or withdrawal\nNot eating\nNot eating\nClinginess\nClinginess\nPanting, pacing, or drooling\nPanting, pacing, or drooling\nTrembling, shivering\nTrembling, shivering\nHowling, barking, whining\nHowling, barking, whining\nChewing, scratching, or destroying items in your home\nChewing, scratching, or destroying items in your home\nSelf-destruction\nSelf-destruction\nUrinating or defecating in the house\nUrinating or defecating in the house\nWhat are the different types of separation anxiety in dogs?\nThere aren’t specific types of separation anxiety in dogs, butresearch showsthat there are four underlying frustrations that could be causing your dog’s anxiety. The four main forms of distress are: wanting to get to something outside, wanting to get away from something in the house, reacting to outside events or noises, andsevere boredom. The researchers note that getting to the root of the problem can help you treat your dog more effectively.\nNow this is stressingmeout. How do I help my dog?\nThe best-case scenario, at least if you ask your dog, is for you to literally never leave the house without them again. (But they might say that even if they don’t have separation anxiety.) The next best thing is to try to address symptoms of separation anxiety while you’re able to spend time at home.\nStart by paying attention to how your dog acts when you’re getting ready to leave the house. Look for signs that include pacing, panting,pulling their ears back, following you around, hiding, and — the ultimate sign that something is wrong — refusing treats. Also, check to see if your dog seems panicked when you close a door between you and them or leave the house briefly to take out the garbage. These are all signs of distress.\nIf you can’t tell if your dog is acting fearful or anxious, a little spying can come in handy. Try leaving your pup home for very short periods while watching themthrough a webcamto see how they react while you’re out. Not only can you get a good look at their behavior, but you may also be able to tell if there are any other triggers (loud noises, Amazon drivers dropping off yetanotherpackage at the door) contributing to the problem.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nWhat can I do to relieve anxiety (mine and my dog’s)?\nSeparation anxiety is tough — for both of you. Your dog is upset, and you’re upset that your dog is upset. It’s all very upsetting. Luckily, there are a few steps you can take totrain your pupto be more comfortable with being left alone.\nDogs are big fans of routines. Routines help them understand what you expect of them and what they can expect from their day. Set a morning schedule for activities such as feeding, potty breaks, and playtime or walks. This allows your dog to predict when they’ll receive your attention and when they’re on their own. They still might not want you to leave the house, but at least they won’t be blindsided when they see you reach for the car keys.\nEveryone loves a cozy nap spot, and dogs are no exception. Create a comfortable, safe place where your dog can chill. Maybe it’sa crate. Maybe it’s a back room of the house. Or — let’s be honest — it might be smack dab in the middle of your bed.\nStart training your dog to go to their happy place whenever it’s time to settle down. You can even turn on some music or leave a piece of clothing with your scent on it to help your dog feel at ease. The goal is for your dog to create a positive association with this spot and get used to being there by themselves, even when you’re in the house. Then, when you start to leave, they know they have a place they can go to feel safe and relaxed.\nOne word of caution: Some dogs who experience severe separation anxiety can panic and attempt to break free from crates — and hurt themselves in the process. So, be sure your dog is comfortable wherever their safe space is, especially if that’s being confined, before leaving them alone.\nTry not to draw attention to the fact that you’re getting ready to leave. If you can, have your dog settle in their happy place while you finish getting ready. Avoid dramatic goodbyes (even though you probably need a hug yourself before heading to work). When it’s time to go, give your dog a long-lasting treat (frozenpeanut butter-stuffed Kongswork great) or a toy that will keep them occupied long after you leave the house.\nIt’s 2023, and the office is calling. How can our dogs cope?\nHow to manage separation anxiety\nIf your dog still isn’t into a little alone time, there may be more options. Keep in mind that if your dog is truly miserable being home alone for more than just a few hours,doggie daycarecould be a godsend. There, your pup can socialize with people and other pets while getting in their daily exercise to boot. Win-win.\nDesensitizationtraining is a popular method for dogs with fears or phobias. It works by exposing your pup to small doses of what they don’t like, giving them praise and encouragement to show them it’s okay, and rewarding them when they respond appropriately. Exposure is gradually increased until they feel comfortable.\nWhen dealing with separation anxiety, this typically means giving your dog short periods of being alone and rewarding them when they’re calm and collected. This often starts with leaving them alone in a room for a few minutes and then petting them when you return. You can increase these times with short trips outside and then longer trips where you actually leave, showing them that no matter howlong you leave for, you’ll always come back.\nUse this one separately or as part of desensitization. It’s a veryflexible training methodthat simply includes rewarding your dog’s good behavior and ignoring or redirecting the bad. So, when a dog stays calm while you get ready to leave, reward them. If they start to whine or pace, redirect them to their safe place or give them a toy or treat to occupy them and then reward them.\nSome dogs are just more anxious than others. and even the best training won’t help them stay calm. In these cases, you may need a little herbal support. There are manynatural calming aidsin many different forms on the market, so be sure to talk to your vet about the ones they deem safe and effective.\nThen there are some dogs whose anxiety doesn’t respond to natural remedies either, so prescription medications may be necessary. Keep in mind: Good medications aren’t sedatives that make your dog seem calm because they feel tired; they help decrease anxiety at the brain level so your dog truly feels better about your departure.\nHow to treat and prevent confinement anxiety.\nHow do I prevent separation anxiety from developing in the first place?\nThe best way to prevent separation anxiety is to train them from a young age, during puppyhood, but here are some other preventative tips for separation anxiety in dogs:\nMake sure your pup has everything they need — physically, socially, and emotionally — so they don’t freak out when you leave the house.\nWhen you’re home with your pup, don’t fuss over them too much. Give them some space. Constant attention will make it harder for your pup when you leave.\nOffer your dog a toy, such asa food puzzle, to work on while you’re gone. It will keep them occupied and lessen their fear of being left alone.\nIt might sound silly, but playing some chill tunes, like classical music, may help keep your dog calm when you’re gone all day.\nWhen do I need to bring in the pros?\nThe sooner, the better. While it may seem like a trainer is the best person to reach out to first, your veterinarian may be the better option. They will be able to diagnose or rule out medical causes for the behavior first.\nWhile your veterinarian can treat any underlying medical issues, acertified traineror behaviorist can help come up with a plan to teach your dog that being alone doesn’t have to be scary. The recommendations will vary depending on your pet, but if you do use a trainer, be sure to do some research upfront.\nDisclaimer alert: This article is here to share information. But, much like pineapple on pizza, the topic may be controversial, meaning that not all vets or pet professionals agree. Every pet has specific needs. So, don’t take this as fact or medical advice. Talk things over with your vet when making decisions, and use your best judgment (about both your pet’s health and pizza toppings).\nWell-trained dogs have more freedom (and more fun).\nBottom line\nSeparation anxiety is no fun for either you or your dog. Not only does it make it more difficult for you to escape the house, but it can also be detrimental to your dog’s health and your property. Fortunately, there are many methods that can help put your dog more at ease with being alone, and if all else fails, don’t be afraid to reach out to your veterinarian.\nWe asked both animal behaviorists and human psychologists howyoucan deal with leaving your dog home alone.\nFAQs\nIt depends. Every dog and every situation is different, so it's hard to say how long it will take to see improvement in your dog's separation anxiety.\nSome home remedies for separation anxiety include playing your dog soothing music while you're gone or using a plug-in diffuser,such as Adaptil.\nThough any dog of any breed can develop separation anxiety, Border Collies, Labs, Jack Russell Terriers, and German Shepherds are a few that do so more frequently. This is because they tend to develop strong bonds with their pet parents and require a lot of physical and mental stimulation.\nThere’s no one answer for this – instead, it’s a combination of genetics, past experiences, temperament, and environmental changes that contribute to separation anxiety. It’s typically triggered by a sudden change in routine or environment that throws off their schedule.\nReferences\n“Positive Reinforcement Training.”The Humane Society of the United States.https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/positive-reinforcement-training.\n“Positive Reinforcement Training.”The Humane Society of the United States.https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/positive-reinforcement-training.\n“Reducing Fear and Stress with Desensitization and Counterconditioning.”VCA Animal Hospitals.https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/overcoming-fears-with-desensitization-and-counterconditioning.\n“Reducing Fear and Stress with Desensitization and Counterconditioning.”VCA Animal Hospitals.https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/overcoming-fears-with-desensitization-and-counterconditioning.",

  "page_content": "Dogs are so expressive and full of emotion, which is why we connect with them on such a deep level, and why many dogs will experience anxiety at some point in their lives. When you see your dog with a furrowed brow, shaking, or whimpering, it’s easy to relate to how they’re feeling and interpret that as anxiety.\nOther times, dogs display anxiety in ways that are more subtle and these signs may be confused with other physical or behavioral concerns. The good news is that there are lots of effective ways to help ease your pup’s anxiety.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhat is dog anxiety?\nAnxiety is a reaction to ananticipatedthreat that has not actually happened. It can result in both behavioral and physical changes that are commonly referred to as the body’s “fight or flight response.” In dogs, this includes changes in their body language likelip-licking, panting, whining, tucking their tail,pulling their ears back, shaking, hiding, barking, growling, or avoiding eye contact. It can also involve physical changes, like dilated pupils, tense muscles, an increased heart rate, urinating, or defecating.\nThese same changes are seen in situations when dogs are experiencing fear. The difference is that fear implies there is an active threat while anxiety is based on a future event that they expect to encounter. The flight-or-fight response is adaptive, meaning it has beneficial effects in the right setting. When there really is a clear and present threat, dogs need to protect themselves by running away or fighting back.\nThe physical changes that occur during this response help a dog to focus, run faster, and get a boost of energy to protect themselves. The trouble is that this response is not adaptive when the threat is thevacuum cleaner,or simply you leaving the house to get the mail. When a dog’s fear or anxiety is working overtime and in settings that are notactuallythreatening, it can be problematic. Dogs displaying these signs are distressed, and they don’t feel safe or happy. They may also make you stressed out by creating situations that are destructive or unsafe. For both your dog’s sake and your own peace of mind, it is very important to help them overcome their fears and anxieties. This involves first characterizing their fear or anxiety and learningwhat triggers it. There are many different underlying reasons for a dog’s behavior, and targeting your treatment to the right one is crucial.\nNot that you want to be away from them anyway.\nDog separation anxiety\nSeparation anxiety is one of the most common forms of fear and anxiety seen in dogs and may affect up to 50 percent of dogs.Separation anxiety is an umbrella termfor a collection of signs and behaviors in dogs, and it can have many different motivations.\nSome common signs of separation anxiety are dogs who are like Velcro with their humans, never leaving their sides and following them from room to room. When they see their pet parentspreparing to leave—picking up on cues like putting on a coat or picking up their car keys — dogsmay start to whimper, pace, lick their lips, or show other signs of distress.\nOnce they are alone, they may bark or howl incessantly, scratch at the door, chew up furniture or clothing, or pee and poop inside. This is associated with a fear that their favorite person is never coming back. These behaviors are often compounded by other challenges they are facing including boredom or frustration.\nAnxiety due to specific fears\nSometimes, the line between anxiety and fear is blurred, as is often the case with specific phobias. A phobia is a fear of something they perceive as a threat, leading to that whole fight-or-flight response. Some dogs may also have anxiety beforehand if they suspect they will be exposed to their phobia. For example, dogs that get anxious on every car ride because they predict they are going to the vet.\nSome of the most common phobias in dogs arenoise-related phobiaslike vacuum cleaners, hair dryers, or loud vehicles. Storm, thunder, and firework phobias are also very common in dogs. Dogs who are under-socialized may also be afraid of small children, strangers, or even other dogs if they do not know how to properly interact. They may show signs of fear in new situations or with unfamiliar objects. This can lead to a range of behaviors including hiding, running away, growling, barking, or even acts of aggression when they feel threatened.\nAge-related anxiety\nDogs can show mental and behavioral changes related to old age that lead to anxiety, just like humans.Cognitive dysfunction is the term used in dogswhen they showsigns mimicking dementia. This includespacing and whining, especially at night, getting stuck in corners or behind doors, confusion, forgetting cues they were trained on previously, or having accidents in the house. Old age can also be associated with increased anxiety due to certain physical changes.\nSenior dogsmay have decreased visionor hearing, which can make them feel less certain about their surroundings. They may have more trouble keeping tabs on where their favorite human is or be caught off guard by sights and sounds. They may also have pain related to chronic conditions,like arthritis, which make them anxious about being handled or playing rough with other dogs.\nIf you notice sudden behavioral changes in your dog, especially if there are also physical changes, like shaking, accidents in the house, or panting, it is important to see a vet right away. Medical conditions can also lead to behavioral changes, including increased anxiety andsigns related to pain. It is important to rule out a medical cause first. Your vet can also be a helpful resource in treating anxiety. Most of the time, a multimodal approach is the best way to improve a dog’s anxiety.\nThis means using lots of differenttools including exercise, behavior modification, training, enrichment, andmedication to bring them maximum relief. A veterinary behaviorist or trainer can help you create a behavior modification plan as well. Some pet parents have a tendency to downplay behavioral problems like anxiety in their pets and presume that they can manage them on their own. However, it is important to recognize that managing a dog’s anxiety, especially when it leads to destructive or aggressive behaviors can be extremely distressing to pet parents and take a toll on their own mental health. Seeking professional help can make a big difference in your relationship with your dog and avoid more serious consequences like having to rehome your dog or incur large expenses if your dog damages your home.

Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat does it mean when a dog imprints?\nImprinting, or bonding, occurs when a dog develops a trusting, dependent, and close attachment to a human or other animal. It often happens at a young age, but can occur at various stages in life. Rather than love at first sight, it’s a process that takes time. Imprinting can lead to a strong attachment, which may have both positive and potentially distressing aspects to it.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\n10 signs your dog has imprinted on you\nYou may have a feeling that your dog has put you on a pedestal.

That’s because precocial species, like many birds, cows, and horses, tend to imprint on the first thing they see after hatching or being born. They rely on this person or animal to keep them safe and teach them the ways of the world.\nDogs are a little bit different in that they are altricial, meaning that they are born needing a little time before they’re ready to get up and get going. Rather than imprint on the first thing they see, they tend to learn about their environment from their mother, littermates, and any humans or other animals that are around. As they continue to develop, they can form strong bonds with those closest to them, not just the ones they saw first after birth.\nEach dog is different, and so is the time that it takes them to imprint on a human. Some dogs are quick to trust and devote themselves to their one and only, while others take a little bit of time. The age of the dog as well as any negative past experiences can play large roles.\nDogs who are part of a family can form strong bonds with more than one person. However, they still tend to pick favorites, slightly preferring one person more than others.\nCan your dog be too attached to you?\nIt feels good to be your pup’s numero uno. But is there a potential downside to this attachment thing? There is such a thing as becoming too attached. The main concern about this isseparation anxiety. Some dogs can be so into their chosen humans that they actually become anxious when they’re not with them. Separation anxiety can become a serious issue with dogs becoming destructive to themselves or to your things.\nIf you have concerns about separation anxiety — or other signs that your dog struggles when you’re not around to show them the ropes — check in with your veterinarian or a veterinary behaviorist for advice on managing their behavior.\nAnother potential downside is poor behavior towards other family members. While you may be able to get your dog to go potty on a leash or use their manners at dinnertime, they may not be so helpful when another person asks the same thing of them. This can create negative experiences with other people who aren’t as closely attached to your dog as you are.\nThe three stages of puppy imprinting\nThis stage begins when a puppy first opens their eyes and can last until they are seven months old. The most critical period is from three to 12 weeks of age, when a puppy is learning and observing other dogs, especially their mother and litter mates. They start to understand dog-to-dog social skills such asbite inhibitionandcanine social signaling, with learning about their environment coming in the latter part of this stage.\nThis stage usually happens when puppies are between seven and 12 weeks old and is when puppies start to learn that there is a much bigger world beyond their littermates and mothers. Positive human interactions play a big role in how they will connect with people in the future. This is typically when we think of a puppy imprinting on a human.\nThis is when puppies are most likely to develop intense fears of even seemingly minor factors. Make sure youkeep trainingand the rest of their environment positive, because this is when your pup could become scared or anxious, caused by specific triggers. Fear periods usually happen between eight and 11 weeks, as well as six to 14 months of age.\nAt what age do dogs stop imprinting?\nThe early socialization periods when your puppy is ripe for imprinting typically wrap up by about four months of age. But what if you get your dog later in life, when they’re past this initial rapid learning phase? Not to worry: Dogs can be very forgiving, so strong social bonds and other learning can occur after theinitial socialization period. However, patience is key as it may take a little more time and encouragement for older dogs to imprint on humans.\nCommon dog imprinting behaviors explained\nIf your dog has imprinted on you, you will notice that they will act quite attached to you. You might not be able to go far without them following you (hello, bathroom trip for two?), and they might experience separation anxiety or other anxious behaviors when you are not with them.\nIf you have a little shadow, this likely means your dog trusts and loves you deeply. You make them feel safe and cared for. It might be annoying that they are trailing you just about everywhere you go — but you’re their person, and that has to feel good.\nA study published in2017 by researchers in Austriafound that dogs are sensitive to their parents’ emotional states. They can pick up those feelings over time and begin to mirror their humans’ behavior.\nIf you are the only one who has practiced training with your dog, you will likely be theonlyperson your dog listens to. This is why it’s important for all family members — if you do not live alone — to participate in training, so there is consistency in your dog’s behavior. Otherwise, your dog may learn to only respect your commands and not others’ commands.\nIf your dog is constantly checking in with you, they are probably emotionally attached to you. They feel safe and secure when they are near you and know where you are. Some dogs even like to stay in physical contact with you,leaning on youto show their support and admiration.\nYour dog wants to be near you because you provide comfort and safety to them. It could also be that they are trying tocommunicate something to you. They may be hungry or want to go for a walk.\nYour dog stares soulfully into your eyes because they love you. In fact, staring into each other’s eyes releases oxytocin (aka the love hormone) in both humans and dogs, making both of you feel good.\nThe number one reason is because your laundry and stuff smell like you. It’s comforting and makes them feel safe to be surrounded by your scent. This is another sign that they want to be close to you.\nDogs are pretty amazing creatures — they can use all of their senses to understand how we’re feeling.Research showsthey can recognize humans’ emotions in our facial expressions. Because your dog can sense your emotions, they can probably pick up on cues when you are craving their attention.\nDogs lick their humans for many different reasons. This is a way of grooming you and expressing their love, but it’s also how they might get your attention or soothe themselves if they are feeling stressed. Or maybe you just worked out, and your salty, sweaty skin tastes good to them (probably not the post-workout routine you were looking for). Your dog might also lick you to get you to stop doing something they are not enjoying. It’s always important to pay attention to their otherbody language, too.\nRemember that bit about how dogs feel safer with a certain person in their family? If your pup is snoozing at your feet, orsitting on you, this means they feel secure with you. You mean safety and comfort to them.\nYour dog is excited by your presence, and you make them happy. So, when you come home after being gone (even if you were just running to the grocery store for five minutes), they are overwhelmed by the fact that you’re back with them.\nWant a better relationship with your pup? Here’s how to bond with your dog\nBeing a dog parent means more than just providing your pup with food, water, and shelter. Bonding with your dog comes down to spending quality time with them. This means exercising, playing, and training them.\nTake them for walks where they feel safe and secure, and also have a little fun. Dogs need daily exercise for their physical and mental health. Keep it fun by switching up the route or routine.\nPlay games that stimulate their mind and associate you with good times. Interactive games like tug-of-war or fetch are great options because they require close interaction with you. Of course, playing can also mean a quiet petting session. It doesn’t always have to involve activity.\nMost dogs love to learn things, so teaching them obedience commands and tricks is a great way to help them see that you make a great companion. Always usepositive reinforcementwhen training, and never punish your dog. Punishing them can create fear and anxiety, which you don’t want associated with you.\nBottom line\nImprinting in dogs occurs when a pup forms a strong bond or attachment to a human.\nImprinting in dogs occurs when a pup forms a strong bond or attachment to a human.\nMost puppies will imprint on their chosen humans during their early developmental phases, between seven and 12 weeks of age, but older dogs can still form a strong bond with people.\nMost puppies will imprint on their chosen humans during their early developmental phases, between seven and 12 weeks of age, but older dogs can still form a strong bond with people.\nIf you want to strengthen your bond with your pup, make sure their needs are met and spend quality time with them.\nIf you want to strengthen your bond with your pup, make sure their needs are met and spend quality time with them.\nFAQs\nA puppy might imprint on the person who is providing them with the most care during their early development. That person offers them security and is someone they trust. Older dogs will often choose the person who spends the most time with them.\nDepending on life circumstances and how much time a person spends with a dog, a pup’s bond with them can strengthen. For example, your partner may be your dog’s go-to person because they worked from home and cared for the dog more. But if you now work from home, too, this extra time with your dog can help strengthen the relationship between the two of you.\nAlthough many trainers (and allergists) might not recommend that you let your dog sleep in your bed, experts now suggest that sleeping with your dog can increase the bond with your pup. “I love that we’re reversing the question,” Dr. Dana Varble, chief veterinary officer for the North American Veterinary Community,told CNN in 2021. “In general, it is a very good thing for animals to sleep with their people.” She added: “Dogs and cats who are more closely bonded with their humans get additional health benefits, including increases in beneficial neurotransmitters such as oxytocin and dopamine, the feel-good hormones.”\nThe term “velcro dog” is used to describe a dog who stays close to you and doesn’t want to leave your side. This behavior may also be described as clingy. But the latter has negative connotations — a dog who sticks to you like velcro is really just comforted by your presence.\nReferences\nReferences\nAlbuquerque, Natalia and Briseida Resende. “Dogs functionally respond to and use emotional information from human expressions.”Evolutionary Human Sciences.6 Dec 2022.https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10426098/.\nAlbuquerque, Natalia and Briseida Resende. “Dogs functionally respond to and use emotional information from human expressions.”Evolutionary Human Sciences.6 Dec 2022.https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10426098/.\n“Dogs Imprinting on Humans: What You Need to Know.”Ridgeside K9.https://ridgesidek9nc.com/dog-tips/dogs-imprinting-on-humans/.\n“Dogs Imprinting on Humans: What You Need to Know.”Ridgeside K9.https://ridgesidek9nc.com/dog-tips/dogs-imprinting-on-humans/.\n“Positive Reinforcement Training.”The Humane Society of the United States.https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/positive-reinforcement-training.\n“Positive Reinforcement Training.”The Humane Society of the United States.https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/positive-reinforcement-training.",

  "page_content": "We can all agree that sometimes dogs do things that we find peculiar. One such behavior is following us to the bathroom. Do they go to the bathroom with us because we go with them? That sounds reasonable, but according to animal behaviorists, that is not the answer. They do, however, follow us to the bathroom due to everything from bonding to curiosity.\nBy the end of this article, you will have a clearer understanding of why your dog accompanies you to the bathroom. And if that bothers you, you’ll also learn some tips on how to change the behavior.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nTop reasons why your dog may be following you to the bathroom\nYou probably don’t wonder why your dog follows you anywhere else. But why the bathroom? Your dog has adopted this behavior for numerous reasons. Below are the most common ones.\nDogs are very social creatures and like to follow you just about everywhere you go. They see you as their pack leader and want to be close to you, even in your most private moments. They don’t know it’s a private moment. To them, it’s just another area of their home. If they tend to follow you everywhere else, why not the bathroom? They thrive on forming strong bonds with you.\nMany dogs also feel more secure when they’re near their pet parent. Following you into the bathroom adds to the security they feel when they’re near you anywhere. Over time, this bonding behavior becomes even more profound.\nWhen your dog sees you walking away into another room, they may feel anxious. And if they suffer from separation anxiety, following you into the bathroom is just an expression of what they feel when you leave home. The bathroom may seem like a short distance to you. But to your dog, it may feel like it’s an unbearable separation. Following you alleviates that anxiety.\nIn addition, some dogs are afraid of missing out. They want to be part of everything you experience, even if it seems boring to you. To them, what you’re doing is not the fun part — being with you is.\nDogs are pack animals and feel responsible for protecting the pack’s other members. Although the bathroom is not a hidden threat, it is a small, enclosed, vulnerable space. Dogs want to protect you and ensure your safety, so following you to the bathroom is an instinct for safety and protection.\nSome breeds, such as German Shepherds or Rottweilers, are especially geared toward guarding behavior. They feel they must protect you from hidden (or imaginary) dangers by following you to the bathroom.\nDogs really like attention. When you adopted your dog, you may have found it cute when they followed you into the bathroom. You may have pet your pup, cuddled with them, or even given them a treat. Dogs are smart, and it doesn’t take long for them to catch onto the fact that following you to the bathroom comes with rewards.\nDogs are naturally curious and thoroughly enjoy exploring their surroundings regardless of where they are. The bathroom has running water, a toilet flushing, and an array of exciting objects. As puppies, they are even more curious and can be thoroughly entertained while you’re in the bathroom.\nBathrooms have many scents, from pleasant soaps, shampoos, and perfumes to other less pleasant odors. Dogs are known for their keen senses of smell, and following you to the bathroom could offer them a very exciting experience. It could also give them information about their surroundings.\nFollowing you to the bathroom is a habit for your pup. If your dog has been with you a long time and accompanying you to the bathroom has been something they have always done, it’s probably become a habit. Dogs thrive on predictability.\nThey are thecutestlittle shadow.\nHow to manage or modify this behavior\nIf you find your dog’s bathroom behavior cute or affectionate, you may be perfectly happy leaving them alone. However, if you’d rather have your personal space, here are some tips tomodify this behavior.\nIgnore your dog when they follow you to the bathroom. If they are seeking attention and you don’t reward them, they will learn there’s nothing in it for them.\nIgnore your dog when they follow you to the bathroom.

It also attracts pollinators like butterflies and bees. Catnip is native to Europe and Asia and has become a common ornamental plant for homes in North America. Before the development of many modern medications,Nepeta catariawas used to make juices, teas, and tinctures for human consumption. Nepetalactone is the substance in catnip that induces the euphoric response in cats.\nIs catnip safe for dogs?\nAccording to veterinarian and Kinship Collective member Dr. Lindsey Wendt, catnip is as safe for dogs as it is for felines. There have yet to be any studies revealing health benefits specifically in dogs, but broader investigations have shown that catnip can have anti-inflammatory properties; help get rid of microbes, bacteria, and parasites; and protect the liver in certain cases of drug-related injury. Catnipessential oilhas been shown to repel 13 families of insects, in some cases 10 times better than DEET.\nDuuuude...where are the mosquitos?\nHealth benefits of catnip\nCatnip has been used to help with human ailments for ages, but it’s not clear if all (or any) or these benefits translate to dogs. Some possible health benefits of catnip include:\nCatnip can make cats excited and active, but may have a mild sedative effect in some dogs. Catnip tea has been used for its calming effect on people. Catnip’s potential calming effect on dogs has not been studied or proven, but there are anecdotal reports of its calming effect.\nThe nepetalactones in catnip are similar to valepotriates, which are the compounds found in valerian root. Valerian root has been used to help some dogs with mild anxiety. Some people take valerian root to help treat their insomnia, but it's unknown if any drowsiness can be expected in dogs.\nIn the past, catnip has been used as a remedy for gastrointestinal issues in people. It was used to calm intestinal spasms, which could provide relief from diarrhea, cramping, and gas. Because catnip contains essential oils, dogs may experience the opposite effect and develop loose stool or other GI signs if they ingest too much.\nOne studyshowed that essential oils from catnip had an antimicrobial effect against multiple bacteria commonly found in canine skin infections. Other studies found that extracts fromNepeta deflersiana, a species closely related toNepeta cataria, was shown to weaken cancer cells.\nEssential oils and nepetalactones from catnip have been shown torepel mosquitoeswith the same (or higher) efficacy as DEET, depending on the concentration used.\nHow might catnip affect dog behavior?\nDogs experience the effects of catnip differently than cats do. Chani Ronez, founder ofMerci Collective, explains that their reactions are often nearly opposites. “Catnip is an herb from the mint family that cats are particularly sensitive to,” she says. “When cats are exposed to catnip, it causes them to become more active and playful and leads them to a feeling of pure bliss and euphoria. For dogs, however, it’s totally different in that it offers a sense of relaxation and calm.”\nIn general, you can expect to see these results in 30 to 60 minutes. So, if there are particular situations you want to support your dog through with catnip, such as relievinganxietyat the vet, this time frame is helpful to keep in mind.\nShould you give catnip to your dog?\nCatnip hasn’t been proven to have significant benefits in dogs, but giving them a taste shouldn’t cause any harm. You may not see any difference in your dog’s demeanor. If it makes your dog chill out a bit — that’s a bonus.\nDespite catnip’s uses in human health, catnip should only be used as a supplement. Though it may be helpful in certain situations, catnip should not be given to dogs as a replacement for vet-prescribed sedatives, antibiotics for skin infections, or heartworm prevention.\nMerci Collective founder Chani Ronez on her new collection of crystal and catnip-infused toys for cats.\nHow should I give catnip to my dog?\nDr. Wendt adds that it’s important to start nice and slow. You want to be able to see how your individual dog responds to catnip and determine whether it is a good option for them. If you start with a small amount and your dog really likes it, you can consider increasing the amount slowly using the following guidelines:\n1/8 tablespoon for small-breed dogs\n1/8 tablespoon for small-breed dogs\n1/4 tablespoon for medium-sized dogs\n1/4 tablespoon for medium-sized dogs\n1/2 tablespoon for large dogs\n1/2 tablespoon for large dogs\n“A little goes a long way!” Dr. Wendt says. “More is not necessarily better — consider offering it a few times a week rather than on a daily basis.”\nThere are lots of ways to integrate catnip into your pup’s routine. Dr. Wendt recommends sprinkling some into asnuffle mator another engaging toy that encourages foraging. “Scentwork is a great option for dogs with mobility issues, as cognitive stimulation is just as important as physical,” she says.\nDr. Wendt cautions that you shouldn’t give your dog a toy that is made for cats — this is more likely to lead to a situation of excessive exposure and toxicity, as well as potential foreign body ingestion.Merci Collective’s Chouchouis a catnip-filled chew toy made for anxious pups and one of the only dog-specific catnip toys on the market.\n“We were very mindful of what materials we used in designing the Chouchou,” Chani says. “We went with a heavyweight canvas that is made of 100 percent cotton to ensure it’s strong, natural, and free of chemicals and harsh dyes. We use an eco-friendly stuffing that is hypoallergenic and made of recycled materials.” She adds, “Our catnip is super strong, grown in North America, and free of pesticides, and the toy is printed, cut, stuffed, and assembled in Los Angeles.”\nDr. Wendt also recommends Rx Vitamins Nutricalm for dogs andReal Mushrooms Relax Pet Chews.\nWhat potential risks or other concerns should I know about before giving catnip to my dog?\nIf your dog is already taking a prescription sedative, anti-anxiety, or anti-seizure medications, be sure to check with your veterinarian before giving them catnip. Dr. Wendt says you should avoid using catnip essential oil without the direction of a veterinarian; it can cause skin irritation and is more likely to cause toxicity.\nShe warns that catnip is like any herb or supplement and can be harmful if ingested in excessive quantities. But keeping portions incremental and appropriate for your dog’s size should be completely safe. Soon, your best pal (and you, as a result) will be chillin’ more than ever.\nFinal thoughts: Is catnip safe for dogs?\nCatnip is safe for dogs and may have a soothing effect that can help ease some dogs’ anxiety. Some dogs won’t experience any change in behavior, though. If you want to give your dog catnip, start with a small amount and see how they tolerate it. Talk to your vet first if your dog is already on sedatives or seizure medications.\nFAQs\nCatnip tends to have theopposite effect in catsversus dogs. Cats will experience excitement and euphoria, while dogs may experience mild sedation.\nCatnip can be used to take the edge off and reduce mild anxiety in some dogs.

Give your dog 1/8 (small dog) to 1/2 tablespoon (large dog) and monitor to see how they tolerate it.\nReferences\n“Nepeta Cataria (Catmint, Catnip, Catswort) | North Carolina Extension Gardener Plant Toolbox.”Plants.ces.ncsu.edu, plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/nepeta-cataria/.‌\n“Nepeta Cataria (Catmint, Catnip, Catswort) | North Carolina Extension Gardener Plant Toolbox.”Plants.ces.ncsu.edu, plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/nepeta-cataria/.‌\nGrognet J.

    "title": "Why You Should Do Breathwork With Your Dog—Really",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/breathwork-dogs"

  "page_content": "Here’s your unsolicited health tip for the new year: Breathwork is not only good for us, it’s also good for the animals around us. I bet you’d agree that’s awesome news if you aren’t thinking,I’m good at breath, and I’m good at work — is that breathwork?\nNot exactly. At its most basic, breathwork is breathing intentionally. I describe it as active meditation, which is great for the herding-dog-type of humans out there who always need something to do, even when we’re supposed to be relaxing. (Umm, guilty as charged.) Breathwork is a mindfulness practice that can bring about a sense of grounding, boost energy, help identify and regulate emotions, release tension, and clarify thoughts. It can last for two minutes or 45 minutes — it’s not about the quantity but the quality of your breathing. You know, that thing that’s constantly happening and keeping us alive, whether we pay attention to it or not?\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nBefore we go further on the explain-train, could you do me a favor? Sit next to your dog and close your eyes… oh wait, you can’t read with your eyes closed, forget that. Open your eyes. Still, if it feels comfortable, take a deep and slow inhale through your nose, then exhale all the air out of your mouth. Do it again. One more time? Congratulations, you just helped your dog’s lifeandyour own.\nFor real. That can count as breathwork, and that can be enough to center you. I know it might sound kind of woo-woo. I’m admittedly kind of woo-woo. But here’s why: When I show up more aware and awake, when I’ve tended to my own wellbeing, I show up better for the dogs in my life, both my own and dogs I’m fostering. Technically, breathwork is a self-care tool, but it’s also something we can do for our dogs and for our relationship with them.\nBreathwork is good for your dog.\nSharing presence with someone can be an act of love. Serenading dogs or setting up a candlelight dinner might not cut it, but doing breathwork together is “dropping in” to meet them in the moment where they are. Generally, pups don’t carry around a past they dwell in or a future they worry about. They don’t slip into a time that is not happening now the way we humans do. Isn’t that what we appreciate most about our pets, how present they are? Breathwork offers a portal to join them there.\nIt feels comforting to sense somebody there, really there in the room with you. Dogs can feel our presence, they sense when our focus includes them or not. Just ask any dog walker who whips out their phone to check text messages how that impacts the other end of the leash. “Dogs understand eye contact. They understand when we are regarding them,” saysLaura London, professional dog trainer, licensedFamily Pawseducator, and certified canine massage practitioner. “When we regard somebody, they have identity,” London adds.\nLondon tells me dogs today are less scent-oriented than their ancestors. They no longer need to forage for food or where to sleep, so they no longer use their noses the way they were made to be used. In her opinion, this is a contributing factor to a rise in behavioral challenges. Theolfactory formation in dogsis designed with far more advanced functioning than is the case in humans. “When dogs use their noses more, they breathe more, and when they breathe more, they take in more information that can help them calm down. It’s why nosework is so powerful. Breathwork issort of like noseworkfor humans,” London points out.\nIn my experience, breathwork allows people to slow down and realize what they’re thinking in their heads and feeling in their bodies. This noticing sends a message to ourselves that we count. And once we know how to give this level of regard to ourselves, we can give it more easily to our pets, elevating the sense of inherent worth in both of us. On top of the fact that when we breathe mindfully beside our dogs we share the moment with them and give them loving attentiveness, we also acknowledge them giving the same back to us, recognizing the value they add in our lives.\nAnother reason breathwork is good for dogs?\nWhen we’re balanced instead of stressed, it sets the stage for improved behavior from our dogs and increases the likelihood that any training we do with them sticks. Ourserenity makes dogs more eagerto engage with us and follow our lead. “Dogs learn through association and context, so if you change your behavior, the association a dog has with you changes, and you can get a different relationship with different results. It’s why a dog is OK with one person and their particular speed, energy, and breath, but not OK with another person,” London tells me. “Generally, dogs prefer a calmer energy. I tell my clients, it’s not about the dog. People are my real clients, and mostly I have to teach them about the art of doing nothing. Showing their dog how to chill. That’s the thing.”\nDoing breathwork with your dog is a way to chill with your dog. It allows a dog to associate peace with their person, and a person to associate peace with their dog. The payoff can be huge in terms of our dogs’ overall demeanor (and our own).\nBreathwork is good for you.\nLet’s take a breathwork break. Inhale deeply but through the mouth this time, and exhale slowly through the mouth, too. Continue that breath pattern.\nFYI, when you do this, you’re also taking in more oxygen. Duh, you probably know that, but when we breathe fully, we nourish our bodies and brains with more air. Moreair usually translatesinto a less foggy mind and a greater aptitude in our muscles. When we are lost in unaware negative thinking spirals, we tend to breathe shallower and faster, causing less oxygen to get in, which means less nourishment for us, which means less clarity of the mind and less capacity for the body.Remember the age-old airplane analogy which insists we put our own oxygen mask on first? We have to be breathing to be at our best, and only then can we help anyone else.\nFellow certified trauma-informed breathwork facilitator,Brenda Winkle, who is also a certified trauma-informed somatic coach, energy healer and trauma-informed Reiki Master, tells me, “One of the benefits of doing breathwork with a facilitator is that youget to experience co-regulation.” That’s a term used to describe the process of supporting someone as they navigate emotions by offering them a nonjudgmental environment. Co-regulation ushers in connection, a witnessing container, and creates a blanket of trust. When we breathe with our dogs, they in essence co-regulate with us.\nMany emotions may arise during breathwork, whether that be anger, sadness, grief, joy, or something else, because intentional breathing can help move energy. “Co-regulation produces a sense of safety in the body,” Winkle says, which may be what allows stuck emotions to process and integrate. (Translation from woo-woo speak: It feels safe to process emotions in the presence of somebody who cares and isn’t trying to fix or control you.)\nPhysical symptoms like lightheadedness, temperature change, and tingling are also common during breathwork because changing our breathing affects our body. There arephysical benefits from doing breathwork, too, ranging from lowering blood pressure to improving immune functioning to promoting restful sleep.\nThe aha moment\nWhen I started doing breathwork, I noticed how my own blind and deaf senior Pitbull, Wally, would clomp over from wherever he was in the house to push the door open with his head, plop on the rug, and lay beside me. Now as a breathwork facilitator myself, I wonder if it feels good for him to hold space for me while I’m doing breathwork, just as I enjoy to hold space for others. I believe that as I breathe intentionally, my Pittie can detect my levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, dropping. (Again, translation: My dog’s nose can actually pick up on my lowering cortisol levels.)\nWinkle agrees. “I adopted my dog, Bentley, and was a couple of months in when I did a breathwork session. As I dropped into a slow breath, Bentley dropped in beside me. He was co-breathing and co-regulating with me,” she explains. She credits regular breathwork together with helping Bentley grow more confident, overcome anxiety, and adjust, all of which have contributed to the closeness they’ve developed.\nBreathwork is good for the relationship.\nYet one more reason that I recommend doing breathwork with your dog: It is good for the relationship between you. You are working with your dog when you work on yourself. You are bonding and nurturing the love between you when you implement self-care.\nWe know dogs communicate through body language. But how often do we hear them? And how often do we communicate through our own bodies in response, purposefully and clearly? Dogs learn to read our signs, they tune into us, even when we don’t realize what we’re demonstrating. “If we go in hot and our head isn’t clear, our breathing isn’t deep and our heart rate goes up. Our dogs will spike and sync up to that stress,” London says. “You take a dog with a high frequency and meet them with a high emotional state, and that dog won’t know how to come down. We won’t be able to tell what’s going on. We have to be a thermostat and set the temperature for both of us.”\n“If we don’t like the behavior our dog is exhibiting, we can look at how we are behaving because usually there is a tie,” Winkle corroborates. “My dog responds directly to my nervous system. If I am relaxed, he is. If I am agitated, he is. When it comes to dogs, if we don’t like how they’re behaving, it’s an opportunity to look in the mirror and ask how we’re showing up in our lives. It’s hard to do and not always comfortable, but usually the dog’s behavior is a symptom.”\nPerhaps breathwork is where dog behavior and self-help can intersect. OK, I admit, that wassuperwoo woo. But hear me out: There is an overlap between us and our dogs. Our wellbeing is interconnected with the wellbeing of the animals we take care of, because what we think determines what we feel, and what we feel determines what we do. We impact one another. Maybe we breathe with our dogs to listen to them better. Using this logic, when we breathe, we talk to them.\nRespiration, inspiration, motivation, transformation\nFor those who struggle to meditate because it feels boring, breathwork can offer a nice alternative. For others, breathwork might be too intense. I invite you to get curious and experiment with wellness modalities. Search for certified facilitators who align with what you’re seeking, or use an app with a varied resource library, likeInsightTimer.\nEven if all you do is sit beside your dog and lay a hand on their belly (ifthey like that) and observe the rise and fall of their breath, and observe the same in yourself, that simple awareness of inhales and exhales could mean a lot for you, for your beloved dog, and for the dynamic you share.\nReferences\nAnastasio, Alexandra. “Keeping Calm in a Crisis: Why It’s Important for Both You and Your Dog.”American Kennel Club, May 3, 2018,www.akc.org/expert-advice/advice/keeping-calm-in-a-crisis/.\nAnastasio, Alexandra. “Keeping Calm in a Crisis: Why It’s Important for Both You and Your Dog.”American Kennel Club, May 3, 2018,www.akc.org/expert-advice/advice/keeping-calm-in-a-crisis/.\nFincham, Guy William, et al. “Effect of Breathwork on Stress and Mental Health: A Meta-Analysis of Randomised-Controlled Trials.”Scientific Reports, vol. 13, no. 1, 9 Jan. 2023,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-27247-y.\nFincham, Guy William, et al. “Effect of Breathwork on Stress and Mental Health: A Meta-Analysis of Randomised-Controlled Trials.”Scientific Reports, vol. 13, no. 1, 9 Jan. 2023,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-27247-y.\n“How Shallow Breathing Affects the Body and Mind — Calm Blog.”Calm Blog,www.calm.com/blog/shallow-breathing.\n“How Shallow Breathing Affects the Body and Mind — Calm Blog.”Calm Blog,www.calm.com/blog/shallow-breathing.\nSalamon, Maureen. “Co-Regulation: Helping Children and Teens Navigate Big Emotions.”Harvard Health, 3 Apr. 2024,www.health.harvard.edu/blog/co-regulation-helping-children-and-teens-navigate-big-emotions-202404033030.\nSalamon, Maureen. “Co-Regulation: Helping Children and Teens Navigate Big Emotions.”Harvard Health, 3 Apr. 2024,www.health.harvard.edu/blog/co-regulation-helping-children-and-teens-navigate-big-emotions-202404033030.",

  "page_content": "From champagne to parties to resolution list writing, New Year’s Eve can be lots of fun for humans. But when it comes to those gorgeous fireworks displays popping up around the country (or the amateur ones in our most adventurous neighbor’s backyard), our four-legged family members are a little less thrilled. Fireworks are a huge source of stress for dogs — and they can be a serious health hazard, too.\nYour pup deserves a joyful start to 2025, so we talked to Dr. Gabrielle Fadl, veterinarian and director of primary care atBond Vetin New York City, about the dangers of fireworks to dogs and how to keep your dog safe this holiday.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhy are dogs scared of fireworks?\nThe short answer:Loud noises can be frighteningto many dogsandcats. The booming blasts of fireworks are unpredictable and sudden, and fireworks are likely louder than most noises your pet is used to hearing. If you have a dog who’sfreaked out by thunderstorms,they will likely be scared of fireworks, too.\n“Similar to thunderstorms, fireworks causing loud, unpredictable noises can be interpreted as a threat to dogs, causing them to hide,show signs of anxiety(panting, trembling, pacing, whining), or run,” Dr. Fadl says.\nWith their bright lights and loud noises, fireworks can also createsensory overloadin animals, resulting in a panicked fight-or-flight response. Although there is no real threat, your pet doesn’t know that, and they may experience an adrenaline rush that results in rising blood pressure and a faster heart rate. This sense of danger causes some pets to attempt to escape or even react with aggression toward other animals and humans in the home.\nHow are fireworks dangerous to dogs?\nFireworks come with many risks for dogs, so it’s best to keep your pets safely inside during any New Year’s celebrations. In addition to a sense of fear and stress, dogs who are outside unattended during fireworks displays run the risk of becoming burned, injured, or even ingesting lit or used fireworks.\nFear and anxiety can lead your dog to make a run for it. “If dogs are not properly restrained, dogs can get loose and run away in an attempt to find safety,” Dr. Fadl says. “As a result, dogs can get lost or injured while attempting to climb or dig to escape these sounds.”\nEven if your dog happens to be chill about fireworks, allowing them outside while you’re lighting sparklers can be dangerous. Dogs may not realize the danger of lit fireworks and get too close, which can result in burns to the face or even the inside of the mouth if they attempt to ingest a lit firework.\n“The same precautions that you would take when using fireworks around young children should also be taken with your pets,” Dr. Fadl adds. “That means making sure fireworks are not being set off with pets nearby and able to get near hazardous sparks, flames, or strong smoke or odors.”\nHealth issues related to ingesting fireworks\nFireworks don’t even have to be lit to cause injury to your pet. When roaming the yard after a firework display, dogs may ingest debris or pieces of used fireworks, which contain dangerous chemicals, such as heavy metals, sulfur, and coloring agents. Eating fireworks can cause serious health issues for dogs, such asgastrointestinal distressor even muscle and nerve dysfunction, which can result in permanent damage.\nYou probably don’t need to worry about cats ingesting fireworks because they tend to be more discriminating eaters and likely won’t attempt to eat a used firework. But you should always clean up all used fireworks and debris in your yard before allowing your pets outside again.\nTips for comforting your pup when the storm is too loud for your pup’s comfort.\nTips for keeping your dog calm and safe during fireworks displays\nIf you know that your dog is scared of loud noises, make sure to have a plan for soothing your pet during New Year celebrations and know how to calm a dog during fireworks. Start by keeping your dog away from any nearby firework displays and safely cozied up in the house. If you live in a cold climate, your pet should be safely inside anyway, but make sure you have them in a place in the house where they feel safe when they hear loud noises.\nWell before New Year’s Eve comes around, yourpet should be microchippedand have an ID tag on their collar featuring your current contact information. No one expects their dog to run away, but fireworks can make your pet’s behavior unpredictable, so it’s best to take precautions. Ensuring your dog has proper identification can improve the chances that they will be returned to you if they do become lost.\nOne of the best ways to calm your dog during fireworks is to make a space in your home for them to feel safe and comfortable. Choose a space with no windows, like the inside of a large closet or a bathroom, and create a cozy cave where your dog can hide from the noise and lights of the fireworks. You can even use a crate if your dog already feels safe there. Give your pup some of their favorite toys and treats so they feel at home and (hopefully) more relaxed.\n“If you can, try to engage your dog in a playful or fun activity, such as a training or play session,beforethe noises are expected to begin,” Dr. Fadl suggests. “Using positive reinforcement, like rewarding calm behaviors with treats or affection, can be helpful in a sound-phobic dog.”\nSoft, soothing noises can be an antidote to the loud bangs of fireworks. Try leaving some kind of white noise — like the TV or radio — on to help cover the sounds of any firework displays and give your dog something else to focus on. You can even find soothing white noise playlists, including somespecifically designed for dogs,on YouTube and Spotify.\nYour pup might want company; leaving your pet alone during fireworks can sometimes make them even more stressed. If you can, stay home with your dog to help them feel safer and comfort them if they show signs of stress or fear. Pet your pup with long, slow strokes along the length of their body and avoid any behaviors that seem frantic. Try to keep your voice and your movements calm and reassuring to show your dog that they’re safe with you.\nThere’s nothing to fear but fear itself — and a dog who won’t stop shaking when it thunders.\nIf your pet’s anxiety is especially severe and none of the above solutions seem to help, talk to your veterinarian about other treatment options. Your dog may benefit from anti-anxiety medication, which your vet can prescribe, and you may also want to ask about over-the-counter options, like dog-calming treats, anxiety vests likeThundershirts, or CBD products. Never, ever give your dogover-the-counter medicationwithout consulting a vet, and always be sure theCBD productsyou use are completely free of THC and approved for pets.\n“Some dogs are so severely impacted by noises that anxiolytic or sedating medication may be needed to help keep them calm and prevent them from harming themselves,” Dr. Fadl says. “There are many safe options, as well as FDA-approved medication for dogs with noise aversion. Speak to your veterinarian as soon as possible about which medication may be best for your dog.”\nEven after the fireworks show is over, you still need to keep your dog safe from the possibility of poisoning. Make sure to clean up all used fireworks and any debris in your yard, whether you shot the fireworks or not, before you let your dog outside again.\nKeep your dog safe this New Year’s Day (and every day).\nFireworks may be awe-inspiring and fun for you, but they can be incredibly stressful and even dangerous to your dog. Take precautions to help your pup feel safe this holiday and have a plan to ensure that your dog avoids the hazards of fireworks and remains happy and healthy.\nReferences:\nFear of Thunderstorms and Fireworks\nFear of Thunderstorms and Fireworks\nHow to Keep Your Dog Calm During Fireworks\nHow to Keep Your Dog Calm During Fireworks\n10 Ways to Calm Your Dog During Fireworks\n10 Ways to Calm Your Dog During Fireworks\nHow to Keep Your Dog Safe During Fireworks\nHow to Keep Your Dog Safe During Fireworks",

    "title": "PDQs Are Why Your Dog Gets So Stressed When You’re About to Leave the House",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/pdqs-pre-departure-cues-dogs"
  },
  "page_content": "Does yourdog get distressedwhen you leave them alone? Do they cry or shake or act out in destructive orself-harming ways? Do they start engaging in these behaviors before you even approach the door? Like when you are brushing your teeth, putting on your shoes, turning off the TV, or rummaging in your bag?\nDogs are extremely observant creatures and their favorite thing to observe is you. Makes sense given that you control every aspect of their lives — from when they eat to when they go outside and for how long. In the course of their observations, they may come to notice that you engage in certain behaviors before you leave the house. These behaviors become what are known as pre-departure cues, or PDQs. And if your dog experiences separation anxiety or distress, they may act out whenever you engage in these behaviors, whether you actually separate from them or not.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nAlmost anything can be a PDQ if it is repeatedly performed leading up to your departure. “Routine gestures, like organizing items or gathering things to take with you, can hint to a dog that you’re preparing to leave,” says Qiai Chong, chief behaviorist atPet Coach SG. “Dogs notice PDQs because they are fully present in the moment. And this heightened awareness allows them to pick up on specific activities — including those we may perform subconsciously — and associate them with our departure.”\nPDQs only become a problem when they cause stress behavior — salivating, panting, pacing, crying, barking, shivering, etc. These behaviors might seem minor when you first observe them, but think of your dog like a wind-up toy, and the longer they engage in these stress behaviors before you leave, the more wound up they get. Then, when you’re finally gone, their wind-up key is released and they explode that anxiety all over your house by barking non-stop or tearing up the sofa.\nIf your dog has one PDQ, they’ll get wound up a little, but since you likely engage in multiple pre-departure behaviors your dog may have five or even 10. Each PDQ adds to their anxiety and makes the actual act of you leaving all the more distressing. ”Some dogs may go to great lengths to escape these feelings,” Chong says. “Sometimes, resulting in self-harming behaviors, like chewing on doors or even attempting to jump through windows.”\nHow to get PDQs under control\nFirst, you need to figure out exactly what your dog’s PDQs are. Jessica Jacobson, a dog behavior expert and certified dog trainer atDapper Dog Trainingin New York City, suggests making a list of all the things you do before leaving the house. Then you want to go through this list and see which ones actually elicit a response in your dog. “Be sure to test them separately, not in sequence,” Jacobson says. “Otherwise, you won’t know which individual actions actually trigger your dog.”\nKeep in mind that tasks may need to be broken down into smaller component parts in order for you to figure out exactly where and when your dog is being triggered and help them through it. For instance, putting on your shoes might seem like a simple task, but it actually involves a number of smaller steps: sitting down, reaching for your shoes, actually touching your shoes, putting your feet inside your shoes, lacing your shoes up, etc. And any one of these steps could be the one that triggers your dog. In order to know for sure, you need to watch your dog at every step of this process. When you notice them reacting to what you’re doing, stop. Give them time to recover, then reset and repeat the action up to that specific point until they no longer react.\n“To be effective, this action needs to be repeated multiple times during the day,” Jacobson adds. “If done correctly, your dog should become desensitized to this portion of the action within a couple of days, then you can continue to move forward with the action until you get to another point of reactivity.”\n“Repeating these actions without leaving will gradually help your dog disconnect these cues from your departure,” says Divij Gupta, a canine behaviorist and trainer atSploot. “Over time, they will feel less anxious when you truly need to go, as these cues will no longer trigger immediate stress.”\nOnce you manage to fully desensitize one action on your list, you can move on to another and another, until you’ve worked your way through all your dog’s PDQs. You will need to revisit each trigger from time to time, though, incorporating it into your daily routine with your dog at random intervals to make sure they do not become resensitized.\nAddressing your dog’s separation anxiety\nThe reason PDQs have power over your dog in the first place is because your dog has negative feelings about being left alone. So if you really want to help your dog, you have to address these feelings head on.\nFortunately, you can train your dog to be alone the same way you desensitize them to their PDQs. Chong suggests walking toward the door, then returning to your dog. If your dog doesn’t react, try putting your hand on the doorknob, turning the doorknob, opening the door, etc. At any point, if your dog begins to react, stop, allow your dog to calm down, then reset and try again. Eventually, you should get to the point where you can step outside, then close the door behind you. Stay on the other side for 10 seconds, then 20, then 30. You want to make sure that you return before your dog starts reacting. If you are gone for too long and your dog gets upset, you may have to go back a step or two to regain your progress.\nUnderstand that you may only get five minutes of focus out of them before the process itself becomes stressful. This is not a process you can rush. So, instead of dedicating half an hour to this training once a day, do three to five minutes of training three or four times a day.\n“Once your dog can comfortably manage alone time for approximately 30 minutes, you can begin to re-introduce one PDQ at a time,” Chong says. “It’s normal for there to be some regression in duration during this phase, as the intensity of the perceived separation increases. The key is to introduce each PDQ slowly, allowing your dog to adjust, and then gradually build back their alone time.”\nWhatnotto do\nDealing with PDQs and separation issues can be extremely frustrating, but do your best to remain calm, even if your dog does something upsetting like chewing on your shoes or ripping a hole in the couch. “Punishment can intensify the aversive emotions your dog is already experiencing,” Chong says. “Instead of helping, it can lead to increased anxiety and fear, making the situation worse.”\nDon’t just put them in a crate, either. “While crate training can help dogs feel secure in a confined space, the goal here is to help your dog feel comfortable being left alone, not just in a crate,” Chong says. “These are two different processes and trying to accomplish too much at once can set your dog up for failure and increase their anxiety.”\n“Don’t make a big fuss when leaving or returning home,” Gupta adds. “That could also end up heightening your dog’s anxiety.” Remember that the goal of this training is to calm your dog when you are preparing to leave them. This may require that you allow yourself more time in the morning so you can slow down a little and leave peacefully instead of rushing around in a last-minute tornado of your own anxiety, which will only rile your dog up, too.\nJacobson also suggests that you not take your dog for a walk or cuddle them right before you leave. That might seem counterintuitive, but walks and affection can be very stimulating for a dog and if you leave them alone right after you’ve gotten them excited, you could be supercharging their anxiety. Better to wait a bit until they have calmed down before you head out.\n“Don’t give them food before leaving either,” Chong says. “While some people may think counterconditioning through treats can help,research showsthat this approach is not actually effective for separation-related behaviors. In fact, giving your dog food right before you leave can heighten their anticipation of your departure, potentially increasing their anxiety when you go.”\nWhen should you seek professional help?\n“Separation anxiety and PDQs are really complicated issues,” Jacobson says. ”And dealing with them can leave people feeling trapped in their own homes.” If that’s how you’re feeling, seek help immediately. You don’t have to do this alone, and as helpful as the tips above may be, each dog is different and dog trainers and behaviorists are able to observe your dogs in a way you can’t. They can also offer suggestions tailored to your dog that you might never even have thought of.\n“Sometimes, what looks like separation anxiety to a dog parent is actually something completely different,” says Jacobson, who often finds that adjustments to a dog’s environment are enough to alleviate behaviors otherwise attributed to separation. So, don’t assume you can diagnose the problem. And don’t feel bad if you can’t seem to help your dog on your own. Training can be a financial hardship, but it is an investment in your dog’s wellbeing and your relationship that will pay big dividends.",

  "page_content": "Have you ever been walking around your house, minding your human business, when your dog lets out a huge, dramatic AF sigh? Seriously, these dogs are exasperating — as if they have to go to a job and pay bills and remember dentist appointments!\nBut before you spend 20 minutes lecturing your dog on being grateful for their pampered lifestyle, keep in mind that dogs do, in fact, get stressed. Although they don’t often communicate this emotion through sighing (most of the time they are literallyjust breathing), stress in dogs can manifest in pacing, panting, and whining.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWe asked both animal behaviorists and human psychologists howyoucan deal with leaving your dog home alone.\nLongterm stress can also result in destructive or dangerous behaviors and affect both your pup’s and your own quality of life. Stress in dogs can be triggered by pain, separation anxiety, boredom, and more. Most importantly our dogs’ stress should be taken seriously — even if they are an unemployed mooch of a pooch.\nAfter taking the necessary steps to address the root cause of your dog’s anxiety, a great way to help your dog channel their stress is through toys that engage stress relieving behaviors like licking, chewing, and mental enrichment. No matter the toy you select to help relax your pup, each one should follow a very simple rule.\nIf your dog loses their sh*t over anything—from a squirrel to a guest. Here are some tips to curtail that.\n“All of these toys should allow your dog to ‘win,’” says trainer, pet lifestyle expert, and Kinship Expert Collective memberNicole Ellis. Ellis goes on to say that stress toys should bede-stressing — notdistressing. “It is important to ensure dogs don’t get frustrated or stressed with toys. The goal is to have them win and stay engaged.” With that in mind, here are Kinship’s picks for the best toys for chillaxing to the max.\nBtw, our editors (and their pets) picked out these products. They’re always in stock at the time we publish, but there’s a chance they’ll sell out. If you do buy through our links, we may earn a commission. (We’ve got a lot of toys to buy over here, you know?)\nGot a dog who needs a more energetic outlet for releasing their demons? This unique toy is for the burrowers who enjoy a quick dig before their snack. With the iDig, dog parents can hide toys and treats under the toy’s flap, and pups can dig their way to their prize.\n“The iDig is one of my dog’s favorite toys; it provides mental enrichment [from] finding the toys and treats mixed with the physical element of digging (which is a natural innate desire of dogs),” Ellis says. “I find mine often goes to sleep in the iDig once he’s done. It’s our go-to when he needs to get some anxious energy out.”\nYou can never go wrong with a classic! This lick mat is a great choice for directing your fretful dog’s attention toward something fun! A largely unchallenging toy, this mat is perfect for high-stress situations, when your dog is more likely to be distracted.\nThis frozen treat toy might as well be an icy piña colada for our frazzled pups. Fill and freeze The Pupsicle with your pup’s favorite treat mixture and watch your dog’s brow unfurrow. In addition, this treat is perfect for dogs struggling withseparation anxiety; it can last up to 40 minutes.\nA lot of dogs are tough chewers on their best days, and an anxious day is only going to increase that urge to chomp. To help your chew boo relax, we recommend this treat-holding toy by Qwizl, specifically designed for aggressive chewers. This toy can be paired with anything from bully sticks to spreadable treats to make a fun, challenging game out of snack time.\nIfcrate trainingis bringing your dog down, consider this training-aid toy from Diggs. Specifically designed to create a positive association between your pup and the crate, this toy utilizes a pretty simple design. Step one: cover toy in lickable treat (peanut butter, honey, etc). Step two: attach toy to crate. Step three: have your dog lick the treat inside the crate and let the de-stressing ensue.\n“I love seeing dogs that are anxious in the crate go from licking the Groov toy for a few sessions to relaxing in the crate on their own. [Then, they have] their own safe spot in the home when they need some quiet time to decompress,” Ellis adds.\nSnuffle mats are ubiquitous as the go-to enrichment toy, but did you know this type of toy can help your pup reach some serious calm? We especially like this one by Injoya that combines snuffling with licking — two behaviors proven to relax our pups. Or, if you are a family that’s more into dairy than peanut butter, try Injoya’spizza snuffle mat.\nA puzzle for your puzzled pet, perhaps? This Amazon favorite is great for times of boredom and stress (fun fact:Boredomcan even cause stress in a dog!). Just make sure you know your dog’s, how shall we say, intellectual-interest level before setting this down in front of them. A dog not interested in more academic pursuits might find this puzzle too challenging to be fun. However, a dog who feels stressed by a lack of stimulation (looking at you, working and herding dogs), will gravitate to this puzzle toy.\nAll pup parents know the golden rule:Kong is king. All hail Kong! Kong toys have long been the godsend for dog parents dealing with separation anxiety, boredom, and the simple desire to watch Netflix and take a bubble bath in peace. As much as the Kong is a solve for those issues, it’s even better for de-stressing your pup. A perfect combination of treat and puzzle, the Kong is a stress toy that all dogs can enjoy — especially as they come in different sizes and rubber types to best fit your dog’s needs.\nEllis wholeheartedly believes in the power of the Kong: “Most dogs go back to the Kong multiple times throughout the day, which I love. The shape of the Kong gives the [dog the] ability to hold the Kong and just lick it and allows them to settle in a spot, while the fun shape can allow them to roll it and chase it. [This helps] them explore new areas that may be causing stress and anxiety.”\nIf you have tried all the treat toys and puzzles under the sun, and your pup still can’t find their center, consider going a different route with the Snuggle Puppy. The Snuggle Puppy uses low heat and a heartbeat function to mimic a companion for your anxious dog. Many users rave about this toy being a game changer separation anxiety andcrate training, which can be some of the most stressful situations for pups.",

    "title": "Is Your Dog Scared of Stairs? Here’s How to Help Them Get Over It",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/dog-scared-of-stairs"
  },
  "page_content": "For even the most health-conscious human willing to bypass an elevator to get their steps in, stairs are an annoying but innocuous fact of life. But for some dogs, a flight of stairs might as well be Mount Everest. They come, they stare, and they do not conquer. This can become very frustrating for those of us who live, say, on the fourth floor of an apartment building that doesn’t even offer theoptionof an elevator. What’s a pet parent to do when that Great Dane puppy grows into a 150-pound statue who refuses to leave the ground floor?\nWhether you’retraining a new puppyor helping a reluctant adult dog overcome their fear, the right techniques will have your dog scaling those steps in no time. As with most training, the key is to be patient, methodical, and keepplenty of treatson-hand. Whowouldn’tlearn to love the stairs if there’s a free snack at the top? Here, some training tips from two certified experts to help your dog master the ultimate vertical trial.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nYour puppy training schedule, from eight weeks to six months. Let’s do this.\nWhy are some dogs afraid of stairs?\nFear of stairs is not overly common in adult dogs who’ve lived inside homes before, says Laurie Lawless, certified dog behavior consultant and owner ofShelter Behavior Integrations. Most often, she says, “I see it when dogs just have not been overly socialized, have not lived inside previously, or are just sensitive and fearful to a new environment.”\nSometimes, dogs’ anxiety might stem from thekindsof stairs you have in your home. Older houses, in particular, tend to have narrow or steep staircases, which can create stress or vision challenges. If the floor texture on your stairs differs from the rest of your home, that can factor in as well; some harder floors can leave dogs feeling unstable, which is less than ideal when they’re trying to climb.\nFloating stairs, which have gaps in between each step, can also scare dogs off, says Claren Mulhall, co-owner and head trainer atCloud K-9 Dog Training. From a dog’s angle, she points out, those sleek, modern steps will look like they’re full of holes. If your dog is cowering at the top or bottom, try throwing a blanket over them so that they appear solid.\n“Another consideration, and always my first consideration if I work with a dog who is afraid of stairs, is to rule out any medical causes,” Mulhall says. “A dog with knee or hip issues may be very uncomfortable or find it painful to use stairs, so they avoid them as much as possible.”\nIf your dog seems vehemently opposed to stairs, it’s worth checking with their veterinarian to make sure that their resistance is not a sign of bigger issues. The last thing you want is to make the condition worse by forcing them to push through it.\nHow can we help adult dogs who are afraid of stairs overcome their fears?\nJust like most people wouldn’t love to learn how to swim by being thrown into a freezing cold swimming pool, it’s important to be gradual and deliberate when training your dog to deal with stairs. Both Lawless and Mulhall emphasize the importance of starting small. (Think: starting with just one stair.) For many dogs, Mulhall adds, it might be easier to try going down the stairs first, rather than up.\n“Sit on the stairs with some yummy treats and encourage the dog to put a single paw on the step, then treat, then two paws and treat, etc.,” Mulhall says. “Don’t pull the dog up or down the stairs. Reward them with treats along the way.”\nLawless recommends throwing a treat away from the stairs after completing that same process. That little extra step can turn the exercise into a fun cat-and-mouse game while also creating an opportunity to seek consent from your dog to continue the training.\n“If you go back towards the first step and the dog doesn’t follow you, that’s a sign, to me, that the dog was a little overwhelmed, versus a dog who is like, ‘Oh, I’ll jump back on those stairs for another cookie,’” Lawless says.\nIf you don’t have stairs in your home but want to teach your dog how to handle them in other environments, you can use obstacles like blocks, large books, exercise platforms, and even your legs to get them used to the movement of picking up all their legs. Claren says that wherever you’re training, the most important thing you can do is to make sure that whatever your dog does at the end of the stairs is going to be a good time — a play session or some treats, perhaps. In other words, save theveterinarian’s front stepsfor another time.\nItispowerful enough, even for the tough cases, and itisthe best choice—here’s why.\nHow can we help puppies become comfortable around stairs?\nPuppies tend to be better at adjusting to new people, places, and things than older dogs, so if you have the chance to introduce your puppy to stairs, be sure to take advantage. If your puppy is still working on coordination and balance, Lawless recommends covering the stairs with something like a bath mat, a yoga mat, or even a roll of stair carpeting. This will ensure they don’t lose their footing. As always,treats will be your best friend.\nFrom there, Lawless recommends gently guiding your puppy up the first step or two, allowing them to take their time getting familiar with the surface. Don’t worry about the rest of the staircase just yet — wait until your puppy seems confident navigating that first step. And just like with adult dogs, let their interest be your guide. If your puppy seems reluctant to get back on, that’s probably a sign that it’s time to hit pause.\n“What we don’t want to do is force them up or down,” Lawless says. “We can definitely [overwhelm] them and then make them more fearful of the stairs. So it’s really important to not rush it.”\nToo often, Mulhall agrees, pet parents can try too much too soon. Her suggestion? “Work with what your dog can handle. Don’t try practicing with stairs when you’re in a hurry.” With young puppies especially, be mindful of theirphysical developmentto avoid overdoing things.\nDid you get a dog for emotional support and now they are the one who needs it?\nHow can I tell if training is overwhelming my dog?\nIt’s helpful to get to know all of the usual body language dogs use to convey stress, like stiff posture, darting eyes, andexcessive lip-licking. That said, there are a few specific behaviors that you might want to watch for while working with stairs.\nFirst, watch how your dog distributes their weight at the foot of the stairs. If they’re taking a step up but keep their back legs weighed to avoid putting too much weight on the step, it means that they’re not comfortable enough yet to ascend to the next step.\nStress panting is another sign to watch for. “Especially if they pant and look away from the stairs or look up at you, it means that they’re probably struggling with making that next step in a confident way,” Lawless says. “At that point, I would probably practice just teaching them to go up and down that first one or two sets of stairs with lots of treats, and doing that in very short sessions.”\nIf your home has stairs, Lawless recommends carrying your puppy up and down as needed, while they’re still in training. Don’t force your puppy to “sink or swim” by taking them all at once. The same goes for adult dogs. Avoid getting impatient and instead, focus on positively reinforcing the progress they’re making while taking things slow. If you have an extra-large dog who can’t be alone, consider sleeping downstairs with them overnight for a while as they build their skills.\n“This is a lifelong commitment,” Lawless says, “and it’s best to set yourself up for long-term success, versus forcing an issue — because that might end up putting you backwards.”\nOffering fewer treats can actually be agoodthing.\nWhen is it time to seek professional help?\nIt may be helpful to involve expert from the beginning. In addition to checking with your vet to rule out medical problems, Mulhall recommends seeking out acertified Fear Free trainerto help navigate the training process. Lawless, meanwhile, notes that for those who live on higher floors in apartment buildings with stairs, a professional can expedite the training progress and help your dog make faster progress than you might achieve on your own.\nWherever you are in your training journey, never fear. This kind of work takes time, and at times, it might feel like an uphill battle. But as the great Miley Cyrus once  said, it ain’t about how fast [your dog] gets there, ain’t about what’s waiting on the other side — it’s the climb.",

    "title": "Can Dogs Have Panic Attacks, Too?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/can-dogs-have-panic-attacks"
  },
  "page_content": "I woke up at 3 in the morning to someone staring at me. My senior rescue dog sat on the bed, shaking.\nI turned on a light and tried to soothe her with pets, but it didn’t help. Her panting was as loud as a lawnmower, and her wide eyes looked like she was having ashowdown with a ghost. After about 45 minutes, she hopped down her pet stairs to use her “emergency” wee-wee pads in the other room. It’s rare she uses them, but that night, it looked like we lived with a pack; they were completely covered in runny poop.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nI called her vet’s office at 4 in the morning to ask the overnight nurse if shethought the shaking, panting, and stomach issues were an emergency. As long as my dog hadn’t eaten anything suspicious or poisonous, she said we could wait until morning to schedule an appointment.\nBy morning, though, my 10-year-old dog, Claude, was back to normal: tail wagging on her walk, happily eating her breakfast, no upset stomach at all. But when her overnight anxiety spiked two more times, I took Claude to see her vet, who confirmed what I suspected: Claude was having panic attacks (yes, this does happen).\nPro tips for boosting the confidence of a scaredy-cat dog.\nSigns and symptoms\nA dog having a panic attack is dealing with “a toxic level of stress,” Gabrielle Johnson,certified dog behavior consultant, ofBest Life Dog Services, tells me.\n“It can be really scary, because you don’t know what’s going on, and you’re just looking at your dog who’s shaking and panting and staring at you,” Johnson says. “Dogs in that state will have difficulty processing information, smells, sights, sounds. They’re going to have difficulty responding to known cues, which can include things like their name.”\nIn most of these situations, your pup is not actually unsafe, but theybelievethey are. Physiologically, that may result in your dog:\nDrooling\nDrooling\nShaking\nShaking\nRunning around restlessly\nRunning around restlessly\nPacing\nPacing\nPanting\nPanting\nWhining or howling\nWhining or howling\nHiding or trying to escape a room\nHiding or trying to escape a room\nClinging to you for attention (when that’s not their normal vibe)\nClinging to you for attention (when that’s not their normal vibe)\nPeeing in the house\nPeeing in the house\nHaving diarrhea\nHaving diarrhea\n“It can go on for hours; it can be a few minutes,” Johnson says. “It really depends.”\nIt may happen more when there stressful events like fireworks.\nWhat causes panic attacks in dogs?\nI’ve had panic attacks myself, and I know that I have at least one trigger, but they can also happen out of the blue. A dog’s experience is pretty similar.\nIn Claude’s case, it’s still a bit of a mystery, but Johnson tells me that dogs who already have a lot of anxiety — as Claude does — could be more likely to have panic attacks. I don’t know much about the first eight years of Claude’s life (before she came to live with me), but sadly, all signs point to it not being so great.\n“A dog who has a generalized anxiety disorder is up against a bit more, versus a dog who’s generally relaxed,” Johnson says. “They might have more coping skills. They might bounce back faster.”\nBut there are also a lot of triggers that can affect any dog:\nOne study of more than 13,000 dogs found that noise sensitivity is themost common canine anxiety trait; nearly one-third of pups in the study were scared of at least one noise. Unfortunately, living in a big city with lots of noise could also contribute to panic attacks, Dr. Katie Bodkin, a veterinarian atWestside Veterinary Centerin New York City says. There are sirens, noisy neighbors, and (Claude’s nemesis) street sweepers. “It’s totally different in New York City than a dog in the country with a backyard,” Dr. Bodkin adds.\nClaude and I aren’t ready to depart for upstate just yet, so I’m grateful there are options for managing her anxiety. (After all, if a pup can make it here, they can make it anywhere — right?) But even rural and suburban dogs get the jitters: There are obvious triggers, likefireworks or thunderstorms, but an unexpected household noise (like the buzz of an appliance or the ringing of a phone) could also cause a panic attack.Some sounds can even be painful for dogs— think high-frequency ones — so it’s important to minimize the noise if that’s the trigger.\nDr. Bodkin says that she’s seen a lot more anxious dogs after people started returning to the office post-pandemic.Doggy daycare or a sittermay be a good salve for some dogs, but it’s not a fit for everyone, depending on location, budget, and how your pup gets along with friends. (The last thing you want is for it to backfire and make themmorenervous.)\nCaryn Self Sullivan, who has a PhD in animal behavior and runs Beach Paws Boutique in Colonial Beach, Virginia, says that most of the panic attacks she sees in dogs are due toseparation anxiety.\n“If you’re walking your dog, and they’re afraid of other dogs, or they’re afraid of certain sounds, generally… you can get your dog out of that situation pretty quickly,” Sullivan says. “The reason I think we see it so much in separation anxiety is because nobody’s watching the dog. Nobody sees what’s going on.”\nDoes your dog freak out when you head for the door? Here’s some advice.\nThat’s why she recommends in-home cameras for all her clients; together, they try to piece together the dog’s “time threshold,” or how long until the panic attack starts. She then works with clients to “build” that time.\n“I’ve started people on not even leaving the house, just going to the door and pretending like they’re going to leave and coming back, until the dog will tolerate that without starting to get upset,” Sullivan says, adding that treatment varies and can require different exercises and reassessments. “Basically, we’re teaching the dog it’s safe to be alone. They don’t have to panic.”\n“The other thing we don’t have a lot of good information on is PTSD in dogs,” Johnson says, explaining that our human diagnostic tools don’t work with dogs. “For example, we can’t ask dogs if they have nightmares. But it is definitely, I suspect, probably underdiagnosed.”\nImagine having a scary pain — like a muscle cramp — and not understanding what it is. “[A trigger] could be something physiological,” Sullivan says. In some cases, a dog’s reaction to that pain could cause their anxiety to ramp into overdrive and cause a panic attack.\nSometimes, it’s just a medical mystery.\n“It could be a smell; their sense of smell is so much better than ours,” Johnson says. “Sometimes we’re just not perceiving [the trigger]. The trigger is there. It’s tangible. But we don’t know what it is.”  A vet visit or confinement could also trigger an attack. A bad dream is another possibility, Sullivan adds, as are othernighttime stressors.\nResearch also suggests a possible linkbetween gut health and anxietyin dogs; the gut-brain relationship is already well-established in humans.\nDiagnosis and treatment\nAccording to Dr. Bodkin, it’s important to rule out physical causes before diagnosing a dog with anxiety or, more specifically, panic attacks. She says it can also be helpful for pet parents to bring documentation, such as a video, so that a vet can see exactly what’s going on.\nOnce your vet has ruled out anything physical, they might prescribeanti-anxiety medication, like Dr. Bodkin did for Claude. Claude takes Trazodone (an antidepressant with sedative properties) as well as Clomicalm (often referred to as “doggie Prozac” — dogs, they’re just like us!).\nHow to cope with dog anxiety—from training to medication.\nCommon medications include:\nTrazodone\nTrazodone\nClomicalm (clomipramine)\nClomicalm (clomipramine)\nReconcile (fluoxetine)\nReconcile (fluoxetine)\nSileo (a gel specifically for noise aversion)\nSileo (a gel specifically for noise aversion)\nHuman medications that may be used off-label\nHuman medications that may be used off-label\n“Medication can play a huge role,” Johnson says, explaining that it’s ideal if you know what your dog’s trigger is and can administer any sedating medications ahead of time. “We can lessen the damage done by the panic attack, and we might see them bounce back faster.”\nIn more severe cases,medications may be takendaily, as in Claude’s case. For other dogs, it might be a temporary solution while they work on behavior modification.\nDepending on your pup’s situation, your vet may also recommend a certified trainer, behavior expert, or veterinary behaviorist who can help your dog reduce their fear.\nThe goal is to decrease the dog’s physiological response to the stressor, to increase theirability to self-regulate, and to boost their resilience, so that they’re bouncing back from the panic attack faster with less and less support from their pet parent, Johnson adds.\n“They’re taking a few minutes to self-regulate, instead of it potentially ruining their day or week or even month,” Johnson says. “So, we’re finding ways to increase the dog’s ability to have control, or to perceive that they have control over their life. “We’re also doing things to change emotional responses. A really simple example would be, ‘Oh, [the sound of] fireworks actually equal [the sound of] popcorn [in the dog’s mind], not death,’ you know? So, you work to change that.”\nIt’s important to find a trainer who usespositive reinforcement(no yelling or shock collars, for example) methods, who you feel comfortable with, and who has theproper degree or certification.\nCan you help prevent a panic attack in dogs?\nIf your dog has a known trigger, the easiest way to avoid a panic attack is to take steps to avoid that trigger. But that’s not always practical — or possible (for example, you can’tcontrol a thunderstorm). Having medications on hand to take before the event is a good way to lessen the chance of your pup panicking.\nHow to help a dog with panic attacks\nIt’s a wild world we live in, and there’s nothing better than compassion. Put yourself in your dog’s shoes — erm, booties. Your dog is just as confused and scared as you would be if you were having a panic attack.\nTake a moment to collect yourself, thenoffer support. Petting, hugging, or brushing your dog is fine, as long as touch is not a trigger.\nHow could you be angry when your bestie is terrified? What’s more, it will get you nowhere. “[Dogs] don’t understand why you’re yelling at them,” Dr. Bodkin says. “They learn much more through positive reinforcement.”\nTips for comforting your pup when the storm is too loud for your pup’s comfort.\nSticking to a routine at home canhelp a dog feel more in control, thereby lessening their anxiety. Claude has the same routine every single day, and knowing what to expect helps keep her anxiety in check.\nAlong with medication, a routine has really helped her anxiety, and she hasn’t had a panic attack in months.\nDr. Bodkin says that in New York City, she often sees dogs who needmoreexercise. On the other hand, Sullivan says some dogs gettoo muchstimulation. A trained professional can evaluate which camp, if either, your dog falls into.\nMany dogs feel safe in a crate that they are free to come and go in, Dr. Bodkin says. Claude has multiple “tent beds” around the apartment so that she can hide away whenever she wants. It’s important that your dog doesn’t feel confined, which can worsen their anxiety.\nMental stimulation has been shown to helpease dogs’ anxiety, so make sure your dog has plenty of toys, puzzles, and other fun stuff to keep them entertained.\nBefore you take the medication route, there’s nothing wrong with trying out some supplements (although it’s a smart idea to run these by your vet before experimenting with them).\nSupplements come in chews, tablets, capsules, or liquids. Some common ingredients include:\nL-theanine\nL-theanine\nMelatonin\nMelatonin\nChamomile\nChamomile\nValerian root\nValerian root\nL-tryptophan\nL-tryptophan\nL-theanine\nL-theanine\nCBD\nCBD\nDogs also respond strongly to scents, and one study shows thatlavender and chamomilehave soothing effects. You can buy a lavender spray, for example, to spritz when your dog is feeling anxious.\nWhat conditions can mimic a panic attack?\nAccording to Dr. Bodkin, it’s important to rule out conditions such as epilepsy, high blood pressure, or even (in very rare cases) a brain tumor, to make sure there’s not a physiological reason behind your dog’s anxiety. Your vet will also look for thyroid or adrenal issues.\nWhen to seek professional help\nThe first time you notice the signs of a panic attack in your dog, call your vet to see what they recommend. A panic attack doesn’t necessarily happen just once and then go away, so the sooner you try to lessen their frequency, the better.  How long does treatment normally take? “I tell people to think in terms of months, not weeks or years,” Sullivan says.\nOne of the biggest mistakes we can make is not reading our dog’s body language, she adds. “Most people don’t think of them as being as complex as they are. ‘Oh, it’s just a dog. He’ll be fine, right?’ They don’t understand the complexity of dogs.”\nAt the end of the day, your dog is always there for you — why not be there for them? Even if most dogs aren’tregisteredemotional support animals, they’re still the best emotional support we’ve got in this world (along with weighted blankets and rose-petal tea). It’s our duty to support them emotionally too.\nThe fact is, our dogs have always got our backs, and we should have theirs, especially when they’re scared and need us the most.\nReferences:\nThe Influence of Olfactory Stimulation on the Behaviour of Dogs Housed in a Rescue Shelter\nThe Influence of Olfactory Stimulation on the Behaviour of Dogs Housed in a Rescue Shelter\nAnxious Behavior: How to Help your Dog Cope With Unsettling Situations\nAnxious Behavior: How to Help your Dog Cope With Unsettling Situations\nAnxiety in Dogs\nAnxiety in Dogs",

  "page_content": "Few nights of the year torture my anxious dog more than Halloween. A nervous creature already prone to barking at the faintest noise in our apartment hallway, for her, this holiday is basically an overstuffed candy bag full of triggers. She hates the foot traffic. She never gets used to the constantly ringing doorbell. And don’t even get herstartedon the crowds outside when we take her downstairs for her last walk of the night.\n“Imagine going for your usual morning walk and suddenly seeing a 30-foot blow-up cat in a yard that wasn’t there yesterday, without having any concept or understanding of Halloween,” Kristi Jones certified dog trainer and owner Mind Your Manners Pet Training, LLC, says. “It’s no wonder dogs can be on edge.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhat’s a sympathetic pet parent to do?\nNo matter the issue, there’s a lot we can do to help prepare our dogs for the big night. I asked two experts — Jones and Kirsten Kraljevic, a professional dog trainer with 35 years of experience — to give me the rundown of everything dogs hate about Halloween, and how best to help them.\nAKA a night that won’t turn into a scary time at the emergency vet.\nThings your dog hates about Halloween\nStrange objects can be scary — especially if they move, light up, or make noise. To help your dog deal, Jones recommends letting them watch you set everything up. “If you have motion-activated decor, inside or outside, turn off the motion detector when not in use so your dog isn’t startled every time they just try to walk to the water bowl or go outside,” Jones says. Let your dogs check out any new objects on their own terms.\nAnd as for all of the spooky lawn decorations around the neighborhood? Don’t force your dogs to interact with anything they don’t seem to like; instead, let them investigate new objects during walks on their own terms wherever it’s safe to do so. Jones recommends giving curious dogs about five to 10 seconds to check out new sights. “After about 10 seconds, if they aren’t ready to move on themselves, they may be mentally stuck, like a deer caught in headlights, and guiding them away with a treat may be helpful,” she says.\nIf your dog is accustomed to long, quiet walks and isafraid of kids, Halloween is rough. Try walking your dog or taking them out to play earlier in the day, before all the superheroes and movie monsters take to the streets. As Kraljevic puts it, “A tired dog is often a calmer dog.”\nThis isn’t just about keeping your dog calm; it’s also about safety. Even ifthey’re microchipped,Jones recommends keeping your dog’s collar on with a tag or even some painters tape with their name and your contact information. Make sure the contact information on both their tag and microchip is up to date and keep a current photo on hand in case they get lost. As Jones points out, “A picture showing a shaggy dog isn’t very helpful if they’ve just been shaved at the groomer.”\nWhile walking outside during and after Halloween, keep an eye out for stray candy. Jones warns that sugar-free candies and chewing gum contain Xylotol, also known as birch sugar, which, like chocolate, is highly toxic to dogs. If your dog eats any of these sweet treats, consult with your veterinarian or call theASPCA poison control hotline.\nScarier thanHalloween Kills.\nEven the most calm and sociable dogs might find themselves stressed on Halloween night. “Constant foot traffic and strangers coming to the door can make dogs feel like their territory is being invaded, leading to protective or fearful behavior,” Kraljevic says. To your dog, the stranger danger is real.\nThis holiday is the second-most prolific day (following the Fourth of July) of the year for lost pets for a reason, Joan says: “Even pets who are usually very friendly with people can get spooked by kids who don’t look or act as they normally do, and sometimes, they may bolt out of the door and become disoriented and scared very quickly.” That’s why it’s crucial to keep their collar and tags on at all times.\nIf repeated doorbell ringing makes your dog anxious, take steps before and after the actual night of Halloween to help them cope.\nBefore the big day, try teaching your dog some door etiquette by asking a friend or relative to ring the doorbell while you reward your dog for staying calm or retreating to a quiet place, Kraljevic says. And on actual Halloween night, Jones recommends setting up a quiet spot or room in the house with familiar bedding and lots of toys. Leave a noisy distraction like the TV or radio on to mask the unfamiliar sounds of the night.\nDepending on how bad your dog’s doorbell fear is, you might also consider sitting outside to greet trick-or-treaters and pre-empt the doorbell, weather permitting. As an alternative, Jones suggests keeping an eye out for approaching trick-or-treaters so you can open the door for them before they ring the bell.\nIn terms of noise, it’s not just the doorbell you have to worry about. From fireworks, to electronic decorations, to nearby house parties, Halloween spawns all sorts of sounds that can make a dog nervous. Just like with the doorbell, this approach can help to create a comfy, cozy, peaceful spot where your dog can ride out the night.\nWhatever you do, both experts advise against leaving your dog outside unattended or off leash, even in a fenced yard. Sounds like fireworks can cause them to panic and run away, even by digging under a fence. Plus, Jones points out, “people can enjoy playing pranks and you don’t want your dog to be a target of some trickster with less than good intentions.”\nFireworks and thunderstorms aren’t the only things that make them say,“No, thanks!”\nYour Morticia Addams costume might slay, but sadly, your dogs won’t get the reference. In fact, there’s a good chance that the sight of you in a long wig and unfamiliar clothes might just freak them out. The solution? It’s time for a “get ready with me” (GRWM) sesh.\n“I always suggest that people let their dogs see them dress up or dress up in stages,” Jones says. “Don’t just suddenly pop out in full costume.”\nKraljevic echoes this suggestion and adds that it can also be helpful to reward dogs for “calm exploratory behavior” while they check out your weird outfit. Just don’t take it personally if they don’t give you the compliments you deserve.\nIf seeingyouin weird clothes might freak your dog out, there’s a non-zero chance that they don’t want to wear a costume, either.\n“While we find dogs dressed in costumes cute and fun, many dogs are very uncomfortable with wearing clothes,” Jones says. “If you really want to dress them up, make sure that costumes do not restrict their movement or their breathing at all, or have pieces that can be chewed off easily. Get them acclimated to wearing the costume gradually, using lots of treats.”\nWe all want our dog to win Best Dressed at the office Halloween party, but no prize is worth making them miserable.\nHumans love shiny objects, but your dog might not be as wild about the light-up decorations, the glow sticks, and the flashlights that can go hand-in-hand with Halloween. Ahead of the holiday, Kraljevic recommends trying desensitization training to help lessen your dog’s stress around whatever triggers might set them off.\n“Ideally you would start desensitization training for Halloween way ahead of Halloween,” Kraljevic says. “Desensitization training relies on Halloween-related stimuli being introduced gradually, taking weeks if not months.”\nWhatever the flashy thing might be, introduce it to your dog slowly and offer plenty of treats and praise for neutral or happy responses.\nHave we gone too far with this Halloween dog costume thing?\nLike many of us, dogs are creatures of habit, so any shift in their usual routines, like eating and walking times, can create stress, Kraljevic says. Try to keep your activities as ordinary as possible and minimize disruptions.\nIf your dog appears stressed, Jones advises that activities like licking, chewing, and sniffing can help reduce stress hormones. She recommends distractors like long-acting chews to help them calm down after stressful events. Kraljevic also suggests enrichment activities like puzzle toys to keep their attention occupied.\nKeep your responses soothing but not over-the-top; making too much of a fuss about your dog’s anxiety can unintentionally reinforce it, Kraljevic warns. “If you’re outside, and your dog is visibly stressed, calmly remove them from the stressful situation and return home or to a quieter area.”\nShould I give my dog medication for Halloween stress?\nMost dogs can make it through Halloween without medication, Jones says, but each dog is different. If you’re considering looking into medication to help your dog manage isolated, stressful nights like Halloween, consult your vet in advance to give yourself time to try out the medication, see if it works, and adjust the dosage (with help from your vet) if needed.\nIfanti-anxiety medicationsseem too extreme, you can also speak with your vet about calming supplements or pheromone diffusers.\nHalloween can be a busy, logistics-heavy holiday, but follow these tips, and you and your dog will be dancing to “Monster Mash” in no time.",

  "page_content": "Fireworks?Very scary, obviously. Thunderstorms? Not great. Big delivery trucks? Same deal. As a dog parent, you’ve probably identified a few things that clearly trigger a stress reaction in your pup. But some common sources of stress for our dogs may not be so obvious. How our dogs experience the world can be very different from our interpretations of the world, so some things we perceive as normal or inconsequential might actually be very stressful for our pets.\nFor your dog’s short-term happiness and long-term health, it’s important to understand what stresses your dog out and how to mitigate that anxiety. We spoke with Fanna Easter, a professional dog trainer and a member of the APDT Board of Directors, and veterinary behaviorist Dr. Margaret M. Duxbury about various ways you might be stressing out your dog without realizing it.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nHow to cope with dog anxiety—from training to medication.\nCommon stress triggers for dogs\nWhen we experience stress, it can impact our mood, behavior, and relationships. The same goes for dogs.\n“None of us respond the best when we’re stressed,” Duxbury says. “We don’t bring our most rational selves to people or the environment…[Stress] sets the dog up not to do as well as they could.”\nWhen dogs experience stress — especially “trigger stacking,” or when multiple stressful or scary events “stack” on each other in a short period of time — it can cause them to act out, sometimes with uncharacteristic aggression, such as snapping or biting.\nThanks, they hate it.\nIt’s important to learn to recognize stress in your dog and know when it is necessary to take action to reduce that stress. Here are some things that might be stressing your dog out more than you expect:\nDogs have independent emotional lives, Duxbury says, and they form their own unique relationships with different people and pets. Just because someone is your best friend, doesn’t mean they’re your dog’s best friend, too.\nSometimes, the new person in your home is a baby or child. Even if your dog tolerates a newborn well, their stress levels might rocket when that toddler becomes mobile. Duxbury advises taking things slow and gradually acclimatizing your dog toa new baby, friend, or animal in the household.\nThe same rules apply when you’re out in public. Easter notes that people often insist on petting dogs they see — whether they know that dog or not. This can be especially stressful for more reserved dogs.\n“If your dog doesn’t want to be pet,” Easter says. “Ask (insist if needed) a person to ignore your dog and stand six feet away.”\nWhat might seem like a clear cue to us (“sit!”) might not be so obvious for our dogs.\n“People really underestimate how dogs read people,” Duxbury says. “Just minute changes in your posture… affect the quality of signal or cue you’re giving the dog.”\nIn other words, if the cue you’re giving (i.e., “Come!”) and body language (i.e., stern voice, aggressive posture) don’t match, it might confuse your dog. Duxbury, who advocates for reward-based training, says the same is true when you respond authoritatively when your dog does something wrong. Correction-based training doesn’t provide your dog with enough information on what they did wrong or how they should react instead, she says, which can also cause stress.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nWhile taking your dog for a walk is generallygood for their health, there are a few exceptions. For example, Easter says you should never force your dog to go on a walk if they appear stressed. If your dog pulls to go home, barks at other dogs, and/or displays other anxious behavior, listen to their needs and return home, she advises.\nWalking by barking dogs can also be extremely stressful. “No one wants to walk near someone screaming obscenities toward them, so why do we insist dogs should walk near dogs barking aggressively at them?” Easter says. “Change directions, and avoid that spot in the future.”\nWhile you might want to include your dog in all your fun weekend plans, our experts say it's best to consider what the experience really might be like for your dog. Duxbury says crowded locations such as farmers’ markets or breweries can be extremely stressful for all except the most social dogs. “They’re just looking at kneecaps and feet coming at them,” Duxbury adds. If you want to bring your dog to a brewery, try less crowded days and times, or sit on the periphery where it’s less busy.\nThe same goes for dog-oriented events and locations, such as dog parks. “There are huge expectations that your dog will be social with a bunch of other dogs they’ve never met,” Duxbury says. “Some dogs are. But some dogs aren’t, and they don’t bring their best selves to the dog park because it’s stressful.”\nFireworks and thunderstorms aren’t the only things that make them say,“No, thanks!”\nHow to recognize stress in your dog\nThe first step to supporting your dog is to learn how to recognize when your dog is starting to feel anxious or overwhelmed. The key here is to pay close attention to your dog’s body language. Here are a few signs to look out for that might indicate your dog is feeling stressed:\nExcessive yawning, panting, or lip licking\nExcessive yawning, panting, or lip licking\nWhale eye — when you see the whites of your dog’s eye\nWhale eye — when you see the whites of your dog’s eye\nLooking away\nLooking away\nPacing\nPacing\nCowering, trembling, or backing away from a situation\nCowering, trembling, or backing away from a situation\nPay attention to whether your dog’s stress is building. If it is, take action to mitigate your their anxiety so they don’t feel the need to act out. There are alsoseveral resourcesout therethat can help you identify body language in your dog that shows they are not OK.\nBoundaries, folks. Boundaries.\nCreate a stress-free zone\nThere is no one-size-fits-all solution to relieving anxiety for dogs. However, there are several things you can do to make your home feel like a safe space. Consider the following:\nFollowpositive reinforcement training: Both of our experts recommend seeking out a positive reinforcement behaviorconsultantortrainer. “Many [pet] guardians focus on symptoms (barking, hiding, hyperactivity) as a stressor when anxiety is usually the main cause,” Easter says. “Expert help is needed to clearly define the cause for anxiety and how to address the issue.”\nFollowpositive reinforcement training: Both of our experts recommend seeking out a positive reinforcement behaviorconsultantortrainer. “Many [pet] guardians focus on symptoms (barking, hiding, hyperactivity) as a stressor when anxiety is usually the main cause,” Easter says. “Expert help is needed to clearly define the cause for anxiety and how to address the issue.”\nGive your dog a safe space and comfy bed: If your dog doesn’t get along well with strangers, make sure they have a safe place in your bedroom to relax with food, water, and toys. If your dog isn’t allowed on your bed or furniture, Duxbury says to make sure your dog bed passes the “princess and the pea” test: If you pinch your dog bed and can feel your fingers rubbing together, then it’s too thin.\nGive your dog a safe space and comfy bed: If your dog doesn’t get along well with strangers, make sure they have a safe place in your bedroom to relax with food, water, and toys.

Help them, and listen to their needs.”\nDuxbury agrees, emphasizing that part of our duty as dog parents is to care for the emotional and mental well-being of our pets. “So much depends on trust and being able to count on your partner,” she says. “It’s really you and your dog against the world.”\nResources:\nFamily Paws Resources\nFamily Paws Resources\nHow to Tell If Your Dog Is Stressed\nHow to Tell If Your Dog Is Stressed\nStress in Dogs\nStress in Dogs",

  "page_content": "Ah, fall. You can feel it already, can’t you? There’s a faint chill in the breeze, pumpkin spice lattes are back on the streets, and so are the big yellow school buses. For us autumn lovers, it’s heaven, but for some dogs, this time of year can be a special kind of hell.\nIf your dog is anxious around children or crowds, back-to-school season can be a challenge. You love your walks together, but the sight of your poor, anxious pooch shaking as gaggles of kids walk by can be heartbreaking. Thankfully, there’s plenty you can do to bolster your dog’s confidence.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWe spoke with two certified trainers and a veterinary behaviorist to gather all the best techniques. Above all, our experts agree that it’s crucial to recognize and respect your dog as a sentient, autonomous being with feelings.\n“Each dog has their own likes and dislikes as well as comfort levels,” says Stephanie Barger, dog trainer and owner ofCanine Zen, which offers remote dog training throughout the United States. “They are not robots that just do whatever we say because we say it. You want to nurture your bond with your dog and help them to feel safe.”\nPro tips for boosting the confidence of a scaredy-cat dog.\nWhat body language do dogs use to tell us they’re scared or uncomfortable?\nWe’ve all heard that a dog holding their tail between their legs is unhappy, but canine body language is more complicated than that. Some dogs might wag their tails even when frightened. Watch how your dog carries his whole body instead.\nJulia Albright, a veterinary behaviorist at the University of Tennessee, notes that many dogs will begin to show their anxiety through subtle avoidance behaviors. “You’ll see things, likelip-licking, yawning, turning the head away,” she says. If you’re walking your dog on a leash near a group of children, their behavior might escalate because they can’t get away. “That tail is going to go down and be tucked,” Albright says. “The whites of their eyes are going to show. Quite often, their ears go back. That can be easier to tell on some dogs than the other.”\nRayanne Craven, a Mississippi-based trainer, notes that other signs of stress can include tight, closed lips; panting when it’s not warm outside; scanning the area and acting jumpy; crouching or walking low to the ground; and rejecting treats.\n“It’s important to watch your dog and notice what their body language is when they are relaxed at home so you can be able to noticewhen they are stressedin places or situations,” Craven says. Some signs are more obvious — like pulling on the leash to escape, whining, barking, growling, or snapping.\nAccording to Barger, dogs generally display more subtle signs of fear before they become aggressive or panic, but pet parents often overlook those early cues. Barger’s list of warning signs includes the eyes — hard versus soft stare, dilated pupils, exposed whites — as well as a stiff tail, sweaty paws, flexed toes, and stiff body movements.\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nHow can pet parents train puppies to socialize with children and not be afraid of big crowds?\nIf you’re raising a puppy, make sure they get enough safe exposure to children and crowds during their prime socialization period to feel comfortable in the future. All three of our experts agree that these outings should be enriching but not overwhelming. “With puppies,” Craven says, “you want to make sure that every socialization experience they have is a positive one.”\nAccording to theAmerican Veterinary Medical Association(AVMA), the prime socialization period for puppies runs from three to 14 weeks of age. Albright says this can last until 16 weeks. Gradually expose your puppy to the wider world in small, carefully moderated doses during this time.\nYour puppy won’t be fully vaccinated until 20 weeks, so you’ll need to minimize any exposure to pathogens. “For example,” Barger suggests, “take your puppy out for a ‘walk’ while carrying them so that they can experience kids gathering at the bus stop while they are not fully vaccinated.” Along the way, your puppy will also get used to things like cars, bikes, skateboards, and buses.\nCraven urges pet parents to start small with these adventures — like walking for five to 10 minutes at a distance from a big crowd or playground full of children. “Bring super tasty treats and even a chew toy and sit with your puppy rewarding them for just watching at a distance while they take treats from you or work on their chew toy,” she says.\nThis is where knowing your dog’s body language becomes vital. “If they want to move away, let them,” Craven says. “Over several sessions, you can move closer to the playground or large crowd, or if they are comfortable, even let them greet a child or two, but continue to keep the sessions short.”\nAlbright warns pet parents not to “flood” their dogs — meaning, put them in stressful situations for the sake of getting them used to it. Just because a dog is good with a familiar child or two at home, “don’t assume they’re going to be OK with five unfamiliar children running up to them at a bus stop.”\nYou love that your dog is your shadow, but maybe not when you’re on a Zoom call.\nWhat do you do if your dog is already afraid of children?\nAdjust your walking route and schedule to avoid children as much as possible. This will reduce your dog’s stress, and therefore their anxiety. From there, you can begin working with a professional to boost their confidence.\n“When looking for help with behavior modification, you want to find someone using positive reinforcement techniques and who go at the dog’s pace,” Barger says. “Behavior modification takes time and is not a linear process, so working with someone who not only knows this but can support you when things don't move as quickly as you would like is important to your long-term success.”\nIf your dog becomes comfortable enough to interact with children, coach the kids first on how best to approach. We should all seek consent before petting a dog, Albright says, ideally by standing five or 10 feet away and calling them over. Make sure kids know how to offer their affection as well. You don’t want to hover your hand above a dog’s head; instead, offer an open palm in front of them below chin level.\nIf your dog’s fear of children seems sudden, ask your veterinarian for a full workup and exam to rule out any potential medical concerns.\n“I have heard of cases where the dog had a fear of children, either suddenly, or the fear had worsened, and come to find out there was a medical condition that was causing the dog pain and stress,” Craven says. Once any medical issues have been cleared, your dog might be more receptive to training.\nAnd what to do when they go careening away from the Roomba.\nHow do you help adult dogs become better at dealing with large crowds?\nWe want our dogs to live full, happy lives, but this also means respecting their boundaries. Some dogs might never feel comfortable in these situations, and in those cases, our experts suggest that it’s likely better to let them stay at home where they feel safe.\nAlbright puts it simply: “When people say, ‘Can you train your dog to deal with crowds of people?’ the real answer is ‘Maybe, but should you?’”\nIf you and a professional determine that training would be beneficial, proceed slowly. Systematic desensitization uses positive reinforcement to help your dog progressively become more comfortable around triggers. This might mean learning to walk slightly closer to crowds or tolerate louder, more rambunctious children (or a greater number of children) nearby. Work with a professional to evaluate your dog’s body language and use reward-based training to establish positive associations with the things that make them uncomfortable.\nMaybe you start by training in the same area as (but at a safe distance from) a calm child who is occupied with something else. Over time, Barger says, “you would then increase the activity level, the number of children involved or decrease the distance as your dog becomes more comfortable.”\nYou’ll want to keep these training sessions short and sweet, especially at first. Barger usually limits high-stress exercises to 15 to 20 minutes per day and often shorter. “You want to give your dog time to decompress before exposing them to the scary thing again,” she says. “So, some dogs need a day or two off between training sessions.”\nDuring these training sessions, let your dog’s emotions set the pace. It’s up to us to show our dogs that we know how to keep them safe, and forcing them into situations where they feel unsafe might lead to aggression later on. Although it might be embarrassing to stand next to your dog while they bark endlessly on a leash, avoid the temptation to shut down their emotional responses. That, too, is important information.\nDid you get a dog for emotional support and now they are the one who needs it?\nHow do you train fearful dogs to peacefully walk away from a crowd or avoid children during walks?\nBefore you work on training, make sure you’ve done everything you can to make walks peaceful. If your usual route goes past a school or bus stop, walk in a different direction and avoid pick-up and drop-off hours. If you see a cluster of kids approaching, cross the street or make a turn to distance yourself.\nThe more you limit your dog’s exposure to triggers, the easier your daily strolls will become. Still, occasional encounters are inevitable. In those moments, redirect your dog to something positive.\n“It is usually possible to change your dog’s behavior if they are given enough distance from the thing that scares them and an alternative behavior to do that is rewarding to them,” Barger says. One technique is called nose-targeting — which means training your dog to “touch” a target (for example, an outstretched hand) with the tip of their nose.\nCraven suggests trying outControl Unleashed Pattern Gamesfrom certified dog behavior consultant and author Leslie McDevitt. These games help distract dogs from perceived threats by giving them something more fun to do. Craven particularly likes theOne-Two-Three Pattern Game, in which you teach the dog that whenever you say “three” they get a treat. Little treats are crucial in life, and in this case, they can be the difference between a pleasant walk and utter chaos.\nIf you worry that your dog might bite someone, you might want to train them to become comfortable wearing a well-fitted muzzle. This will not only help prevent bites, Craven says, but also communicate to others (especially children) that your dog probably doesn’t want to be touched. Check outThe Muzzle Up! Project forhelp with muzzle fittingand training.\nStep one: Never put your face close to theirs.\nWhat should you do if your dog bites a child?\nNone of us want to imagine that our dog could bite someone, let alone a child. Avoiding triggers and maintaining a safe distance should help to prevent any bad encounters. Still, accidents happen, and it’s important to take responsibility. If you don’t already know your local laws regarding dog bites, look them up to ensure that if a situation arises, you’ll be prepared. Also, make sure your dog is always up to date on vaccinations and required care.\nIf your dog bites someone, don’t get angry, Albright says. The damage is already done, and anger will only make the situation worse. Instead, focus on removing your dog from the situation as quickly as possible. Avoid removing your dog if they still have an active grip on the person they’ve injured, Barger warns. Pulling them away then could cause greater damage. Instead, wait for a moment, once their jaw has released.\nOnce you’ve established distance from the injured person, Craven suggests scattering treats on the ground at a safe distance from the child to calm and distract your dog. If that doesn’t work, try moving to a place where your dog cannot see the child. “Sometimes, going behind a car, garbage bin, or even into an alleyway can help break the visual contact for your dog and allow them to start calming down,” Craven says.\nIf another adult is not present, wait with the child (at a safe distance) until a caregiver arrives. If you’re alone, you might need to tether your dog away from the scared, injured person. Once an adult arrives, provide them your contact information in case they need to reach you later on.\n“Don’t try to hide things,” Albright says. “Be open. Work with that family. Offer to pay the bills. But nothing good ever comes from trying to shirk responsibility.”\nAbove all, remember that every family has a different approach to teaching their children about how to interact with dogs, and somemay not have done so at all. Not every child will understand the appropriate way to behave, so it’syourresponsibility to set the necessary boundaries and work with your dog to keep everyone safe.\nReferences:\nSocialization of Dogs and Cats\nSocialization of Dogs and Cats\nControl Unleashed Pattern Games\nControl Unleashed Pattern Games",

  "page_content": "The time you can safely leave a dog alone depends on several factors, including age, health, and personality. As a general guideline, adult dogs can be left alone for six to eight hours, while puppies and senior dogs may require more frequent attention and breaks.\nResearch shows that little dogs may feel the need to scent mark more frequently than big dogs.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHow long can a dog stay home alone?\nAlthough dog parents want to spend as much time as possible with their favorite pup, life often gets in the way. Dogs don’t understand that their parents have to earn money to pay rent and buy important things like dog food, dog treats, dog toys, dog beds, and dog clothes.\nDespite not fully grasping the economic and social factors resulting in time apart, most dogs are OK with being left alone for part of the day. But how long is too long for a dog to be home alone?\nThe amount of time a dog can be left alone will vary depending on their age, personality, behavior, and overall health. In general, a healthy adult dog can probably be left alone for six to eight hours.It’ll take some work and effort to establish a routine and make sure they’re comfortable with that amount of time though. Don’t expect the adult dog you’ve just adopted to immediately be OK with being left for an extended period in a place that’s entirely foreign to them.\nGetting a puppy is a big commitment, and their need for attention, feeding, and walks isa major factorin the amount of work required to care for them. A general rule of thumb that has been proposed is to not leave a puppy alone for more hours than their age in months (up to six months). There is no scientific evidence to back this up, but this timing seems to work for many puppies and their parents.\nIt’s important to realize that every puppy is different and that some may not tolerate extended time without attention. Newborn puppies who are still under mom’s supervision can be entrusted to her care for a little longer, but bottle babies need regular feeding, stimulating, and checking to make sure they’re doing OK.\nMany senior dogs who are used to spending time alone at home will be OK with resting for six to eight hours during the day. As dogs age,chronic conditionsand changes to normal body functions become more common. These factors could affect your senior dog’s ability to remain comfortable at home for as long as they used to.\nLaws about leaving dogs home alone vary from community to community. Some areas have no protections for dogs at home alone, while others havestrict guidelines. Some common guidelines to make sure dogs aren’t suffering include:\nGeneral considerations for safety: Dogs should be kept in an area where they can rest comfortably and not be injured inadvertently.\nGeneral considerations for safety: Dogs should be kept in an area where they can rest comfortably and not be injured inadvertently.\nAdequate resources: Dogs must have access to water, enough space to eliminate, and regular feedings\nAdequate resources: Dogs must have access to water, enough space to eliminate, and regular feedings\nAccess to cover: In some areas, it’s illegal to leave dogs outside unsupervised for prolonged periods, especially if they are chained in an open area or in a yard without available protection from the elements.\nAccess to cover: In some areas, it’s illegal to leave dogs outside unsupervised for prolonged periods, especially if they are chained in an open area or in a yard without available protection from the elements.\nPet parents may wonder: “is it cruel to leave a dog alone all day?” This will depend on the dog. Many dogs seem fine with spending time alone and are perfectly happy to curl up for a long rest while their parents are out of the house. Other dogs with separation anxiety or other medical issues cannot be left alone all day without experiencing significant discomfort.\nRemote video monitoring can help to make sure your dog is resting and not distressed while you’re gone. Your veterinarian or a veterinary behaviorist can help evaluate your dog’s behaviors to make sure they’re not showing subtle signs of stress when left alone. Although many dogs are OK with spending a workday by themselves, most would likely appreciate some interaction during the day. If possible, this can be provided by a dog walker, a friend or relative stopping by to check on them, or by you on your lunch break.\nPro tips for boosting the confidence of a scaredy-cat dog.\nFactors affecting a dog’s ability to stay alone\nEvery dog’s tolerance for time alone will be different. A number of behavioral, medical, and environmental factors contribute to their comfort with being left at home.\nOne of the big limiting factors in how much time a dog can spend alone comfortably is their physical needs. Dogs need to pee and poop, and many like to do it on a schedule. This schedule may fit well around your needs, or it may not, but your dog is going to go to the bathroom one way or another. Some common health conditions that can affect how frequently a dog needs to go out include:\nDiabetes mellitus\nDiabetes mellitus\nInflammatory bowel disease\nInflammatory bowel disease\nKidney disease\nKidney disease\nCushing’s disease\nCushing’s disease\nDiabetes insipidus\nDiabetes insipidus\nBladder stones\nBladder stones\nUrinary tract infections\nUrinary tract infections\nUrinary incontinence\nUrinary incontinence\nSpinal issues\nSpinal issues\nMedications can also make some dogs need to drink and pee a lot more. Diuretics like furosemide (Lasix) or steroids like prednisone will require frequent toilet breaks. Some smaller dogs may be trained to use potty pads indoors, but this tends to not be a great solution for big dogs.\nPuppy parents may feel like their growing dogs spend most of their awake time eating, peeing, or pooping. Puppies need very frequent bathroom breaks to prevent accidents and help with house training. Staying on top of their needs can be a pain in the short term, but reinforcing desired elimination behaviors early should pay off for years to come.\nOlder dogs’ needs change as they age. Senior dogs are more likely to have declining kidney function, sore joints, incontinence, and issues with vision. These conditions mean that they’ll need to pee more frequently, to move around and stretch their legs more regularly, and to be helped navigating their surroundings when light is fading.\nDogs are most comfortable with a set routine. Knowing what to expect helps to reduce anxiety and makes it easier for dogs to stay alone longer. While some routine variations are inevitable, you can help set expectations for your dog by sticking to the same procedure whenever you leave the house or return. You can try having them lie down calmly in the area they should stay in, giving them a treat, then leaving right after.\nEven dogs who are used to being left home during working hours can be upset and act out due to a change in their environment.Moving to a new homeis a big upheaval for you and your dog. It’s not surprising that they may be anxious being in an unfamiliar space without you. Try to give your dog time to get used to their new home before leaving them there alone there. When you do start leaving them alone, try to keep initial times short, then increase as they become comfortable with the idea of staying in their new home.\nOther environmental changes, construction in the area, visitors, new pets, or bad weather can also upset your dog’s usual routine. Try to be aware of factors that could make your dog uncomfortable with spending time alone and adjust your schedule to help relieve any anxiety.\nDogs may be more comfortable spending time without their parents in a multi-pet household. Other dogs can provide companionship, entertainment, and guidance while their people are out of the house. Established companions can be great buddies, but you should be cautious when leaving new housemates alone together. Behavioral issues may come up unexpectedly if you’re not there to watch things.\nYou know your dog better than anyone, so you likely have the best idea about how your dog tolerates being alone. Some dogs are so clingy that they’re upset the moment they’re not being held, while others seem to care less if their parents are around as long as the food shows up on time. While most dogs would prefer to be around their parents, some can have an abnormal attachment to them and display undesired behavior when left alone.\nYou shouldn’t make them cross their legs for long!\nSeparation anxiety in dogs\nSeparation anxietycan show up in many ways, but at its root, it’s any unwanted or destructive behavior that manifests due to anxiety that occurs only when a dog is away from their parent. This behavioral disorder can be extremely distressing for both the dog and their parent. It’s best to consult with your vet or a veterinary behaviorist as soon as possible if you suspect your dog is showing signs of separation anxiety. Undesirable behaviors can worsen without appropriate treatment.\nSome of the most common symptoms of separation anxiety include:\nVocalization\nVocalization\nDestructive behavior\nDestructive behavior\nHouse soiling\nHouse soiling\nLip licking\nLip licking\nYawning\nYawning\nDrooling\nDrooling\nAggression during departure\nAggression during departure\nEscaping\nEscaping\nDogs with separation anxietymay give you some clues to the problem, but it’s often hard to know what they’re up to while you’re away. Video monitoring of their behavior while you’re gone can help to identify this condition.\n“Curing” separation anxiety can be difficult. For a moderately to severely affected dog, separation anxiety medication may be recommended to help speed and aid control of symptoms. This medication, combined with behavioral andenvironmental modificationcan help your dog learn that it’s OK for you to be away and that youwillreturn to be with them again.\nIf your dog has separation anxiety, working with your vet or a veterinary behaviorist is the best way to develop specific strategies for your dog’s anxiety triggers. Some common methods forreducing anxious behaviorsinclude:\nHaving a consistent departure routine\nHaving a consistent departure routine\nIgnoring attention-seeking behavior until your dog is calm\nIgnoring attention-seeking behavior until your dog is calm\nNot making a big deal over your dog as soon as you arrive home\nNot making a big deal over your dog as soon as you arrive home\nRelaxation exercises or cues\nRelaxation exercises or cues\nConsistent exercise\nConsistent exercise\nGradually increasing separation times\nGradually increasing separation times\nThe effects of separation anxiety can severely strain a parent’s relationship with their dog, so it’s important to recognize the symptoms and work with your vet to control them so that both you and your dog are as comfortable and stress free as possible.\nThe next time your dog pees on your favorite rug, be prepared with this simple, three-step method.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nDogs aresocial animals, and they benefit greatly from companionship. While dogs can tolerate being alone for a little while, it’s best to keep those times limited so they feel included as part of your life.\nSeparation anxietyis a complex behavioral issue. Dogs with separation anxiety often benefit from a combination of medication and training to find a routine that helps to reduce their stress about being separated from their favorite person.\nReferences:\nVideo Analysis of Adult Dogs When Left Home Alone\nVideo Analysis of Adult Dogs When Left Home Alone\nVideo Analysis of Dogs Suffering From Anxiety When Left Home Alone and Treated With Clomipramine\nVideo Analysis of Dogs Suffering From Anxiety When Left Home Alone and Treated With Clomipramine\nPuppy Behavior When Left Home Alone: Changes During the First Few Months After Adoption\nPuppy Behavior When Left Home Alone: Changes During the First Few Months After Adoption\nPuppy Behaviours When Left Home Alone: A Pilot Study\nPuppy Behaviours When Left Home Alone: A Pilot Study\nThe Effect of Time Left Alone at Home on Dog Welfare\nThe Effect of Time Left Alone at Home on Dog Welfare\nBarking in Home Alone suburban dogs (\nBarking in Home Alone suburban dogs (\nPet Dogs Home Alone: A Video-Based Study\nPet Dogs Home Alone: A Video-Based Study\nHome Safe Home: Treating Canine Separation Anxiety\nHome Safe Home: Treating Canine Separation Anxiety\nImpact of Changes in Time Left Alone on Separation-Related Behaviour in UK Pet Dogs\nImpact of Changes in Time Left Alone on Separation-Related Behaviour in UK Pet Dogs",

  "page_content": "Pet parents of reactive dogs — dogs who show an excessive or intense response to stimuli — know how tricky it can be to go on public excursions with their pets. Reactive pups need personal space, and it’s not always easy to convey that to well-intentioned strangers who want to give out chin scratches. But the Yellow Bandana Project, a new initiative by the city of Vancouver, BC, promises to help.\n“If you’ve ever walked a reactive dog, you know how hard it is to calm them down once they have been triggered,” says thecity of Vancouver’s website.So, they’re giving their residents a way to communicate their pups’ needs ahead of time. The Yellow Bandana Project helps others identify reactive dogs; when they see a pup sporting a yellow bandana, they know to keep their distance and avoid overwhelming the dog.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n“There’s a difference between a reactive dog and an aggressive dog. I would say that’s an important distinction to make,” Kim Rosenmayer, an employee of the City of Vancouver Animal Services,explained on Global News BC.To illustrate her point, she was joined by an extremely chilled-out, sleepy Chihuahua named Lloyd, who sported a yellow bandana himself. Though Lloyd is peaceful while lying next to her on the couch, Rosenmayer explained that other young dogs and children can make him nervous. “A reactive dog will react to common stimuli that might not bother other dogs,” she said.\nTurns out, even experts have a hard time defining these terms.\nThose reactions might include undesirable behaviors like yanking on their leashes, barking, or running to hide. Sometimes dogs are easily overexcited, and sometimes they’re anxious. “Some dogs just need a little extra space,” Rosenmayer said.\nVancouver isn’t the first to try this solution. They took inspiration fromYellow Dog UK,an organization that provides resources for the pet parents of reactive dogs. On its website, Yellow Dog UK asks that people avoid approaching dogs who are wearing a yellow ribbon or bandana.\nPet parents who have their dogs licensed with the city of Vancouver can email animal.services@vancouver.ca, call 311, or stop by Animal Services to get a free yellow bandana. Rosenmayer adds that, wherever you live, any yellow bandana or ribbon can be used to spread the word about the Yellow Dog Project and help signal your own pup’s boundaries.\nThe farther the initiative spreads, the better. As it gains in popularity, it becomes a more effective signal. “When I go walking in my local park with Lloyd, I’ve been using it,” Rosenmayer said. “People are starting to recognize the signal, and they’ll leash [their off-leash dogs] up. It’s a much more pleasant kind of interaction with other dog owners.”",

  "page_content": "AirTags are great for keeping track of your keys or checked bags when you travel, but they are not designed for pets. Kaiann Drance, vice president of worldwide iPhone marketing at Apple, said toFast Companyin April of 2021, immediately after the product was announced. Yet no sooner were AirTags introduced to the world than a secondary market popped up, adapting them for this exact purpose.\nOf course, products are adapted for new and unintended purposes all the time. Bubble wrap, for instance, was originallyinvented as  3D wallpaper, while Kotexstarted out as wound dressingduring Wold War I.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nBut just because a productcanbe used a certain way, doesn’t mean itshould. Youcanuse a Q-tip to clean out your ears, but you’re not supposed to. In fact, there is a warning right there on the box that says inserting a Q-tip into the ear canal can cause injury.\nBuddha Dog Rescue and Recovery founder Nicole Asher’s pro tips for getting your missing pup home safe.\nThere are pros and cons to using AirTags.\nSo, when it comes to your pets, are AirTags more Kotex or Q-tip? Let’s look at some of the pros and cons.\nThis means they can be attached to your pet’s collar via a third party adapter without weighing them down or getting in their way.\nIf swallowed, surgery could be required to retrieve them.\nTo reduce the risk of the AirTag detaching from your pet’s collar, use acollar with a built-in AirTag portor aseparate AirTag holderthat lies flush against your dog’s existing collar. You don’t want the AirTag hanging off the collar, since another dog could latch onto it during play and swallow it.\nAirTags work by pinging off nearby Apple products running the Find My app. As as long as your pet is near such a device, you should be able to find them, whether they are miles from home or just chilling in the dark recesses of the spare bedroom closet.\nAirTags use bluetooth to reach out to nearby devices, so if there aren’t any devices in range, you won’t be able to find them. This means they are better suited to more densely populated areas, like big cities, as opposed to more rural locales where the devices are fewer and farther between.\nGPS collar alternatives,like Whistle, do exist. They come with a subscription but may be a better option if you want to be able to track your pup at all times.\nAstudy publishedby the National Library of Medicine in 2021 found that pet exposure from these devices was well within healthy limits.\nBecause AirTags emit constantly and cannot be turned off, study author Judith Klune and her team recommend only putting the trackers on your pets when there is an imminent need, like when they are going outside or when you are going out of town.\nFollow these expert tips so your bestie can come home ASAP.\nReal pet parents weigh in: should you use AirTags on your pets?\nSo,shouldyou use AirTags to track your pets? It’s really up to you. There are risks, but there are also ways to mitigate those risks, as outlined above. We talked to some real pet parents who’ve tried this route to keep an eye on their pets.\n“My wife and I got AirTags for our cats when we adopted them,” cat dad Jeff Warner says. “But we rarely use them anymore. Mostly just if we are traveling or have a lot of people coming in and out of the house. The last time we used them was when we took the cats to visit my mom. They are so good at hiding and the AirTags just let us know that they were still in the house.”\nAlexis DiGregorio started using AirTags on her cats after moving cross country and trading an apartment for a house. “I knew the cats would be curious about the outside and I wanted a way to track them if they got out,” she says. So far, only one has actually made it past the front door, and she was quickly spotted and called back inside.\nA dog dad named Frank, who asked that we not use his real name in this article, used to use an AirTag on his dog, Bill, especially when letting him off leash or leaving him with a sitter. But he switched to a GPS collar about a year ago for safety reasons.\n“A neighbor of mine left her dog with a sitter, and the dog ran away,” he says. “We think she was stolen after that because we found the AirTag, but not the dog. I feel like people know what AirTags look like, so they know to get rid of them. The GPS collar is maybe harder to recognize if you don’t know what you’re looking for.”\nWhether you decide to use AirTags or not,microchipping is essential. It is your first, most reliable, best line of defense if your dog or cat goes missing and finds its way into a shelter or vet. Just make sure your chip is in good working order (your vet can scan it on your next visit) and that your information is up to date with the microchip company. And if you want to use an AirTag, too, that’s your decision. Honestly, just do what you can to mitigate the risks, and you’ll probably be fine either way.\nReferences:\nTracking Devices for Pets: Health Risk Assessment for Exposure to Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields †",

  },
  "page_content": "My recurring nightmare involves needing to distract, entertain, or train my dog in a challenging situation and not being able to find a single Kong anywhere. I look in the toy box, in the freezer, in my house-call bag, and in the dog supplies storage closet. Becoming alarmed, I check all the dog beds, under the couch, and in my car, but still no luck. Fully freaking out by this point, I throw my head between my knees and assume the crash position while I try to remember where I might have stashed an emergency Kong.\nThe nightmare is both absurdly melodramatic and true to my reality. Ilove Kongs. I use them in many ways for training dogs, for managing challenging situations, to make dogs’ lives better, and to prevent trouble. Imagining life without them actually is scary (plus, they come in sizes for every kind of dog —even puppies).\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThere was a time before Kongs, but thankfully it was a long time ago. The inventor of the Kong,Joe Markham, owned an auto shop, and he got a dog named Fritz to help guard it against thieves. Fritz was a good guard dog, but he was also a destructive chewer, obsessed with rocks, sticks, and even radiator hoses. It wasn’t until Fritz got hold of a rubber VW axle stop that he finally had something to chew on that interested him but didn’t destroy and didn’t hurt his teeth. That car part inspired Joe to invent the Kong — which bounces in an unpredictable fun way and can be filled with food to further entice dogs into focusing their attention on it instead of on furniture, kids’ toys, wooden kitchen utensils or anything else most of us want our dogs to leave alone.\nI am in favor of everyone having multiple Kongs to use and stuff in a variety of ways and in a variety of contexts. I will talk to any stranger anywhere, at any moment, and for any length of time with details about stuffing a Kong to make them more enticing, more interesting, last longer, and be more effective. Using a stuffed Kong can make life better, and I have my share of favorite hacks to make using Kongs easier and require less effort.\nTwo words: Endless entertainment.\nKong-stuffing 101\nOne of the easiest ways to put food in a Kong is to smear peanut butter around the inside of it. A couple of spoonfuls of this treat, so loved by almost all dogs, can keep them occupied and happy, and it’s not that hard to do. Canned dog food, cream cheese, and puréed pumpkin are also popular fillings. Most dogs immediately have an interest in a Kong stuffed with these tasty options as long as some is near the opening, so they have some success right away. To offer other good early experiences with a Kong, stuff it with a mix of kibble and treats so they easily come out with just the slightest manipulation by the dog. It’s important that they get the hang of getting food from the Kong without frustration early on.\nFor a more complex Kong-stuffing experience, think layers. I like to begin with a few really tasty treats or pieces of real meat. Then, I add layers of canned dog food or pureed pumpkin, kibble, treats or meat, and repeat. For dogs who are not yet experts with a Kong, I start with loosely packing the stuffing so they have plenty of success early on and associate the Kong with positive experiences.\nAs they get more experience, I pack it tighter so they have to work a little harder to extract the food. That makes it last longer, which is good for everybody. I still like to keep the top layer loose and easy to access so dogs get something from the Kong right away and are not tempted to give up on it, which some dogs will do if it’s too hard to get anything rewarding from it.\nAdvanced Kong-stuffing can make it last longer and be more interesting to your dog. If extracting the food poses a greater challenge, the dog gets more mental exercise, the opportunity to face something hard and succeed, and to spend more time in an engaging activity. However, a Kong should never be so hard to access that the dog becomes overly frustrated or decides that Kongs are worthless because they can’t get anything out of one. Once dogs are experienced with Kongs and have had many opportunities to succeed at getting food out of them, these harder, more challenging advanced Kong stuffing strategies can make life better for them and for you.\nOne of the best ways to make a Kong more challenging and last longer is to freeze it. Frozen food is more difficult to take out of the Kong and it takes dogs longer to do so. Frozen Kongs require something in them to hold everything together, and canned dog food does the job beautifully.\nOther options, such as stew or pumpkin, are also effective. When a dog is not yet accustomed to a frozen Kong, it’s essential to make sure they enjoy it and don’t give up because they are not getting anything. Before giving one to your dog, add a little unfrozen stuff to top it off so the dog does not get frustrated when you are first getting them used to frozen Kongs. So, fill the Kong up about an inch from the top prior to freezing, but put in some peanut butter, unfrozen wet food, or some treats before giving it to the dog.\nAn even more challenging option with a frozen Kong is to change the shape of the opening from a circle to an oval by filling the Kong, squeezing it to change the opening shape to a long thin one, and then putting a biscuit or other hard treat in the opening to make sure it holds that shape. Your dog will first have to remove the item and will then be dealing with a Kong of a different form than they are used to. Again, only advance to this level of difficulty with a dog who is used to the challenge of Kongs and will not give up entirely.\nThere are other ways to up your Kong-stuffing game. You can put a stuffed Kong inside something such as a dish towel, an old cereal box, or an oatmeal container, so your dog has to unwrap the Kong prior to accessing it. Only use items you know your dog won’t try to eat, and please supervise your dog for safety when trying something new. Be prepared to trade with them by giving them treats in exchange for the container holding the Kong if they start to eat it. Then you can unwrap it and present the plain, stuffed Kong to them.\nDon’t hit pause on your pet’s playtime – these solo activities will help 9-5 fly by for them.\nHow to use a Kong to make life better\nNewsflash: Not all dogs are at their very bestwhen visitors arrive. Whether that is true of your dog because of their boundless enthusiasm and friendliness, their fearfulness, their loud barking, or because they go into stranger danger mode and become aggressive, Kongs can help. Offering your dog a stuffed Kong filled with goodies gives them something else to pay attention to rather than the visitors, and it keeps their mouth busy. Dogs with a Kong are happier, they are not bored, and they have a purpose.\nDepending on the dog, you can give them the Kong in the main part of the house, in the yard, or in another room with the door closed. For an aggressive dog, keeping them away from guests but happy may involve receiving a Kong in a place away from the action. For friendly but exuberant dogs, being near the visitors with a Kong can often lead to being calm and able to greet visitors politely once they have finished with the Kong. The Kong gives them something to do while they get used to any visitors so they can put their best paw forward once they interact.\nKongs can keep dogs distracted and make them happy. That makes them ideal solutions to minor fears of thunderstorms, to the horror (to many dogs) that we call Halloween, to keep dogs from becoming upset when you leave (though not for true separation anxiety), dealing with dogs who bark at passersby or the mail carrier or delivery people, to keep dogs from chasing bicycles and skateboarders, and a variety of the daily challenges of life. For dogs who struggle to deal with grooming such as nail trims or being brushed, a stuffed Kong can certainly help.\nNormally, most of us keep our dogs busy and enrich their lives doing the things we enjoy together, such as walks, petting, and play sessions. A typical day might involve a hike or a run, some training, and plenty of time cuddling. Bad days can be different. Whether you have a particularly busy workday, the bad weather is ruining your plans, you are ill, or you are out for the evening, Kongs can help everybody. Your dog gets to enjoy a food puzzle and all the treats and yummy flavors inside, and you can go about your day withjust a little less guilt.\nUsing Kongs in this way — giving your dog something to do even though you can’t spend much time with them — is fine every once in a while when you are really stuck, but remember it’s still important to spend quality time with your dog, and the Kong is not a replacement for you.\nTrain your dog to stay calm when they’re on their own — instead of sad-singing“All By Myself”until you come home.\nTaking the hassle out of using Kongs\nKongs are a way of life for me, but I do understand that incorporating them into your dog’s training or daily schedule requires effort. I’ve had clients who have argued within their family about who should stuff them, who should clean them, who lost them, and who forgot to buy another one.\nI want Kongs to add to your quality of life and that of your dog — not add stress, angst, or conflict to it. Here are my favorite hacks to make using Kongs easier and more effortless, and to minimize the hassles of having one at the ready when you need one to give to your dog.\nIf you suddenly need a Kong and have to prepare it, that can feel stressful. If all you have to do is open the freezer to grab one, and maybe add a dollop of peanut butter or some wet food to top it off, that’s a way better situation, especially if time is of the essence to help your dog be at their best. Having six, eight, or more ready to go is a great idea.\nTo have Kongs available all the time, I like to stuff a whole bunch at once prior to storing them in the freezer. I have different sizes and shapes in there so I can give a dog a big treat, a little treat, a classic Kong, aGoodie Ribbon, ora Tire. Dogs often enjoy variety, so receiving Kongs of different styles adds to the enrichment they offer for your dog. I line up a dozen Kongs at a time and stuff them with a variety of ingredients before freezing them in bags or in other containers to keep them fresh until they are used.\nTo make Kong-stuffing easier, I keep a lot of ingredients in the house that can be put inside a Kong. When I am stuffing a bunch of Kongs, it’s not unusual for me to use six or seven different kinds of treats, two brands of kibble, two types of wet food, and some human food (cream cheese, chicken, steak, peanut butter) to include as well.\nThen, as I am stuffing a bunch of Kongs at once, I can make them all different, or I can do them all the same if that suits my mood. I even keep tubes ofKong Stuff’n Easy Treatin the house for those time I need to stuff a Kongright now,and it feels like too much of a bother. These spray cans of food goo are a lifesaver when you are hanging on by a thread in the sanity department and lack the energy for doing much of anything. The liver flavor is the most popular in my house, but the peanut butter one is best loved all around.\nI love Kongs (I know, my secret is out!), but stuffing them can be messy and even irksome. To avoid those problems, I put each classic Kong in a mug with the large opening facing up and stuff them in that position. This keeps them all from rolling around or spilling. Having each Kong secured in the proper position to accommodate being stuffed is a game changer.\nThere is no reason for washing Kongs to be a burden. They can go in the dishwasher (top shelf only!) which was such happy news to me when a fellow dog trainer imparted this wisdom to me. Hand-washing is good many times, but the dishwasher is great when you are really short on time. Another bit of advice is to buy aKong-cleaning brushthat makes it easier to get in and scrub the inside. It does an even better job of removing residue from the inside of a Kong than a dog’s tongue, and at less than $10, it’s a good deal.\nTo wrap this up, I wish I could write a love poem about Kongs. They improve life for both pups and their humans insomany ways. As I am not a poet, I stick firmly to composing prose when sharing why I love Kongs so much.",

  "page_content": "For the first month after he was adopted, Sunny spent his time in the corner of one room — where he ate, slept, peed, and generally watched the world go by. Murphy whimpered, barked, and chewed the carpet whenever she was left alone. Tucker growled and lunged at every man he encountered. Maggie was inconsolable during thunderstorms —  pacing, whining, circling, jumping in and out of the bathtub.\nAll of these dogs have one thing in common: Their behavioral problems are a result of fear. But because fear-based behavior can vary so widely — from cowering under the table when a truck roars by to lunging at and evenbiting visitors— pet parents don’t always recognize that their dogs exhibiting it are fearful.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nPer Nicole Wilde, canine behavior specialist and author ofHelp for Your Fearful Dog“There are lots of fearful dogs, but people call because of the symptoms. They rarely say, ‘I need help because my dog is fearful.’ They call because their dog is barking at visitors or shredding things.”\nHow can I tell if my dog is fearful?\nThese fear-based behaviors don’t improve until the underlying issues have been dealt with. Further, as the fear worsens, so does the problem behavior. Dr. Dan Estep, PhD and certified applied animal behaviorist (CAAB), notes that, unfortunately, early and perhaps subtle signs of fear —ears pulled back, tail tucked, avoidance — are often written off as things that all dogs do. If these signs are ignored, the signals may become more obvious and include panting and dilated pupils.\nEven then, it may be possible to distract the dog from the fear source. But, over time, fearful dogs act more intensely, become harder to distract, and then becomedestructive or reactive. Only then, when the problem is much more serious and harder to resolve, do people seek help. That’s why it’s so important to recognize the signs of fearfulness in dogs and intervenebeforethe behavior becomes more difficult to deal with.\nAccording to Dr. Estep, “fears have behavioral, physiological, and subjective components.” Some dogs flee in an attempt to avoid the stimuli that elicit fear; these dogs may hide under the bed or behind their guardian, or simply turn away from whatever it is that frightens them. The appearance of some dogs’ eyes change when they are afraid: The pupils may dilate, or more of the sclera (whites of the eyes) may be visible in an expression known as “whale eye.” This may be the result of a dog watching what frightens them by moving their eyes so they can see it without looking at it directly. Or, a dog may scan an area repeatedly in a highly vigilant manner.\nFearful dogs may also adopt telltale body postures: crouching in a lowered body position or lying down and freezing. Many dogs whine,barkor make other distress vocalizations. A fearful dog who is forced to confront or contend with what’s scaring them may become defensively aggressive while still exhibiting signs of fear.\nHow to cope with dog anxiety—from training to medication.\nDogs who are fearful often exhibit many physiological changes, as well: the sympathetic nervous system becomes aroused, which means an increase in heart rate and respiration and possibly shaking, trembling, or panting. As Dr. Estep observes, “No one of these signs by themselves is a reliable indicator of fear or any other emotional state. It’s the pattern of these things together that indicates fear.”\nBoth Dr. Estep and Wilde note that most common canine fears are related to loud or sudden noises,separation anxiety, and unfamiliar people. A fearful dog can be afraid of just about anything new, whether it’s a man in a hat, an umbrella, or a stroller.\nJust as the behavior exhibited by fearful dogs can vary, so can the reasons for the fearfulness. This may be because fear is such a common emotion. As Dr. Patricia B. McConnell, PhD, writes inFor the Love of a Dog: Understanding Emotion in You and Your Best Friend, “Surely fear must be the universal of emotions, given its importance to survival. Without it, even civilized urban dwellers wouldn’t live to pass on their genes, because they’d stroll in front of buses and forget to lock their doors at night.”\nMcConnell’s example is apt: Fear serves an important function. Without fear, it would be difficult to recognize dangers to which the appropriate reaction is critical for survival. So, fear is not itself a bad thing. It becomes a problem when individuals of any species, including dogs, are scared or skittish around so many things, or the fear is so intense, that it interferes with their enjoyment of daily life.\nDo these things to help your pup (and your guests) feel chill.\nWhy is my dog so fearful?\nWe wish we had a straight answer to this question. The reasons that dogs are fearful are exceedingly complex and very difficult to determine for an individual dog, much less for dogs in general.\nAny pup — purebred or mixed breed, male or female, young or old, rescue or from a breeder — can develop fear-based behaviors. That said, there is compelling evidence that any one of several factors can result in fearful dogs, including genetics.\nExperiments done with Pointers in the 1960s demonstrated that you can breed for fear of people in dogs.* Additionally, many dogs who are fearful have littermates or other relatives with this problem, which suggests a genetic predisposition.\nIt’s hard to tease apart the effects of early experiences and genetics. For example, an entire litter of puppies could also be fearful of people because they were raised with no opportunity to meet them;proper socializationcould have resulted in puppies without such fears.\nSocialization is indeed important: It’s critical to expose puppies to new people, places, animals, sounds, objects and anything else they are likely to encounter throughout their lives. As Dr. Estep succinctly puts it, “Positive early experiencesare critical for preventing fearfulness.” From ages three to 12 weeks, puppies are especially receptive to learning that the unfamiliar is not to be feared.\nNot all fears develop in puppyhood, however. At age eight, a Miniature Schnauzer named Maxine suddenly developed a fear of other dogs,reacting with barks, lunges, and growlswhenever a dog approached. She even reacted to her companion dog — a four-year-old Miniature Schnauzer who had been her playmate since being adopted as a puppy. I met Maxine when I was working at a dog camp and wondered if she was in pain, because sudden reactivity at an older age is consistent with thepresence of pain.\nWhen the camp veterinarian examined Maxine, she discovered inflammation along her spine and noted that she yelped when that spot was touched. A canine chiropractor treated Maxine, and once her health improved, so did her behavior. A dog who knows that it is going to hurt when dogs leap on them or roughhouse with them could react with behavior that’s intended to make the other dogs go away.\nNot surprisingly, negative experiences may also lead to fear. For example, a dog who is hit by a car may become afraid of cars. Similarly, a dog who accidentally knocks over a bunch of two-by-fours in the garage may develop a fear of any long object such as wood, brooms or shovels, or become afraid of the garage.\nCan dogs overcome their fears?\nThe good news for pet parents is that yes, dogs can overcome their fears. The bad news is that it takes a lot of work, patience, and understanding. It also requires a high level of proactivity, since these problems rarely resolve on their own. As Debbie Jacobs, animal behaviorist and author ofA Guide to Living With & Training a Fearful Dog, puts it, “Fear is an emotion and changing how a dog, or a person, feels about something is a challenge.” In most cases, professional help from a trainer or behaviorist who uses positive methods is a fundamental part of recovery.\nThere are so many misconceptions about treating fearfulness in dogs that before discussing what to do, it’s important to know what not to do. Ascribing to any of the following myths is detrimental to progress when working with a fearful dog.\nHere’s how your dog’s ears can clue you in to how they’re feeling.\nMisconceptions about fearful dogs\nExpecting a dog to “just get over it” is wishful thinking.\nThe behavior that most commonly elicits concerns of abuse in a dog’s past is that the dog is only scared of men. While it’s possible that a man has harmed the dog, fearful dogs are often more reactive to men than to women or to children, and this is particularly true of dogs whose socialization experiences were inadequate. It’s likely that men — with their larger size, deeper voices, and broader shoulders — appear more imposing to dogs.\nIt’s natural to assume that a dog who is scared of children has been teased by them, or that the only reason a dog would react badly to a broom is because of a terrifying experience with one. Yes, bad experiences sometimes lead to fear, but often, dogs are afraid of things that are new or unpredictable. So, the dog may fear children because they scream and move around in crazy ways, or they may fear brooms because he’s not used to them.\nPunishment will make the dog more fearful, and must not be used as a way to change any fear-based behavior. When bad things happen to a dog in the presence of what scares them, it makes the fear and the problem behavior worse, not better.\nIn some cases, and always under the supervision of a veterinarian,pharmacological interventionmay be appropriate, in conjunction with behavior modification and other techniques for helping fearful dogs. However, there is no magic pill that instantly cures fearfulness in dogs.\nWhen a dog refuses to get in a car or crate, resists allowing the vet to examine them, or won’t go down the steps to the basement, many people perceive their behavior as obstinate. But with fearful dogs, stubbornness is not the problem, any more than a kid standing on the high dive and refusing to jump is being mulish.\nStatus is a fact of life for many social species, but when dogs are afraid, their social standing is not the issue. Trying to fit all behavior problems under the heading of dominance does far more harm than good. Happily, more and more people recognize this perspective as outdated and counterproductive.\nCertified canine behavior consultant Pia Silvani’s comment on this common misconception is simple and to the point: “With all due respect, this does not make a bit of sense.” It is okay to reassure your dog that everything is fine in a calm and confident manner. To ignore them when they are clearly distressed is about as logical as refusing to hug your child when they wake up from a nightmare.\nThey are not going to become more fearful when they are reassured, but failing to do anything risks teaching them that you are not available when they need you most. Wilde tells her clients, “Be affectionate with your dog, but if you are overly worried, your dog will be, too. It’s fine to reassure your dog casually with an upbeat tone, but don’t coddle them with nervous energy.”\nThankfully, this is not true, but resolving a dog’s fear-based problem does take effort. As Jacobs puts it, “It’s not easy and it never happens as quickly as you’d like it to. It’s going to require more work, time and energy than you anticipated.” Many dogs recover completely, and still others improve greatly, though they may always remain on the cautious side; some situations may always be overwhelming and should be avoided.\nIf your dog loses their sh*t over anything—from a squirrel to a guest. Here are some tips to curtail that.\nSo, how can I help my fearful dog?\nPart of working with a fearful dog involves accepting that it’s hard to know how far a particular dog can go in overcoming the problem. If a pet parent expects that any dog can become happy-go-lucky, extroverted and confident, they may be disappointed in the future.\nAs Jacobs writes, “Changing our own views, beliefs, and expectations may be the first step the parent of a fearful dog needs to take.” To help a dog overcome fear, it is often most effective to combine several basic strategies.\nThe first step should be a thorough medical evaluation to determine if health problems are playing a role. Dogs who are in pain may develop fear of anything that exacerbates the pain, such as being touched, being approached by a playful dog, a leash or collar, or asport class like agility.\nOlder dogs may develop fears and phobias following physical changes, including cognitive deterioration orloss of sightor hearing. A myriad of other physical problems can be in play as well, and any underlying medical issue should be resolved.\nThis may involve being an advocate for your dog, such as stopping strangers from petting them or refusing to let a family member use power tools until you get the dog out of the house. Management of the environment is a lot of work, but it’s work that pays big dividends. Protecting a dog from exposure to situations that scare them is a great way to start, because every time a fearful dog becomes afraid, the problem is compounded.\nAnd as Jaak Panksepp, neuroscientist, psychobiologist, and author ofAffective Neuroscience: The Foundations of Human and Animal Emotions, once said, “One of the most horrible experiences of life is to be stricken by sudden terror. Another is to be continually consumed by the persistent feelings of anxiety that gnaw away at you, destroying your sense of security in the world.”\nFor dogs who are reactive to the point of snapping or biting, preventing situations in which the dog feels the need to do this is essential for the safety of others as well as for the well being of the dog.\nIt’s not going to help, and it may make the situation worse, adding yet another scary experience that confirms your pup’s belief that something is worth being afraid of. Wilde advises that we allow the dog to make the decision about approaching or avoiding a potentially scary situation.\nDeveloping your dog’s confidence can help them overcome their fearfulness because these two states of being are not compatible. Anything that allows a dog to experience success is good for their self esteem and adds to their self-assurance. Training dogs to perform behaviors on cue — standard obedience exercises, targeting, responding to their names or performing tricks — can build confidence.\nSo can getting their nourishment fromfood-reward puzzlesorfood-stuffed toys, because accessing the food is an accomplishment. Play is also a way to help dogs feel confident. Once a fearful dog is comfortable enough to happily engage in play, a positive feedback loop develops. The more they play, the more confident they are, and the more confident they are, the more they play.\nThese techniques are often the core treatment for fearful dogs. Systematic desensitization is a structured way of repeatedly exposing your dog to something that they fear, but starting at a low level so that fear is not induced. Then, gradually, during many sessions over a period of weeks, months or even years, the intensity of what frightens them is increased so that they can get used to it at each level before moving on to the next.\nScary things are made less scary by being smaller, slower, quieter, farther away or otherwise less intense. Exposing your dog to what frightens them at an intensity level that is too low to induce their fear is completely different than forcing they to confront what he fears by overdoing it and actually scaring them. (For details on these techniques, McConnell’s booklet,The Cautious Canine, is a great resource.)\nClassical counterconditioning consists of pairing up what frightens the dog with something the dog loves more than anything else; eventually, the dog realizes that the scary thing predicts the wonderful thing. If your dog fears people, then every time he sees someone, they should immediately receive atheir favorite treator highly prized toy or other item. Eventually, the dog will have a positive emotional reaction to seeing a person, because they know that something good is about to happen.\nExposing your dog to the trigger that scares them, starting at very low levels of intensity and gradually working up to more intense exposures, is most effective. In practice, desensitization and classical counterconditioning are often done together.\nSome dogs progress rapidly, but others make progress that can only be detected when viewed long-term, over years or perhaps over the dog’s entire life. No matter which pattern describes your dog, it’s important to work gradually, and as Wilde says, “go at the dog’s pace.” You must only move to more intense triggers when the dog is clearly comfortable at the previous level of exposure. Fearful dogs must be handled carefully and with endless patience.\nMost behaviorists and trainers agree that in addition to specific behavior modification, a good foundation for helping dogs overcome their fears is built from many aspects of their daily life. Good nutrition, regular exercise and predictable routines are all helpful. Other potentially calming, therapeutic techniques or alternativetherapies include massage, anxiety wraps, Bach flower essences, homeopathic remedies, acupuncture, and Traditional Chinese Medicine.\nWhether or not you believe in crystal healing, Chani Ronez’s chic, customizable, and sustainable products are designed to help treat everything from separation anxiety to joint pain to GI issues.\nHow much will my dog improve?\nAlmost all fearful dogs can improve, but the degree to which a dog overcomes their fear depends on many factors. Dr. Estep and Wilde agree that the human partner is a huge factor in the eventual outcome. Motivation is critical for success, as is an understanding of the situation and the amount of time the person is willing to commit to it. The use of gentle, positive methods is also linked with improvement. Mild fears or those of recent development have a higher likelihood of successful resolution. The dog’s genetics play a role as well; the stronger the genetic component of the dog’s fears, the harder it may be to overcome them.\nWilde sums up the basic approach to helping fearful dogs: “It takes time and patience. Always be gentle, positive and kind. Never, ever use physical force or corrections.” Jacobs echoes this advice: “Your dog’s trust in you is the most important building block in the foundation for building their confidence. Never use any type of punishment or correction which scares or intimidates your dog.”\nThough it can be gut-wrenching to watch a dog live in fear, there are also positive aspects, and that may be part of the reason why some people are drawn to fearful dogs. Wilde has a long-standing history of relating to them: “I always had an empathy for the fearful ones. I was drawn to the shaking dog in the corner.” She points out that having a fearful dog “teaches you a lot about subtleties of canine body language. You become tuned into your dog. You learn to manage things. You gain increased empathy for your dog. You expand your knowledge and patience.”\nHelping a dog who lives in fear is a common undertaking — many pet parents, knowingly or not, end up living with a dog who is afraid. To succeed in treating a fearful dog so that they can conquer their fears requires knowledge, consistent effort and extraordinary patience. It’s not easy, but it’s gratifying to see the difference in a dog who has been the beneficiary of this hard work.\nWhile it is an experience that is likely to have lows that are lower and highs that are higher than expected, many pet parents report that it is immensely rewarding to work with their dogs and help them overcome their fears. As though we needed further convincing that dogs of all types, including the fearful ones, enrich our lives!\nFinal takeaway — 10 things to remember if you have a fearful dog\nBe patient — it can take a long time for dogs to overcome their fears.\nBe patient — it can take a long time for dogs to overcome their fears.\nCommit to helping your dog by putting in the time and effort to treat their fears.\nCommit to helping your dog by putting in the time and effort to treat their fears.\nDon’t force your dog into situations that you know induce fear.\nDon’t force your dog into situations that you know induce fear.\nBe open to the variety of techniques that may help your dog conquer their fears.\nBe open to the variety of techniques that may help your dog conquer their fears.\nHandle any relevant medical issues.\nHandle any relevant medical issues.\nBe gentle, positive and kind.\nBe gentle, positive and kind.\nNever use punishment.\nNever use punishment.\nProtect your dog from scary situations.\nProtect your dog from scary situations.\nAccept that many fearful dogs never become gregarious, go-with-the-flow types.\nAccept that many fearful dogs never become gregarious, go-with-the-flow types.\nLove your dog for who they are.\nLove your dog for who they are.\nReferences:\nHelp for Your Fearful Dog\nHelp for Your Fearful Dog\nFor the Love of a Dog: Understanding Emotion in You and Your Best Friend\nFor the Love of a Dog: Understanding Emotion in You and Your Best Friend\nThe Cautious Canine\nThe Cautious Canine\nA Guide to Living With & Training a Fearful Dog\nA Guide to Living With & Training a Fearful Dog",

  "page_content": "As someone who works remotely, I have a serious at-home office setup. It includes a large desk holding multiple monitors with the type of elaborately comfy chair previously reserved for Twitch streamers. The downside to these long-sought-after luxuries is that I rarely use them because my dog can’t get close enough to me when I do. If I don’t sit on the couch, bed, or somewhere else she can curl up next to me all day, she will have a full-on emotional meltdown.\nBeyond increasing my back pain by about 5,000 percent, two things have become abundantly clear from this routine. One, I am a very weak man when faced with a sad dog. And two, my pup is way too attached. So, I enlisted the counsel of two experts to help reduce my dog’s clinginess at home.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nYour dog’s Velcro habits are cute—but not always convenient.\nWhy some dogs stick to your side\nThere are copious reasons why your dog may possess Velcro-like qualities. Susan Nilson, animal trainer and founder ofThe Cat and Dog House, confirms that this behavior is completely normal and, in many cases, just reflects how much they like you (aww).\nHowever, she offers an important caveat: “There is such a thing as being over-attached.” Nilson explains that dogs will often follow their pet parents around simply because they like being near them and are curious about what they’re up to.\nThese animals could also be anticipating something exciting like being fed or going for a walk. Not to mention, if they follow you around all day, they’re more likely to receive pets or other types of attention, which only leads them to repeat this behavior. So, as difficult as it can feel, it’s imperative to resist rewarding this behavior and other neediness staples,like whining.\nOn a less charming note, your pup might be clinging to you because they’re stressed or scared. As the one who takes care of them, they look to you for protection and reassurance.\n“Dogs, like children, tend to use their owners as a secure base, a bit like a security blanket,” Nilson says. Dr. Sabrina Kong, a veterinarian atJules Veterinary Centerin Tracy, California, explains that a lack of confidence or recent changes to their environment could be factors, as well.\n“Some dogs become clingy if they’re not used to being alone or experienced loss or change, such as moving to a new home or changing the family dynamic,” she says. In short, maybe you should stay togetherfor the kids.\nIf they’re following you around like your shadow, there’s a reason for that.\nAin’t no sunshine when you’re gone\nOf course, if this behavior is consistent every day, there’s likely a larger issue at play. Your pup could be suffering from separation anxiety, a condition I think we all know alittle too well. Unfortunately, Nilson notes that remedying this situation and managing its symptoms can be a delicate dance. According to the trainer, “separation anxiety needs a carefully structured approach to build up the length of time the dog can manage alone without being stressed.”\nAbove all, she recommends hiring a professional to help guide you and your dog through the process. But if you’re unable to do so due to time constraints or because you spent all your excess money on pain relief medication for your back, like me, the overarching goal is to help your pup feel safe when they’re alone.\nFor Nilson, this ideally involves a carefully tailored plan of desensitization and counterconditioning, in which you gradually increase the length of time your dog spends alone while rewarding calm and independent behavior.\nBut it’s important to remember that dog training is not a Vin Diesel movie and speed should not be the goal. “There is no timeline for this. We simply go at the dog’s pace and need to resist any temptation to rush things along,” she adds.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nShort-term solutions\nThat approach is all fine and dandy, but in the interim, most of us still have things to do, places to go, and backs to have massaged. Thankfully, there are short-term Band-Aid solutions to help limit this behavior in the present so you can still get some work done.\nNilson explains that providing amentally stimulating toyis often the best option in these scenarios. Offering your dog something like a snuffle mat or fillable toy will help keep them occupied while you do the dishes, exercise, or work to pay for their special tummy-sensitive dog food.\nNilson specificallysuggests a Kongor LickiMat;  they can be filled and frozen overnight to pose a greater and longer-lasting challenge. She explains that these tools arenatural stress relieversthat give pups a boost of endorphins. “When dogs are presented with a task where they have to engage their logical, thinking brain, it inhibits the emotional brain, meaning not only will they be happily distracted but also that they will be calmer and more relaxed overall.”\nEstablishing a scent game is another effective strategy to keep your dog occupied. Plus, Nilson points out that this can be done in a separate room apart from the one you’re trying to be productive in. These games involve scattering or hiding treats and allowing your pup to use their nose to find them.\nIt might even improve their health, as Nilson explains: “Research shows that sniffing lowers a dog’s pulse rate and blood pressure so this is another easy way to provide a mental challenge which will help keep your dog distracted and calm.”\nOther options include offering your dog something with your scent on it to provide additional comfort. Personally, I stopped lending clothes after losing my vintageGet Up Kidst-shirt to an ex, but I can make an exception here. “Dogs feel more secure when surrounded by their familiar scents and this is an easy way to help your dog feel more secure if they’re feeling anxious,” Nilson says. She also mentions dog-specific music or playlists you can find on YouTube or Spotify as effective tools to help further induce calmness.\nWhat to do when you don’t feel the close bond you want.\nHow to train your dog to be slightly more independent\nIf your dog was recently adopted or is still a puppy, you may be able to takeThe Terminatorroute and stop these issues before they ever develop. Dr. Kong explains that preventing this behavior requires proper socialization and training early on.\n“Encouraging independence, rewarding calm behavior, and avoiding reinforcing needy behavior inadvertently are crucial. Ensure your dog has a well-rounded life with plenty of social interactions, physical exercise, and mental stimulation,” she says.\nAdditionally, an early focus on commands like “stay” or “go to bed” will help teach your pet that being away from you is normal.I get it — it can behard to say goodbyewhen you leave, and coming home to a dog losing their mind about your resumed presence is a singularly wonderful experience. But Dr. Kong confirms these habits are not always in your pup’s best interest long-term. “It’s also fundamental to practice leaving and returning home without making a big fuss, which can help minimize anxiety related to your comings and goings,” she says.\nThe appeal of clingy dogs is clear: Everybody likes to feel needed. But it’s important to remember that it’s in everyone’s best interest if your pet can be a bit more independent. If not for them, do it for the health of your back. Take it from me — yoga classes only go so far.",

  "page_content": "As someone with a Pit Bull who would rather hold in her pee for 18 hours than go outside when it’s barely drizzling, I can confirm dogs are mostly big babies. No matter how tough they may seem or present themselves to other pups, I’ve never met a pet parent whose dog didn’t have at least one quirky phobia. Sure, everybody knows that dogs are easily spooked byfireworks, thunderstorms, or a trip to the vet. But for many, those are simply a baseline.\n“Dogs, like any animal, have the potential to become afraid of anything,” explains Renee Rhoades, applied animal behaviorist atR+Dogs. While some of these fears can certainly reflect larger behavioral concerns, Rhoades notes that others develop mainly because they’re unfamiliar to the animal.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n“Contrary to popular belief, dogs do not become afraid of things simply from negative interactions with them. They can also become afraid of things that they have never encountered before,” she adds.\nJust like us, dogs fear the unknown. According to Dr. Anna Kaufman, a veterinarian atBond Vet,this can include anything from new noises to fresh experiences previously unfamiliar to the pup. Sometimes this might be another animal and other times it’ll be a human invention they’ve yet to encounter. To be clear, none of that is to say more serious or damaging memories can’t have lasting effects as well. “If a dog experienced a trauma, this might cause fear reactions later on,”Dr. Kaufman confirms.\nEmotional distress aside, there are plenty of strange things that frighten dogs that are somewhat harmless. And for some of these, the true reason behind the fear isn’t always easy or even possible to pin down. As Dr. Kaufman puts it, “Every dog is unique, and that is why we love them.”\nSo, we gathered a few experts to see which fears might be as popular as they are peculiar.\nHow to keep your dog mentally and physically safe this New Year.\nThings that scare dogs\nAnyone who has tried the debilitating exercise that is cleaning your home with a canine bystander knows how many pups view vacuum cleaners. Whether it’s the unfamiliarity or volume of the noise vacuums produce, dogs view them as a sign of the end times.\n“[Dogs] can be afraid of common items that humans use daily, like the vacuum, but if they are unfamiliar with that item and the sounds they make, it can cause fear,” explains Michelle Bernstein, an animal behavior scientist atVCA Animal Hospitals. I can personally confirm that some pets are equally opposed to the next evolutionary step in vacuum cleaning: my dog hates my Roomba. To be fair, I do share her fears of AI and the impending robot apocalypse.\nI simplified it to planes, but this really extends to anything human-made and airborne, to be honest. As Leigh Siegfried, the founder and training director ofOpportunity Barks, explains, it all comes down to the sounds they make that can terrify dogs. Plus, they have a suspicious astonishment at the miracle of human flight.\n“Sometimes, they fear things like helicopters, planes, or hot air balloons, just any unanticipated objects in the sky that might be noisy or making noise,” Siegfried says. Luckily, theopportunities to flywith your dog are growing by the day so hopefully that will help them become morecomfortable with the concept.\nThis one’s slightly more serious and might reflect larger issues that should be handled with guidance from a professional. If ignored, these anxieties will only deepen and snowball into real behavioral concerns. Not to mention, Bernstein notes that this dread can often be coupled with — somewhat ironically — fears of solitude, which will really complicate your pup’s social life. “Dog can be afraid of strangers and being alone which can develop into behavior issues like separation anxiety and aggression,” she says.\nSome dogs are particularly afraid of men. While it’s usually due to previous trauma or a lack of socialization, I do understand the hesitation. As someone who has unfortunately dabbled with dating apps, I can confirm the men on those things are absolutely insane. So, I do get why other species would grow weary of the human male gender.\nPet parents know that not every pup likes to — or can — swim. It’s only natural some would have adverse feelings toward taking a dip or seeing water in general, especially when you consider how most react during the bathing process.\nBut Dr. Kaufman notes that, for some dogs, it’s the things that have seemingly conquered the water that are the scariest to them. “Some dogs don’t like water, some dogs are frightened by balloons or things that float,” she says.\nYou’d think the canine population would unanimously support a toy with which they have long been associated, but this is why it’s important not to stereotype. Sure, no one is suggesting that dogs are routinely terrified of tennis balls or any other round device they can fit in their mouths.\nBut if pups aren’t used to balls being big and bouncy, it can freak them out. “Some dogs are scared of any noise such as a basketball bouncing near them — all depends on the dog,” Dr. Kaufman says.\nResearch finds why dogs may suddenly become super sensitive to sounds.\nHow to handle quirky fears\nStrange as some of these may appear, it’s important to understand that any dog battling one of these fears is enduring real emotional distress. That terror is genuine, no matter how silly the item that’s inspiring it. As a result, pet parents should respond appropriately with care, even if they’re laughing a little through it.\nAccording to Siegfried, your first step when faced with a petrified dog should not be avoidance as appealing as it may seem. “If they have a big reaction to something, don’t let them run away. I know that sounds counterintuitive. But keeping the dog with you, helping them recover, and then moving away together builds resilience to recover,” she explains.\nHowever, that does not mean forcing your dog to do something they’re fearful of. This is not only cruel but will likely make the issue worse. Instead, pet parents should learn how to properly comfort their dogs. Siegfried explains that this often comes down to reassurance, calming your pup and letting them know everything is going to be fine. “It’s like a kid who fell off the monkey bars at a playground and is upset and could benefit from a pickup and a hug,” she says.\nThis summer, your pup deserves a little support.\nWhat you can do to ease their stress\nRhoades adds that you might have heard the advice that comforting a scared dog will eventually make the anxiety worse. She advises you to ignore this particular counsel; it’s entirely inaccurate. The fact that your pet is looking to you at these times is realistically a great indication of your overall bond.\n“What is happening is your dog is feeling comfortable enough to show their distress, so although it may feel that they are getting worse they are actually trusting you to support them,” she says.\nNow, there are a few methods to help pups better face their fears. Dr. Kaufman recommends investing in products like thunder shirts or calming collars for longer periods of exposure, as well as talking to your vet aboutcalming medicationsthat can be given prior to stressful events.\nBernstein also advocates for creating a safe space, a place in the home your pup can retreat to where they’ll always feel protected. Then, if necessary, you can slowly introduce them to what they’re afraid of while they feel secure. “Providing them with a safe space to explore and learn about something fearful will help your dog gain trust in you that the fearful thing might be safe, too,” she says. “You want your dog to trust you so they can learn to trust the thing they fear.”\nOf course, sometimes what seems like a silly little fear can also be a serious one. Rhoades warns that if your dog is struggling with day-to-day activities, losing sleep, or not eating, they may have a larger issue. Basically, if their behavior has worsened in an area unrelated to the direct fear, you should consider reaching out to a vet or trainer for help.",

  "page_content": "We humans are naturally anxious creatures. It’s the reason why people might avoid social gatherings, overthink past actions, or enjoy Phoebe Bridgers' music. I am personally burdened by a rotating set of fear-induced daily queries like,Is my dog truly happy?,Am I giving her enough exercise?, andHow can I ensure she outlives me?\nSure, there are concerns beyond pet parenthood, but they’re far less crippling. And come bedtime, these feelings only intensify. It’s been somewhat reassuring, then, to discover that dogs are also kept up at night by their worried little minds. In fact, they might also stress to the extent that it impacts their quality of sleep, which actually makes me more anxious now that I think about it. Unconditional love is exhausting.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nCo-sleeping with your pet has both positive and negative effects.\nDogs have nighttime panic, too.\nThis equally fascinating and upsetting discovery stems from the findings of a2017 studyconducted by Hungarian researchers. A team with the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest examined the relationship between emotional state and sleep patterns in dogs.\nThey recruited 16 pups and presented them with either a positive or negative experience before sleep. Nine of the participants were male while seven were female across varying breeds. Each dog was tested twice throughout the process.\nTo emulate a positive experience, dogs were treated togames of fetch or tug, as well as lots of pets. The negative experiences, however, involved being left alone in a room, ignored entirely by those present, or offered threatening body language by a stranger.\nSo, you can add the treatment of research animals in Hungary to my extensive list of anxieties. After exposure to one of these events, the dogs were taken to a room that they were previously made familiar with for a well-earned nap of up to three hours. At this point in the study, researchers attached noninvasive (thankfully) electrodes to the pups to monitor their brain activity as they slept.\nDogs: They’re not just like us.\nThe deeper the trauma, the shallower the sleep.\nOn average, the researchers found that following negative experiences dogs spent 20 minutes less in deep sleep. It makes sense: Most people can struggle with sleep after a stressful day. Not to mention, if, one day, everyone I encountered either ignored me or tried to intimidate me, I’d be pretty spooked too. And the professionals seem to agree.\n“There are times when dog owners report that their furry friend seems restless at night after something stressful, like a vet visit. But after a fun day of playing fetch or getting lots of cuddles, they sleep soundly and seem more relaxed,” says Iram Gladan, a PhD researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands and veterinarian withBreed Atlas.\nShe notes other stressors that might impact sleep include loud noises, unfamiliar environments, or negative interactions with other animals before calling out the species’ long-time nemesis. “Fireworks areknown to be a major problemfor all pets, especially dogs.\" Afterevents like Fourth of July, she says she has noticed that many dogs sleep poorly due to the loud fireworks and other loud stressors.\nSusan Nilson, trainer and founder ofThe Cat and Dog House, explains that emotions, like fear, anxiety, stress, or even frustration can all play a role in how pups sleep by activating a fight-or-flight response. This results in increased heart rate, blood flow to muscles, and a release of adrenaline that can mess with the animal at a chemical level.\nA lot of these emotions stem from the dog feeling unsafe, so Nilson offers a simple solution most effective if rolled out early. “That’s why I always recommend that dog owners who have just adopted a dog start by creating a safe space where the dog can retreat at will to decompress, regroup, and start to relax as he learns that he is safe in this new, unfamiliar environment with new, unfamiliar people,” she says.\nThere are pros and cons of sleeping with your dog — for both of you.\nNegative experiences kickstart (restless) slumber.\nThat being said, one of the study’s unexpected discoveries was that dogs who had just endured a negative experience fell asleep faster than those following a positive one. Despite their overall quality of sleep being diminished, negative experiences appeared to wipe the animals out. Beyond that, this was also followed by roughly 10 percent longer periods of sleep. Although, again, they spent less time in deep, restful sleep, which isn’t great.\nThe study implies that dogs may use sleep as a protective strategy against concerns of the day, kind of like how I avoid therapy sessions with long naps. Nilson confirms that sleeping can be a coping mechanism for worried pups, but it’s only one of several displacement behaviors they often exhibit.\n“So, you might see a dog engage in excess sniffing, drinking, or yes, sleeping, as a way of trying to reduce stress or tension arising from conflicting emotions or to provide an escape from an unpleasant or aversive situation,” she explains.\nGladan adds that this habit could also be a simple reaction to the exhaustion that follows high-stress situations, like someone crashing on the couch after putting in extra hours at the office. “This is similar to how humans might feel the need to nap after a particularly draining day,” she says.\nAnd just like us, dogs need quality sleep to properly support their physical and mental health. “During sleep, a dog’s body repairs and regenerates tissues, supports immune function, and processes the day’s experiences, which is vital for learning and memory,” she adds.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nPlay and attention help them get a quality snooze later.\nClearly, our pups need plenty of quality sleep to function. Quite a bit of it, in fact. Per Gladan, dogs need at least 12 to 14 hours of sleep each day. Depending on their age, however, they might need evenmore. For example, young puppies will require more zs to support their growth in the same way older pooches need more to aid their aging bodies. A fact that this 30-something finds all too familiar.\nAs the study showed, physical exercise is one of the best ways to enhance our pets’ sleep. Nilson confirms as much, noting that play is a great counter to negative emotions, particularly fear, and is a useful resource to help switch dogs from a negative emotional state to a positive one.\nAt the same time, mental stimulation can be used to attack sleep killing anxieties at the source. “Activities like sniffing, licking, and chewing are known stress busters in dogs so they can help dogs feel more relaxed and potentially improve sleep quality,” she explains.\nGladan also emphasizes the importance of exercise, both physical and mental, when trying to boost a dog’s sleep. But, like anyone with an AI girlfriend can tell you, nothing compares to the comfort of genuine love. “Of course, spending quality time with their owners helps them feel loved and secure, reducing anxiety and promoting relaxation,” she adds.\nDogs need more sleep than humans. Here’s how much is healthy.\nIs your dog stressing out before passing out?\nNow, I’d assume most people don’t have electrode devices at the ready to document the quality of their pet’s sleep. The best we can do is keep an eye out during the day for signs that our pupsmight be experiencing stressthat could potentially carry over into their dreamscapes.\nNilson recommends looking for changes in posture and expression, specifically with the eyes, ears, mouth, tail, and fur. These subtle cues can include sweaty paws, yawning when not tired,panting when not hot, excessive shedding, pacing, avoiding eye contact, widening of the tongue aka spatulate tongue, or whale eye which occurs when the whites of their eyes are showing.\nGladan points to otherphysical signslike a tucked tail, flattened ears, or tense posture as indications your dog is stressed. Destructive behaviors,like chewing furniture, might also suggest anxiety, as well as increased vocalization like barking or whining more than usual.\nUnfortunately, these actions can create a bit of a vicious cycle: Gladan warns that quality sleep is crucial to regulating a dog’s mood and reducing their stress levels. Over time, these issues will only cause them to be more anxious or irritable if ignored. New behavioral problems, a weakened immune system, and possibly shortened life are also risks of consistently limited sleep quality.\nSo, it’s imperative to keep your pup happy, healthy, and happily sleeping. As Gladan puts it, “After all, a dog that sleeps well wags well.”",

  "page_content": "When my kids were young, it made them happy to hear me groan about a looming deadline. They knew from experience they would get to watch movies until the writing gods smiled on me enough to complete whatever I was working on.\nFor that reason, you’ll never hear any judgment from me about plopping kids in front of screens from time to time — you do what you have to do! That’s why I say, to those holier-than-thou parents out there criticizing screen time for kids, “I’m not interested in your thoughts on the matter, thanks.”\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nCriticism about screen time is just a part of parenting in the modern world, as is disagreement about how much is too much. If you’re interested in a social experiment, try yelling at a group of parents with any assertion about how much TV time is too much for kids and see all hell break loose while they all descend into unhinged arguments.\nNow, it looks like we might get to have the same debate and be shamed for our choices as pet parents — because aJanuary study revealsthat dogsalsolove spending time in front of that glowing monitor of endless entertainment.\nIsAnimal Planetreally their favorite channel?\nDogs love TV.\nIn the study, over 1,200 people filled out a survey about their dogs and their interest in a variety of activities, such as animals, ball sports, non-ball sports, and vehicles. These same people answered questions about their dogs’ reactions to four videos of movement going across a screen, of a dog, a bird, traffic, and a panther.\nDogs had a lot of different reactions to the videos, according to the surveys. It’s common for dogs to turn their head to the side and prick their ears, to vocalize, or to approach the screen. Over three-quarters of dogs in the study performed each of these behaviors. Over one-quarter of them looked behind the screen or around the side of it or touched the screen with their nose. Just a few (about one in 20) of the dogs brought a toy to the screen or ran away from the screen.\nAlmost half of the people who participated in the study play videos or leave the TV on for their dogs when they are home alone. Seventeen percent of the people play dog-specific content,like DogTV, for their dogs. There were nearly as many people who provided screen time for their dogs in their absence (48 percent) as those who providedinteractive toysfor their dogs (57 percent), which gives you some idea how popular the strategy is for entertaining dogs.\nYes, dogs can see muted colors.\nThey really love watching other dogs on the screen.\nJust like me when I couldn’t pull away from that long-awaitedTed Lassoseries finale, dogs get excited about what's on TV. They pay a lot of attention to screens, especially when animals are in the videos. Unsurprisingly, they are enchanted by dogs most of all. People who filled out the surveys reported that their pups loved the movement on the screen and aren’t as interested in the sound. In fact, a number of the people surveyed in the study reported that their dogs were just as interested in watching activity on screens when the sound was off as when it was on.\nLike kids, all dogs are susceptible to getting sucked into movies, videos, and social media, but some may be a bit more than others. Young dogs are more likely to be into watching screens than older dogs. Herding and sporting breeds are most likely to be into screens compared with other groups of dogs. Dogs with good vision were more interested in their screens as well.\nIt’s not all black and white.\nIs too much screen time a bad thing for dogs?\nScreens can entertain dogs, but it should not get in the way of their other needs, such as being outside, getting lots of exercise, playing, being social, and training time. So, while there’s not a firm rule about how much screen time is too much, it should only be a supplement to making their days interesting. It should not be the main way to stimulate your dog’s brain but is just an additional tool for making their life interesting.\nTV can help keep dogs occupied when they are alone, but it’s not going to be effective at treating separation anxiety. And, it’s not going to be stimulating enough to get you off the hook for walks, play time, and teaching them new skills. They need time to be outside and active, with the amount of exercise depending on their age and activity level — so make sure screen time is not cutting into those activities. Too much screen time is bad for dogs if it’s taking away from other quality activities — theyreally are like little kids. Looks like screen-time rules should be implemented for thewholefamily now.\nReferences:\nScreen Interaction Behavior in Companion Dogs: Results From a Dog Owner Survey",

On the other hand,more dogs(andpets in general) go missing on this holiday than any other day of the year, which, unfortunately, is very much connected to the whole cowboy-hat-fireworks thing. Another thing that happens in this country? Fireworks tend to go off at random times throughout the summer, not just on federal holidays.\n“Similar to thunderstorms,fireworks causingloud, unpredictable noises can be interpreted as a threat to dogs, causing them to hide, show signs of anxiety (panting, trembling, pacing, whining), or run,” Dr. Gabrielle Fadl, veterinarian, and director of primary care at Bond Vet in New York Citytold us in 2023.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nBecause of our dogs’ sensitive hearing, the anxiety-inducing noise of fireworks can be out of the control of pet parents, even when keeping pets inside. However, what is in our control are the tools we use to mitigate our dogs’ anxiety on Independence Day. To help, we’ve compiled a list of our go-to anti-anxiety products for the Big Day of Horribly Loud Sounds.\nAnd, of course, if you thinkanxiety meds, like trazodone, could be helpful, please talk to your vet about that.

They contain melatonin, which can help keep your pup snoozing away happily as fireworks stretch into the night.\nSustainable\nGives Back\nAdaptil’s pheromone diffusers have become a go-to remedy for pet parents with anxious dogs. Many praise the product for its quick-acting ability, as one reviewer detailed on Amazon: “After about 30 minutes of diffusing this, my dog was definitely more relaxed. He went from barking his head off at anyone who entered the room to walking over to sniff them, then settling down on the couch.”\nPercertified dog trainer Lindsay Hamrick, these diffusers are effective because theyreplicate the pheromonesthat a mother dog secretes from her sebaceous glands while nursing. “Do they hide under your bed when those Fourth of July fireworks go off? Spray Adaptil near that area to help support them,” she adds. —Sean Zucker\nA blanket that comes with its own heartbeat might seem creepy to you — but not to your pup!

Add the recommended amount for their weight to their meal or snack to get them feeling stress-free with this homeopathic solution long before the pretty colors light up the sky.\n“I have a very nervous pooch who suffers with anxiety really bad,” one Amazonreviewer wrote. “He shakes in winter because of the rain and thunderstorms. He shakes continuously if I have workers come to the house and if there are people working outside mowing lawns, etc. Since having purchased Rescue Remedy, I find that he is more subdued and happy to lay in his bed after I have given him some.”\nThere’s a reason it was our2023 Best in Showwinner for Best Calming Serum.\nSustainable\nProperly worn earmuffs are the gold standard of noise reduction when it comes to fireworks. Available in small through XL and with the ability to reduce noise up to 86 percent, this pair by derYEP is a great choice for pets of all sizes. Keep in mind that your dog will most likely need some training to tolerate wearing these, so if possible, try to work with them ahead of time. For your sanity and your dog’s, we don’t recommend starting this training at 7 p.m. on July 4th.\nWomen Owned\nSmall Business\nSnuffle mats are ubiquitous as the go-to enrichment toy, but did you know this type of toy can really help them zone out the rest of their stressors, including lots of guests, loud noises, and the fact that you won’tfeed them every hot dogfrom the grill.

  "page_content": "As pet parents, many of us know what comes after the lightning during a storm: absolute terror in our dogs as they anticipate the thunder. That terror can take the shape of trembling, hiding under the coffee table, howling, and other expressions of doggie dread. And who knows what happens when we’re not home and a sudden thunderstorm descends (the horror!).\nBut for many dogs, storms bring panic and fear. Sometimes this fear even extends to the precursors to thunder, like dark skies, lightning, or changes in barometric pressure. We totally understand the loudboomscan be scary, but is there something else that our canines are reacting to?\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nExperts hypothesize that some dogs are particularly sensitive to noise; another explanation is that the storms can cause static buildup in their fur that causes a shock sensation.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nUnderstanding the fear.\nVeterinarian Dr. Nancy Dreschel,  an associate teaching professor at PennState,published a studyon the reactions of thunderstorm phobic dogs. She investigated the common stress signs of dogs during thunderstorms, including pacing, salivating, panting, trembling, whining, hiding, and increased salivary cortisol levels.\nThe small study found having a sympathetic owner does not lower the stress reaction of dogs who become anxious or fearful during noisy thunderstorms. But dogs who live with other dogs were more likely to have less pronounced stress reactions and more rapid recovery than dogs in single-dog households. That’s good news for dogs living in multi-dog homes. But Dr. Dreschel cautions pet parents of dogs with thunderstorm anxiety against getting additional dogs.\nEven though it seems that comfort from humans (like petting and speaking calmly) didn’t lower stress levels, Dr. Dreschel found that dogs would still seek this comfort.\n “Many of the dogs in our study (both those who lived with other dogs and those who were the only dog) sought out this type of comforting from their human companions.”\nFireworks and thunderstorms aren’t the only things that make them say,“No, thanks!”\nTips for soothing your dog during a storm\nSo, what can you do to help comfort your fearful pup before and during a thunderstorm? “For dogs with thunderstorm phobia… offering a safe place to go (covered crate, basement, etc.), behavior modification (counter-conditioning and desensitization), pheromone therapy and anti-anxiety medication,” Dr. Dreschel suggests.\nYou know best what helps your pup calm down: petting them, praising them, scratching their favorite spot under their chin. Some pups respond positively when you play soothing music.\nYou can try drowning out the sound with the TV (DogTVhas special programming for pups) or a fan — there are even canine noise-reducing headphones, such asMutt Muffs, to muffle storm noises.\nPlan to be home if you know a storm is coming so you can keep your pup occupied with their favorite tug toy or byfilling a Kongwith their favorite treats. Make sure your pup gets some exercise, too, to get rid of that anxious energy.\nHumans joke about these things, but they really can help: theThundershirtorAnxiety Wrapare the equivalent of swaddling your pup like a baby, applying gentle pressure to calm their nerves..\nAs a long-term solution, the American Humane recommendscounter-conditioningyour dog to thunderstorms as a preventative measure. It’s essentially training your pup to display a different behavior than their current reaction to a stimulus (aka the thunder.) You probably want to consult a trainer for this, as it involves exposing your dog to the scary sound at a low volume, gradually increasing it as you reward them with a toy or treats.\nIf your dog has a serious fear, you should always speak to your veterinarian, who can potentially recommend anti-anxiety medicine or herbal remedies.\nReferences:\nCounter-Conditioning and Desensitization",

  "page_content": "Memorial Day marks the (technically unofficial) start of summer. We grill, we take our first dips in the pool, we go to parades, and we generally allow vitamin D back into our lives. Like everything, pet parents have to think about a few other concerns before the merriment can begin. Otherwise, they’ll be spending the long weekend in theER waiting roomwhile their pet is treated for an array of holiday-induced emergencies.\nI’ve seen pets come in with serious lacerations from jumping through glass windows, high-rise fall injuries from leaping from balconies, car-impact trauma from attempting to flee from large crowds, dietary indiscretions from stealing scraps from the grill, and cases ofsevere anxietydue to overwhelming stimulation.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nIn addition to the trauma that I see, I also receive many phone calls from distressed pet parents trying tolocate their lost dogor cat after they’ve run away from home in a panicked state. Sorry, didn’t mean to completely freak you out. Just follow these nine tips to keep tabs on your pet this Memorial Day weekend, so the only thing you have to worry about is not burning the burgers.\nSure, microchips can feel a little1984. But if your pup has a chip, they’re four times more likely to make it home if they get lost.\nKeep your pet safe and secure (read: inside).\nWhile fireworks are more often associated withthe Fourth of July, many Memorial Day parades and celebrations include them as well. If you live out of earshot of major firework presentations, don’t forget that even small neighborhood displays can be just as distressing to your pets. Make sure your pets are secured indoors and as far away from the noise as possible.\nIf your dog iscrate trained, put them intheir crateand cover it with a blanket for an added feeling of security. You can also help block the sights and sounds outside simply by lowering the blinds and turning on the TV. Don’t forget that a fenced-in pet will still look for a way to escape the yard during times of extreme stress. And if you plan to go to a friend’s home for the festivities, leave your pet at home.\nMake sure your pet is microchipped (and registered).\nBe sure that your pet can be identified in case they do escape. If you don’t already have a name tag for your dog, most local pet supply stores can make one on the spot.Microchipping your petis the best way to them find their way back home if they are missing — in fact, they are four times more as likely to!\nSome like it hot (but not most dogs). Here are the season’s health hazards, from fleas to foxtails.\nThat said, it’s not uncommon for animals whohavebeen microchipped but are not registered with one of the national microchip registries to go missing. So before the weekend rolls around, double check that your pet is microchipped, registered, and that your contact info (address and phone number) is current. And remember, a microchip is not a GPS device, likeWhistle offers. Microchipping only works if someone finds your lost pet and takes them to a vet or shelter to be scanned.\nAvert anxiety-induced behaviors.\nPets often try to relieve anxiety by chewing, so make sure confined pets do not have access to anything that they could choke or otherwise injure themselves on. Crating can curb that to a certain degree, but dogs should never be crated for more than four hours, and you should still keep a watchful eye on dogs with destructive tendencies.\nI have seen injuries as mild as broken toenails from trying to “dig out” from their crates to more extreme cases of mouth trauma and fractured teeth from biting the bars to escape. So, don’t try crating a dog for the first time on Memorial Day —  it will only add to their distress. Instead, distract your dog with aninteractive puzzle toyorfrozen Kong.\nHow to cope with dog anxiety—from training to medication.\nBeware of barbecue dangers.\nNo matter how well they work those pleading puppy-dog eyes, do not feed your dog scraps from the grill (and keep garbage bags out of reach afterwards). In addition to toxic foods, Memorial Day menu favorites, like chicken bones and corn cobs, are choking hazards. Even other seemingly innocuous snacks can lead topancreatitis,gastroenteritis, and intestinal obstructions that may require emergency surgery. And please do not give your dog beer — hops can cause hyperthermia,vomiting, abnormal clotting, coma, and even death.\nPrioritize pool safety.\nNo matter how proficient your dog’s doggie paddle is, it’s safest to avoid swimming this weekend. Every body of waterhas its unique risks, fromblue-green algae in lakesto strong currents in the ocean. But there are also hidden hazards in your own backyard pool such as water intoxication, akadry drowning. If your pup wants to take a dip to cool off and you’re able to keep an eye on them, consider alife jacket or other flotation devices for dogsfor added peace of mind. While chlorinated pool water is relatively safe to swallow in small amounts, chlorine tablets in their concentrated form are poisonous.\nStay cool and avoid heatstroke.\nWith temps on the rise and summer around the corner,heatstroke is a very real riskfor dogs. Make sure yours has access to shade and cold water, don’t leave them outside for an extended period of time, and watch out for symptoms of heatstroke, including excessive panting or drooling, a bright red or purple tongue, or increased heart rate.Brachycephalic dogs, such as Bulldogs and Pugs, are especially at risk because their short snouts make panting (a dog’s natural cooling mechanism) extra challenging. They often exhibit additional signs of overheating like wobbling or vomiting.\nIf any of these symptoms appear, move them to an air-conditioned environment and cover them with a wet towel ASAP. If they don’t cool down and stop panting, take them to an ER vet as heatstroke (again, particularly in certain breeds) can be fatal.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nHold the bug spray.\nAvoid spraying your pet with insect repellant, and only use sunscreen that is intended for animal use; human products can be toxic to them. Exposure to bug spray that contains DEET can lead to neurological problems. Ingestion of sunscreen products can result in drooling, vomiting,diarrhea, excessive thirst, and lethargy. Citronella candles, insect coils, and oil-based insect repellents can also cause stomach irritation and possibly central nervous system depression. So whatcanyou use to ward off mosquitos? Look for pet-safe, all-natural mosquito repellants like thosemade by Wondercide.\nKeep matches and lighter fluid out of reach.\nThis should be obvious, but you’d be surprised! Lighter fluid can be irritating to the skin. If ingested, it can produce irritation of the stomach and intestines, and it can cause aspiration pneumonia if it is inhaled. And certain types of matches contain chlorates that can damage blood cells and result in difficulty breathing or kidney disease in severe cases. So, after firing up the grill, put everything away.\nConsider calming aids to help them chill.\nSome pets respond well tosituational sedatives as needed, such as Acepromazine. If you already know your pet gets anxious in these situations, make an appointment with your veterinarian ahead of time to have your pet examined and a sedative dispensed (or, if your pet has had a vet visit in the past year and is otherwise healthy, they will often go ahead and dispense this medication for you).\nThis holiday should be for fireworks and grill-outs—not trips to the ER.\nThere are also herbal over-the-counter remedies for pets afraid of fireworks such asFeliway (cats)andTrazodone (dogs), which can offer homeopathic relaxing effects to your pets.Thundershirts can also be very helpfulfor reducing anxiety caused by the noise of fireworks.",

They will sell their souls to protect their pups from any noise that sends them running underneath the bed, but at the same time, some have no clue that many more common household sounds can be upsetting to their dogs as well.\nModern life is noisy, whether the microwave is humming and beeping, the smoke alarm low battery alert is chirping, or the vacuum has come alive. Half the time when I make pancakes, I accidentally test our smoke alarm, and let’s just say the dogs in my home are not fans.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nMost sound-related research on dogs focuses on infrequent but (from the dog’s point of view) catastrophic sounds, like gunshots and fireworks. Many everyday sounds that also upset dogs are largely ignored in studies, despite their negative effects on our best friends’ emotional state.\nHow to keep your dog mentally and physically safe this New Year.\nSo, what sounds actually scare dogs?\nSudden loud noises are one of the most common causes offearful behaviorin our dogs, but not enough is known about dogs’ reactions to the range of sounds that frighten them. Fear of sounds can cause anxiety in dogs, and living with either fear or anxiety (or both) can lead to a decreased quality of life and serious welfare concerns.\nIn a2021 study, researchers discoveredhigh frequency beeping and low frequency continuous sounds such as alarm clocks, plumbing, smoke detectors, cell phone noises, washing machines, dishwashers, vacuum cleaners, and fans canstress dogs out.\nThey also found that many pet parents underestimate their dogs’ negative emotional responses to such sounds, and often get a chuckle out of their dogs’ reactions.\nWhat do dogs do when they hear loud noises? Bark, obviously.\nIn this study, researchers surveyed 386 dog parents to learn how their dogs react to common household sounds. The purpose was to find out if dogs react to such sounds with fear, stress, and anxiety. Two-thirds of the people reported that their dogs were not fearful, and 70 percent of them had never sought help for a behavioral problem. However, when asked specifically about whether their dogs wereafraid of loud sounds(fireworks, thunder, gunshots), half said “yes” and half said “no.”\nIt will come as no surprise to anyone that the most common response to a loud sound was barking, which half of the dog parents reported. (That’s why the “mute” button on Zoom is such a Godsend!) Nearly one-third of people in the survey said their dogs retreated when they heard something. Behaviors associated with more serious stress in dogs, such as trembling, salivating, lip licking, panting, and howling were less common but still prevalent.\nResearch finds why dogs may suddenly become super sensitive to sounds.\nLow-frequency sounds cause dogs to jump on you, apparently.\nIn addition to analyzing dog behavior through surveys, the scientists also examined the behavior of dogs and people in videos and compilations posted online that featured dogs hearing common household sounds. The goal of this part of the study was to figure out how often dogs react to everyday household sounds, what those reactions are, and how people interpret their dogs’ responses.\nResearchers searched for such videos on YouTube, using search terms such as “fear,” “afraid,” “fire alarm”, “beeping”, “smoke detector,” and “vacuum.” They classified sounds as high-frequency intermittent (translation: beeping or chirping sounds, such as an oven timer or a low-battery warning from a smoke detector) or low-frequency-constant (translation: humming sounds like a microwave or a robot vacuum). The majority of pups in the study trembled when they heard a high-frequency-intermittent sound. But they retreated, lunging and jumping on their parents when the sound was a low-frequency continuous one. The videos also show that high-pitched repeated sounds caused more distress than low frequency continuous ones.\nIt's also worth taking note of how the pet parents reacted in these videos. In half of them, the pet parents acted like spectators — they did not comment, console, or react to their dog's behavior in any way. Perhaps this is because people were purposely trying to get video of the dog’s behavior to share online. The next most common reaction from these folks was amusement (45 percent of videos), followed by an attempt to analyze the behavior by discussing what was going on and why (26 percent).\nHow to cope with dog anxiety—from training to medication.\nStudying video isn’t the best way to get results, but this is compelling evidence.\nStudying videos online doesn’t meet normal standards for scientific rigor in terms of random sampling (the authors make this point — nobody’s trying to pull a fast one here). Plus, people don’t typically share the subtle or the barely noticeable dog responses — that usually doesn’t make the most engaging content — so most of the videos show extreme responses.\nBut the scientists make a compelling case that behaviors indicating fearfulness and anxiety are frequently seen in response to ordinary household noises, not just thunder and fireworks. Another big takeaway: The pet parents in the survey underestimated their dogs’ negative emotional responses to upsetting sounds. Unfortunately, some were also amused by their dogs’ fearful reactions.\nMy suggestion: Let’s pay more attention to our dogs’body languageso it doesn’t take a study to tell us that they hate the sound of the vacuum. And I'm for more compassion when it comes to these very real fears. They don’t laugh at you when their sudden barks make you jump, right? (Well, not that you know of).",

Another reason a dog may lick is to show affection or grooming behavior, similar to how they show affection to the mother dog.\nSometimes, when a dog licks, it can be an appeasement or nervous behavior. Have you evergiven your dog a big hug, and they seemed hesitant and licked you, looking at you out of the corner of their eyes? (This is, of course called“side-eye”: When your dog looks at you and their pupils move to the side of their eye causing you to see the whites of their eyes, sometimes called whale eye.) Your dog is telling you that they accept that affection, because they trust you but do not truly enjoy what you are doing to them, they are telling you they are uncomfortable.\nLicking can also be a sign of affection. Who doesn’t love returning home for the day and your dog greets you at the top of the stairs wiggling their entire body, then they plant a lick or two on your face? It is all fun and games until you remember where you saw them putting their tongue earlier that day. Then you may think twice about letting them lick you…\nBoundaries, folks. Boundaries.\nShould I let my dog lick me on the mouth?\nThe decision to let your dog kiss you on the mouth ultimately comes down to personal preference and risk tolerance. For most healthy individuals, the risk of contracting an illness from a dog’s saliva is relatively low. However, if you fall into the more susceptible categories or have concerns about potential bacterial transmission, it’s advisable to err on the side of caution.\nPet parents should consider factors such as their dog’s diet, overall health and an individual’s susceptibility to infections. It’s crucial to strike a balance between fostering a strong bond with your dog and ensuring responsible pet parenting. If you choose to allow your dog to lick your face, establishing boundaries and practicing good hygiene can mitigate potential risks.\nHere are some considerations to help you make an informed decision:\nHealth status: If you or someone in your household has a compromised immune system, it’s best to limit direct contact with your dog’s saliva, especially around the mouth.\nHealth status: If you or someone in your household has a compromised immune system, it’s best to limit direct contact with your dog’s saliva, especially around the mouth.\nDietary habits: Dogs on a raw diet may carry additional bacteria, so be mindful of their diet and take appropriate precautions.\nDietary habits: Dogs on a raw diet may carry additional bacteria, so be mindful of their diet and take appropriate precautions.\nPersonal comfort: If the idea of your dog’s kisses on your mouth doesn’t sit well with you, there’s no harm in setting boundaries.

You may have also seendogs eat their own poop, other animal poop, old rotten food, dead carcasses, and more. Even though a dog’s mouth contains certain antibacterial enzymes that can help heal wounds it does not mean that their mouths’ are clean.\nThere is always a chance of contracting a pathogen from your dog’s saliva. Many pathogens your dog may have can not be transmitted from pup to human, but some can be passed on to you.\nIf a dog is eating a raw diet, there is a greater risk of you contracting a sickness. If your dog eats raw meat, you could contract Salmonella orE. coli. When preparing raw meals for your dog, it is always good to take extra precautions when preparing their meals. Be sure to clean the area where you prepared the food, as well as clean their bowls after each use and the area where they eat their meals. It may also be best to wait a few hours before allowing your dog to lick you after they have consumed raw meat.\nAnother reason you should not allow your dog to lick you is when you have an open wound. Allowing your dog to lick your open wound can make you sick or in extreme cases septic.  The bacteriaCapnocytophagacan live inside your dog’s mouth. This bacteria does not make your pet ill but can make you sick. Most people who have come in contact withCapnocytophagawill not get sick, yet there is a chance of getting sick from this bacteria if you have a compromised immune system.\nIf you have a compromised immune system, it is best to proceed with caution when allowing a dog to lick your face, or anywhere on your body for that matter. If a dog has licked you, and it was unavoidable (they are just so darn cute) it is always good to wash the area a dog has come in contact with, especially if you are at a greater risk of illness.\nThen, there’s the issue of dog allergies. Not only can people beallergic to pet dander, but some people are allergic to dog saliva. If you are allergic, allowing a dog to lick you may cause an allergic reaction. You may get a rash, swelling, or become itchy. This happens because certain proteins from dog saliva may cause your immune system to react and attack those proteins as if it were a virus.\nWhile keeping your dog or cat at home where they belong.\nWhat should I do if my dog licks me on the mouth?\nIf your dog surprises you with an unexpected kiss on the mouth, here are some practical guidelines to help minimize potential risks to you.\nWash your face: After any dog-human interaction involving licking, wash your face thoroughly with mild soap (or face wash) and water to reduce the likelihood of transferring any bacteria.\nWash your face: After any dog-human interaction involving licking, wash your face thoroughly with mild soap (or face wash) and water to reduce the likelihood of transferring any bacteria.\nMonitor for symptoms: Keep an eye out for any unusual symptoms, especially if you or someone in your household is more susceptible to infections.\nMonitor for symptoms: Keep an eye out for any unusual symptoms, especially if you or someone in your household is more susceptible to infections.\nEducate yourself: Stay informed about the potential risks associated with dog saliva, especially if your dog is on a raw diet.\nEducate yourself: Stay informed about the potential risks associated with dog saliva, especially if your dog is on a raw diet.\nSet boundaries: Establish clear boundaries with your pup to control licking behaviors. Consistent training can help reinforce these boundaries and create a healthy balance between affection and hygiene.\nSet boundaries: Establish clear boundaries with your pup to control licking behaviors. Consistent training can help reinforce these boundaries and create a healthy balance between affection and hygiene.\nIf they’re following you around like your shadow, there’s a reason for that.\nHow to train my dog to stop licking me\nIt is always best touse positive reinforcementwhen training a behavior. Using positive reinforcement when training your dog creates apositive association with the behavioryou are working on. When your dog has been reinforced positively, they are more likely to choose to do the behavior you are asking of them. When training your dog not to lick, it is important to be as neutral as possible, rather than getting angry or annoyed.\nAny reinforcement — even negative reinforcement — may cause your dog to continue the unwanted behavior of licking. Yelling “no” and telling someone to stop means they should stop the behavior. Dogs do not speak our language, and if they have not been taught the word stop or no, they may think you are pulling away and saying “no” as a game. They may begin to act more silly and playful, because they think you are riling them up. So, rather than engaging with a dog when they lick you, turn away from them.\nWhen turning away or ignoring them, you want to be neutral; this will help your dog stay positive and better understand what you are asking them to do. When turning away, go slowly, do not make any noises, and avoid eye contact. When a dog looks away from another dog it is signaling to the other dog they need a break or do not like what is happening. So, by avoiding eye contact, you are telling your dog you did not like that.\nBe sure to be consistent, it is very confusing to your dog if you allow them to lick you one day but not another. If you continue to look away or ignore your dog when they lick you, the behavior will decrease over time. If turning away from them does not work, you may have to move away or leave the room completely, when doing so remember to be as neutral as possible. Your goal is not to upset your dog, your goal is to teach your dog to understand your message: When you lick me, I leave.\nThe age-old debate of whether to let your dog kiss you on the mouth boils down to a combination of personal preference, health considerations and risk tolerance. While your dog’s affectionate kisses are heartwarming, being aware of potential health risks allows you to make informed choices that prioritize both your wellbeing and the bond you share with them.\nReferences:\nSalivary Proteomics of Healthy Dogs: An In-Depth Catalog\nSalivary Proteomics of Healthy Dogs: An In-Depth Catalog\nLick of Death: Capnocytophaga Canimorsus Is an Important Cause of Sepsis in the Elderly\nLick of Death: Capnocytophaga Canimorsus Is an Important Cause of Sepsis in the Elderly\nComparative Proteomic Study of Dog and Human Saliva\nComparative Proteomic Study of Dog and Human Saliva\nCapnocytophaga\nCapnocytophaga\nCan You Be Allergic to Dog Saliva?\nCan You Be Allergic to Dog Saliva?",

  "page_content": "My dog Ava can be a ball of nervous energy. Just like her mother. It’s a real “who rescued who” situation when it comes to soothing our respective anxieties. But, if it’s any consolation to fellow fretters, we are far from alone.\nNearlyone in five U.S. householdsadopted a dog or cat during the pandemic, and understandably so. Pets provide companionship, a way toease stress, a reason to put on pants and go outside. Research consistently shows thatpets can improve our mental health, and, with a25 percent global increase in depression and anxietyduring the first year of the pandemic, we’re still reeling from the impact COVID-19 has had on our collective mental health. Of course, as anyone with a dog will tell you, adopting a pet isn’t an emotional cure-all.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nTake, for example, all those people on TikTok whose pet’s anxiety is anequal match for their own. This can run the gamut from pets experiencing a new-found degree ofseparation anxietyas owners return to the office to pets who are on thesameanti-anxiety medicationas their owners. I’m convinced Ava has been conducting rigorous studies on how sad her ears must look in order for me to never leave her home alone. The results have been inconclusive as she continues to find even subtler ways to seem sad.\nSo, what’s a person to do when their emotional support dog needs emotional support of her own?\nIs every dog an emotional support dog?\nFirst, we need to differentiate between getting a dog for emotional support and a certified emotional support animal (ESA). Any pet can provide comfort, alleviate loneliness, and be cute in a way you are sure is medically beneficial. However,registering your dog as an ESAdoes require you, as the owner, to have a consultation with and a letter from a certified mental health professional. On the other hand, your potential ESA has fewer criteria to meet than a registered service animal or psychiatric service dog. ESAs don’t require the  training to perform specific tasks for people with disabilities like guiding an owner with sight loss or reminding an owner to take their medication.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nBecause there is no legal requirement for ESA training, navigating your pet’s individual behavior is crucial to actually experiencing emotional support. If your dog is experiencing high levels of anxiety, “they may not be able to serve their emotional support function at the current time until their anxiety is treated,” explains Dr. Valli Parthasarathy, PhD, DVM, DACVB.If this is the case, Dr. Parthasarathy, who is also the co-owner of and Veterinary Behavior Specialist atSynergy Veterinary Behaviorin Portland, Oregon, recommends consulting with your dog’s vet and seeking behavior training so they can meet your required needs as a certified ESA.\nIf you aren’t looking for ESA certification but are hoping your anxious dog provides some comfort and support, rest assured there are ways you can ease their anxieties and, in turn, your own.\nWhat does anxiety look like in dogs?\nDogs can “absolutely” experience anxiety, says Brett Currie, a canine public training and behavior manager at Wayside Waifs in Kansas City. In addition to more commonly-known separation anxiety,dogs can feel anxiouswhen they’re afraid, in high-stress situations, and as they age. Unfortunately, we can’t just ask our pets how they’re feeling. (And even if we could, that might still lead to acompletely different set of emotional issues.)\nDr. Parthasarathy reiterates that every dog is different, which means anxiety can look different from pet to pet. Common signs of anxiety to look out for include excessive panting, pacing, tense body posture, and piloerection (hair standing up along your pet’s back or shoulders).\nShe notes that some signs of anxiety are less obvious, like widened eyes, dilated pupils, and a lowered tail. But, just as it does among people, Dr. Parthasarathy says “the specific combination of signs will differ between [dogs] and may change depending on the situation.”\nWhile other dogs may be more confrontational, Ava is a hider. But she also hides when she pees in the house and finds a dead bug she wants to study (i.e., roll in). You know your pet best and, with time and attention, can learn to tell the difference between a nervous wag and an excited one.\nWhat do I do when I can tell my dog is anxious?\nWe know our dogs don’t live to satisfy our every whim, though sometimes it seems they think we live to serve theirs. (They’re right.) Constant pressure to perform can make anyone anxious, dogs included. Still, it’d be nice if our dogs would, you know, chill out every once in a while.\nIf you notice your dog seems more anxious than usual, “it's always a good idea to start with a visit to your vet to be sure there's nothing physically wrong that's causing stress or anxiety,” Currie recommends. “As long as their health checks out, it's important to try to identify what is causing their stress and anxiety and give them a break from it.”Even my attention-seeking Ava needs a break from being pet every once in a while. It’s rare, but it happens. If it’s possible, removing either the source of stress or your pet from the situation is the best first option, both experts say. Unfortunately, this may mean you need to give your pet some space even though your parental instinct makes you want tocarry them around in a BabyBjörn.\nHow to cope with dog anxiety—from training to medication.\nIf it isn’t possible to remove the source of stress (e.g., thunderstorms, fireworks, general existential dread), Currie suggests creating a quiet, comfortable space for your dog and providingenrichment toyslike frozen Kongs or LickiMats as helpful distractions. Dr. Parthasarathy adds that owners should also monitor how their dog’s behavior changes around other people and animals. “The more that people can learn to recognize anxiety, the sooner dogs can get help and often the better the outcomes are for treatment,” she says. For pets that experience anxiety frequently and more severely, Currie says to talk with your vet and a certified trainer about anti-anxiety medications or individualized coping skills for behavior modification.\nOK, but what ifmyanxiety is exacerbated by my dogs?\nBummer news: Studies suggest thatnervous pet owners tend to have nervous pets. Better news: Feeling anxious when your dog is experiencing anxiety is totally understandable, says Dr. Parthasarathy, adding that “the best thing to do is to try to stay calm.” That is often easier said than done, so Currie suggests finding relaxing activities you and your dog can do together. “Sometimes reading out loud to a pet, going for a walk in a quiet area, or even playing a game of fetch in the yard can help ease your pet’s anxiety, as well as your own.”\nAbove all, both Currie and Dr. Parthasarathy emphasize that it’s OK to ask for help. “It’s always okay to seek professional help if you or your pet are struggling,” Currie says. “There’s no shame in seeking help to make you and your pet more comfortable.”",

  "page_content": "As all dog parents know, dogs come inmanyspectacular shapes, sizes and breeds, but according to a new study they only have five distinct personality types. The study published inScientific Reportstook a new approach to predicting and categorizing dog personalities, using an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to search through 70,000 behavioral records of dogs to find common threads running through the breeds.\nThe research was conducted over two years by Dr. Mohammad Amirhosseini of theUniversity of East London, Professor James Serpell of the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Veterinary Medicine, and the U.S. canine technology start-up Dogvatar, who sponsored the study.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhat are the five personality types in dogs?\nThe researchers found that all dogs could be classified into five groups: excitable/hyper-attached, anxious/fearful, aloof/predatory, reactive/assertive, or calm/agreeable. To discover their personality traits, dogs in the database were scored on behaviors, such as how they responded when unfamiliar people visited their home or if they were jealous when their parent gave affection to another animal.\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nWhy is it important to understand your dog’s personality type?\nIn the U.S., nearly 50 percent of people who surrender dogs to animal rescue orgs cite behavioral problems as a contributory factor. The researchers hope that the study’s results could help foster stronger bonds between humans and their dogs, paving the way for more effective training programs and tailored pet-parent interaction.\nLead author of the study, Dr. Mohammad Amirhosseini, said that the research could assist with dog-human matchmaking, as well as suitability for becoming a working dog. “We believe that our findings could help dog training agencies more quickly and accurately assess which animals are likely to succeed long-term in careers, such as aiding law enforcement and assisting persons with disabilities. The results could also be used for helping shelters with proper placement, thus reducing the number of animals returned for not being a good fit with their adoptive families.”\nClinical animal behavioristEmily Birchsays that research into dogs’ personalities is not new; however, this new study could have a massive impact on understanding dog behavior.\n“As a behaviorist, I certainly see these personalities within consults, and the repercussions of this when dogs and owners are poorly matched. However, I always err on the side of caution when labeling individuals. There will be a wide scale within these personality types and an element of crossover. The data is also still relying primarily on pet owner reporting of behaviors, which can vary with environment and situation, and change over time, so this is something to be taken into account.”\nAdvancements in artificial intelligence are changing everything from the way we detect illnesses to how we keep our pets safe.\nPersonality type: excitable/hyper-attached\nThis personality type is characterized by relatively high levels of excitability, attachment/attention-seeking behavior,separation-related anxiety, and reduced fear compared with the other personality types.\nBirch says you’ll be able to spot an excitable/hyper-attached dog because they’re always busy and may have a little FOMO. “They get excited easily, take a long time to calm down, and are the life and soul of the party! They may be impulsive, thinking little about consequences before they act. They need to be with and around you and probably follow you on every toilet visit, in case they miss something exciting!”\nExcitable dogs need humans who can cope with their extra energy and neediness, and recognize that their dog won’t be happy being alone for extended periods.\nNumber 6 will probably surprise you.\nPersonality type: anxious/fearful\nAnxious/fearful dogs displayed relatively high fear of social (such as unfamiliar people and other dogs) and non-social events (new or unexpected situations). The anxious/fearful dog is cautious in disposition, thinking hard before doing things.\nBirch believes they could be anxious because of past trauma. “But their personality type might go some way to explain why some dogs can be attacked by other dogs and still be dog-friendly, or treated terribly by humans but still happy and confident around them; whilst other dogs can have the smallest of things happen, but take it really deeply and are highly traumatized by the event.”\nAnxious/fearful dogs are more likely to whine, jump up, or try to intervene when their parent strokes another animal, and they need patient parents willing to put in time to help them deal with fearful situations.\nPersonality type: aloof/predatory\nAloof/predatory dogs have lower levels of attachment/attention-seeking and higher levels of predatory behavior and aggression towards other dogs.\nThese dogs are notoriously hard to train, per Birch. “They will look at you when you call them, then trot off to carry on their own business. They’re happy in their own space and fiercely independent. They will happily go off hunting without a backwards glance and may even kill wildlife. They might give the illusion of being a bit dim but I assure you, they’re not.”\nParents of aloof/predatory pups must be consistent and find a way to motivate and reward a dog whose greatest joy is sniffing or chasing wildlife.\nThere’s a difference between being affectionate and being annoying.\nPersonality type: reactive/assertive\nDogs who are reactive/assertive have heightened aggressive behavior across multiple domains, including aggression towards household members.Reactive dogstend to become aggressive when scolded or shouted at by their parents, and fearful of sudden loud noises, such as a vacuum cleaner being switched on or an object being dropped.\n“These dogs are on the offensive and know what they like and do not like,” Birch says. “Their traits may have been bred into working dogs over generations – if you’re a shepherding breed, you need to be aware of predators and not be scared of seeing them off when protecting your livestock.”\nWith a reactive dog, work to identify the specific triggers that set your dog off. A trigger acts as a stimulus to make your dog react dramatically. After identifying triggers, try to avoid them while you work on a training plan, which should be based on positive reinforcement and patience.\nPersonality type: calm/agreeable\nAccording to the research, calmer dogs were less likely to chase birds or cats than their counterparts and were quicker to learn new tricks or tasks. “They’re easy to live with, go with the flow and make great pets. They may not set the world on fire with their working ability, but they are worth their weight in gold,” Birch says.\nDue to their peaceful nature, Birch rarely meets these dogs in her practice. Calm dogs tend to beideal family dogsbecause they’re great around young children. Or, if you’re getting older and want a dog who can match your pace, a calm canine could be precisely what you’re looking for.\nHow can this research be applied in the future?\nDr Amirhosseini says: “We are still working on analyzing the potential relationship between human personality traits and these dog personality types. Personality type and behaviors are closely intertwined, so a key future outcome is understanding effective training techniques for a dog’s personality type. In theory, in the future rescue organizations and shelters could use a tool to understand both a dog’s personality and how good a fit it is for the right owner.”",

  "page_content": "I was at a small housewarming party recently where a guest arrived late, looking harried. She explained that one of her dogs, Max, had recently passed away, and her second dog, Penny, was taking it pretty hard. Penny had always struggled with anxiety, but with consistent care and training had made tremendous progress over the past couple of years. Now, without Max around, she was reverting to her old ways.\nShe waseating less, didn’t play as much, wouldn’t engage with the other dogs at daycare, and was having accidents in the house. (Penny’s mom had to clean up one of these accidents before she left, which was why she was late.)\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nAccording to a paperpublished in the journalin 2022, Penny’s behavior is not unusual. The study looked at data collected from 426 adults with multiple pet dogs and found that surviving dogs who lost a canine companion showed “grief-related and emotional patterns.” The most common behaviors pet parents reported were attention-seeking (67 percent); playing less (57 percent); a decline in activity (46 percent);sleeping more(35 percent);increased fearfulness(35 percent); eating less (32 percent); and increased vocalization,like barkingand whining (30 percent).\nHow long do dogs grieve?\nOf those participants who noticed a negative behavior change in their surviving dog, about a third said it lasted between two and six months after the death of their companion, 29.4 percent said it lasted less than two months, and 24.9 percent said it lasted over six months.\nThe study also found that the amount of time the dogs had spent together had no effect on the surviving dog’s likelihood of exhibiting negative behavior. A much stronger predictor, they found, was the quality of the dogs’ relationship. Dogs were far more likely to play less and show disrupted feeding patterns if their relationship with the deceased pup had been described as “friendly,” rather than “agnostic” or “mutual tolerance.”\nEnd-of-life veterinary specialist Dr. Shea Cox on how to make the most difficult decision in your pet parenting journey.\nDogs and humans influence each other\nThese findings are significant, because even though most dog parents have spent hours observing and dissecting our dogs’ most minute behaviors, preferences, and quirks, there’s still a lot we don’t know about the inner lives of our furry companions. As Dr. Stefania Uccheddu, one of the authors of the study, tells us, the study was born out of a desire to shed light on a fundamental but still under-explored area of dog’s lives: their complex emotions, particularly grief.\n“In general, emotions are perhaps the most enigmatic sphere of animal life — the most difficult to explore,” Dr. Uccheddu explains. It’s this challenge, she says that makes them an especially compelling undertaking for scientists. She adds that one of the findings that surprised her the most was that a surviving dog was more likely to eat less if their pet parent was also displaying signs of grief. This could be the result of “emotional contagion” between the dog and human, or the result of a dog’s ability to pick up on the negative emotions of their pet parents.\n“Dogs have become extremely sensitive to human communicative gestures and facial expressions, especially their emotional expressions,” Dr. Uccheddu says. Indeed, the study found a positive correlation between an increased fear level in the surviving dog and the pet parent’s own level of suffering and anger. As two social species, Dr. Uccheddu explained, dogs’ and humans’ emotions are highly susceptible to the emotions of those around them.\nAre we just projecting?\nHow can we know whether the change in behavior we’re seeing is really grief or something else? Are we projecting our own human emotions onto our pets? “I think anyone who has lived with animals for long enough has seen them mourn the passing of a household member, whether it’s an animal or not,” says Robert Haussmann, a certified dog trainer, co-founder ofDogboy NYC, andKinship Collectivemember. “But is it mourning? Is it separation distress? Is it change in routine distress? Those are all important things to bring up.”\nEven though it’s the last thing you want to think about.\nAs Haussmann notes, it can be tempting for pet parents to anthropomorphize our pups. And we’re not completely unjustified in doing so. Modern dogs have been bred for centuries to be social and to read human emotions. “That’s why pet dogs are able to be pet dogs,” Haussmann says. “We’ve gone out of our way to make them social creatures, and they’re also highly emotional creatures.”\nSo, while we can’t say for sure that what a surviving dog is experiencing is definitely grief as we humans conceive of grief, we can’t dismiss the possibility that they’re feeling something similar to our loss either. “In my opinion, I do think dogs mourn their companions,” Haussmann says.\nDogs are pretty stoic, he notes, so they might not display their grief by moping around the house. They might behave like they did before but be more jumpy, bark more, orpull more on the leash. “Give the dog some time to adjust, and be proactive,” Haussmann says. If they get anxious or aggressive or their new behavior does seem like it requires training,reach out to a professionalwho can help put a plan together for the dog. “If that dog was mirroring their big brother or sister and now they’re gone, you might need you to be a better teacher.”\nAnd above all, Haussmann says, adjusting to the new normal just takes time. “I always point out to people: This is an animal without a language center. They’re not using inner dialogue. They’re not going to journal about it. It’s something that is very different from us, and we need to respect it.”",

  },
  "page_content": "Gone are the days of CBD being seen as America’s next top snake oil. Instead, it seems every few months more substantial evidence drops supporting at least a portion of its ostensibly endless favorable claims. This influx of research backs CBD as the sexy, new all-natural alternative treatment for a number of common ailments such as chronic pain, inflammation, and insomnia.\nAnd while CBD may not be the healthcare cure-all some purport it to be, it clearly offers a range of benefits for us and those we hold most dear. In fact, arecent studyfrom theWaltham Petcare Science Institutefinds that even a single dose of CBD can effectively reduce stress in dogs.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhat does CBD actually do for dogs?\nBefore we get into the study, a quick recap might be helpful for those of us who aren’t currently drinking the hemp tea. Cannabidiol, aka CBD, is an active ingredient of the cannabis plant. But! This is not your father’s marijuana — it contains no THC; in other words, it is non-psychoactive. Several brands and researchers have suggested that CBD does have calming properties, which explains its frequent use as a de-stressor for both humans and animals alike. The Waltham Petcare Science Institute, which is the science hub for Mars Petcare, set out to determine the legitimacy of these claims — at least on the dog front.\n“We know pet owners try various approaches — from training to medications and supplements — to help their dogs cope with stressful situations often with mixed results,” says Dr. Jennifer Welser, Chief Medical Officer of Mars Veterinary Health,in a statement. “We’re focused on scientific inquiry that generates knowledge that can inform pet professionals’ and pet owners’ decisions. So, this study is important because it gives us new evidence that CBD at the dose studied can be beneficial for dogs in specific circumstances.”\nWith a new line of CBD-infused bones and pack-shaped plush toys, pups can munch to mellow out.\nSo, can CBD help with your super anxious dog?\nIf you have a pup who’s a littleroad trip-resistant or literally claws the floorwhen you leave the house, CBD might be your solution. The study examined how CBD may alleviate stress from separation orcar rides— stating that these are two of the most common factors to upset a pup.  The study notes: “Pet dogs are likely to experience a variety of stress-inducing scenarios over their lifetime, often due the relationship they have with people. These are often unavoidable and are commonly related to events such as car travel and separation from caregivers or conspecifics.”\nThe study goes on to note that the pandemic has caused separation anxiety in dogs to increase — and will continue to do so. Additionally, The Waltham Petcare Science Institute reports that one in four dogs suffer from travel-related issues and frequently display behaviors including trembling, panting,shaking, hyper-salivating,self-licking,barking, andwhining. Of course, no one wants to see their pup upset, but these symptoms can also be dangerous. According to the study, “Notwithstanding the dog’s emotional and physical discomfort, these behaviors could distract the driver, possibly endangering the pet, caregiver, and other road users.”\nWellness treatments like acupuncture, Reiki, and sound baths are helping pets heal and bond with their parents.\nHow do we know CBD actually helps anxious dogs?\nTo evaluate whether the hemp derivative may operate as a possible remedy, researchers randomly assigned 40 dogs into two groups for a six-month testing period. Half of the participating dogs were placed into the CBD group, while the other 20 operated as a placebo group. Those in the CBD group were regularly given a single dose of 4 milligram broad-spectrum CBD two hours prior to being introduced to stressful events, like vehicle-bound travel or being left alone. The placebo group entered these situations as they would normally.\nOK, but is untreated anxiety actually a problem for dogs?\nThe findings, which were published inFrontier in Veterinary Sciencelast week, revealed that the dogs who were given CBD experienced significantly lower cortisol levels, whined less, and overall appeared more relaxed compared to those in the placebo group. The dogs who did not receive CBD were rated as being more stressed, tense, and uncomfortable during these events, too.\nAnyone who has attended a high school driver’s ed class can attest to the importance of safe driving, a feat not easily accomplished with an anxious canine in the passenger seat. And all pup parents know there are few things more heartbreaking than the guilt of leaving your upset dog at home. Unfortunately, those aren’t the only concerns. Researchers warn that if not addressed, these occurrences of anxiety can compound and begin to negatively affect a dog’s health.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\n“Although mild stress is not considered harmful, welfare is compromised if an animal experiences high levels of acute stress or is exposed to prolonged stressors which can lead to chronic physical and emotional health issues,” the study states.\nUltimately, like with any emerging treatment, more research is still needed. But the Waltham Petcare Science Institute’s study adds more fuel to the pro-CBD fire and indicates that, at a minimum, the hemp derivative can be an effective tool in suppressing stress in anxiety-ridden pups.\nIn turn, a chilled-out pet can calm down their parents.  “Due to the ever-changing human-pet relationship, there is an increasing requirement for dogs to fit into human lifestyles which can cause stress and anxiety to both people and their pets,” the study adds. In short, this could be good foreveryone.\nDisclaimer alert: This article is here to share information. But, much like pineapple on pizza, the topic may be controversial. Meaning, not all vets or pet professionals agree. Because every pet is a unique weirdo with specific needs. So, don’t take this as fact or medical advice. Talk things over with your vet when making decisions, and use your best judgment (about both your pet’s health and pizza toppings).",

  "page_content": "You’re sitting on the couch, cuddling with your dog, when you notice they just start going to town on their paws, chewing like there’s a lost treat in there or something. Next time, you notice it when you’re both trying to settle in for bed. The paw-chomping continues —whatcould be causing it?\nDogs chew their paws for various reasons, including cleaning, boredom, anxiety, allergies, injuries, parasites, and foreign objects. Excessive paw chewing can lead to irritation, infection, and behavioral problems. If your dog is chewing their paws excessively, it’s important to identify the underlying cause and seek veterinary attention if necessary.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nHere’s what works (and what doesn’t).\nCommon reasons why dogs chew their paws\nPododermatitis is inflammation of the paw’s skin, including the nail beds, paw pads, and space between the toes. It can affect one or more feet and is a common reason for dogs to lick their paws. Pododermatitis is a set of symptoms rather than a specific diagnosis, so action is often needed to determine the cause of the inflammation. Not all causes of paw chewing in dogs require immediate attention, but don’t ignore persistent biting and licking of the paws.\nReasons for dogs to chew their paws include:\nWhile dogs don’t indulge in hour-longtongue baths like cats, they still use licking as a means to keep themselves clean. Licking can be used to remove outdoor debris from their paws.\nAnxiety and boredom in dogs can manifest in a few ways, including panting, pacing, destructive behavior, and excessive grooming. While some dogs may pacify themselves by licking their paws, this repetitive action can result in hair loss and skin irritation.\nDogs can be allergic to fleas, food, or elements of their environment. No matter the cause, allergic dogs often have itchy feet. Constant licking and chewing can be an early indicator to dog parents that their pup has allergies.\nBacterial and fungal infections are common causes for dogs to lick their paws. Yeast and bacteria often thrive in damp environments, including damp doggie feet. Continuous chewing can create small breaks in the skin, providing entry points for infection. Infection also causes irritation that encourages licking and chewing, creating a cycle where additional dampness encourages more bacteria and yeast to grow.\nDog paws commonly sustain trauma from cuts, broken toenails, hot surfaces, or contact with irritants like cleaning products or rock salt. Penetrating injuries can result in irritating foreign bodies under the skin (think of an annoying splinter in your finger). Pups often lick painful areas as a way to self-soothe.\nHookworm larvaecan use a dog’s feet as a point of entry, burrowing under the skin and entering the lymphatic system. Skin parasites, such as fleas, ticks, and mites can also cause itchiness and inflammation that will make some dogs bite their paws constantly.\nHere are the types of worms your pup could get, how you know they have them in the first place, and how to get rid of them for good.\nHow can I encourage my dog to stop chewing their paw?\nDog parents just want their pups to be happy and healthy, but non-stop gnawing and smacking can be pretty annoying, especially during the night. When excessively biting paws, dogs should be evaluated by a veterinarian to rule out health issues first.\nMake sure it isn’t amedical issue: Consult with your veterinarian to rule out trauma, infections, or parasitic infestations that can be remedied with medical treatment.\nMake sure it isn’t amedical issue: Consult with your veterinarian to rule out trauma, infections, or parasitic infestations that can be remedied with medical treatment.\nIdentify triggers: Dogs may be allergic to certain proteins in their food.

Your veterinarian will start with a medical history and a thorough physical exam to look for signs of trauma, infection, or infestation. They may recommend diagnostic testing, such as skin scraping or impression smears, to rule out bacteria, yeast, or skin mites. If there is concern for trauma to the bone, radiographs (X-rays) may be warranted. Your vet may also prescribe medications for infections and infestations. Traumatic injuries may require procedures like draining an abscess, repairing a wound, or placing a bandage.\nIf there is concern for a chronic issue, such as allergies or behavioral problems, then treatment can be less straightforward. Food trials and elimination diets may be recommended for suspected allergies. Behavior modification may include a combination of environmental change, training, and medication.\nWoof’s innovative fillable design will help dogs de-stress and their parents save money.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nBoredom and anxiety can be reasons that dogs constantly lick and chew their paws. To try to curb this behavior, dog parents can increase mental stimulation with toys and ensure their dog is getting adequate exercise.\nCone collars can be used to break the cycle of constant licking and give injured or infected dog paws an opportunity to stay dry and heal. While physical barriers are helpful, they’re not considered a permanent solution.\nOccasionally, licking or chewing the paws is a normal part of dog grooming and behavior. When the chewing and licking becomes compulsive or causes trauma, consult a vet.\nReferences:\nCanine Pododermatitis",

  "page_content": "If you could see my search history, you’d probably be worried. About me, not my dog. In the past couple days alone, I have asked the internet whether my dog’seye gunk is a normal color, if she will be emotionally scarred from having topoop in the snow, and whether she thinks I’m her mom or her wife. (Yes, no, and both.)\nIf my dog were a human child — which, in many ways, she is — I’d be teetering on the edge of helicopter parenting. This type of parent is typically characterized by being overly attentive, excessively cautious, Googling questions like “best everyday body armor for kids,” and general hovering. Understandably, this level of parental hyper-vigilance comes with a stigma.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhat’s the link between helicopter parenting and mental health?\nLast year, a team of Norwegian researchers reviewed 38 different studies focusedon helicopter parentingand symptoms of anxiety and depression. They found that a majority of these studies suggested a relationship between helicopter parenting and anxiety/depression, though they noted the evidence is “insufficient” and needs to be investigated further.\nIn 2018, astudy from the American Psychological Associationfound that toddlers who experienced“over-controlling” parentingat age two had poorer behavioral and emotional regulation at age five. Alternatively, children who exhibited stronger emotional and behavioral regulation at age five were less likely to have social or emotional issues at age ten. The same year, theNew York Timespublished an article on parentshelping versus “helicoptering”their children, asking questions like, “Are we abetting dependency?” and “Can we allow our child to be uneasy?”\nWe asked both animal behaviorists and human psychologists howyoucan deal with leaving your dog home alone.\nOften, it starts from a place of love. We want the ones we care about to be safe, healthy, and happy — pets included. In turn, it’s all too easy to let legitimate concerns grow to full-blown panic. If this sounds familiar as a fellow pet parent, fear not. (Er, fearless.) Here’s what you need to know about helicopter parenting your dog.\nWhat isa helicopter pet parent and am I one?\nThere is no definitive test to determine whether you’re a helicopter parent (for children, dogs, or otherwise). This is great news if you’d prefer to panic in peace but not so helpful if you’re trying to ease your own anxieties. Fortunately, I spoke to a couple of experts who offered insight into what helicopter parenting could look like for pet parents.\n“In my experience, helicopter dog parenting often manifests as jumping to the worst possible conclusion about your pet,” Margaret, an animal shelter educator in the Kansas City, Missouri, area, tells me. She used the examples of rushing to the vet because you’re worried your dog yawns too much or assuming that if your dog growls at one (one) stranger, you’ll never be allowed to take them in public again.\nMargaret continues: “As a self-confessed helicopter dog parent myself, I am constantly going over my girls with a (sometimes literal) fine-toothed comb in order to look for new bumps and bruises.” Even the professionals do it!\nWhich comes first: a nervous person or a nervous pup?\nRobert Haussmann, a certified professional dog trainer, behavior consultant, and Kinship Collective member, says he often sees helicopter pet parenting manifest as over policing a dog’s innate instincts.\n“Many clients over-police their dog’sability to sniff and explorebecause they are so concerned about what the dog may eat,” he says, noting that this kind of concern is understandable after you’ve “pulled the fourth mystery tissueout of your dog’s mouth.” But, he adds: “Sniffing and exploring is crucial to a puppies development and an adult dog’s quality of life.”\nThere are studies that suggest anxious pet parentstend to have anxious dogs. But like the studies with human helicopter parents, the findings aren’t conclusive, nor are they causational. Like most things in life, the key is striking a balance between your own caution and your dog’s curiosity.\n“I think it’s great when people are hyper aware of their dog's well being,” Haussman says, noting that dog’s lives are enriched by parents who research diet, engage in exercise, encourage mental stimulation, and the like. “It can go off the rails however when people micromanage their dogs ability to explore or socialize,” he continues, adding that it’s important to let dogs “navigate the rich tapestry of canine social communication.”\nAs someone who works in an animal shelter, Margaret sees plenty of positives in “helicopter” pet parenting. “I would much, much rather someone err on the side of over-attentiveness rather than the side of indifference or cruelty,” she says, noting that being hypervigilant could help you catch early signs of illness or keep your pet from, say,eating something they shouldn’t. “You may get the occasional eye roll from your mother whowanted human grandchildren,” she continues. “But so be it.”\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nIf you’re concerned about helicopter-parenting your pet, Haussman recommends working with a professional trainer. “New dog owners especially benefit from learning what is normal behavior and when to be concerned,” he says.\nMargaret offers some basic questions pet parents can ask themselves as a gut check: Does your dog have consistent access to good food and clean water? Does your dog have a comfortable place to rest? Does your dog have the space and opportunity to do the things dogs do (run, play, etc.)? Is your dog safe? Does your dog have regular access to medical care? “If the answer to all of the above is ‘yes,’” she says. “Then, your dog is likely feeling happy, healthy, and loved!” And if you have concerns, you can always talk to your vet.\nBoth experts recommend following your dog’s lead. “Remember that dogs like doing dog stuff,” Haussman says. “Micromanaging, being overly protective or strict can add stress for both you and your dog.”\nAbove all, what’s most important is having a well-loved pet. For some, that may mean letting your dog explore a little more or, yes, double-checking that blueberries are safe for dogs to eat.

  "page_content": "We know that premature gray hair in people is a result of a variety of influences, and it’s fair to point accusing fingers at an obvious one: stress. Before-and-after pictures of U.S. presidents show an astounding increase in gray hair in eight — or even four — years. Many parents swear their kids are making them go gray.\nMy husband has solid evidence that the stress of parenting is the cause of gray hairs. His identical twin brother, who became a parent a few years before my husband did, started going gray soon after his kids were born. My husband also went gray soon after our kids were born. Yeah, that can’t be a coincidence. A 2016study on premature graying in dogssuggests that stress is a factor in our canine best friends, too.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nPro tips for boosting the confidence of a scaredy-cat dog.\nThe study on premature graying and stress in dogs\nThe study was of 400 dogs in the age range of one to four years who were recruited with flyers at veterinary clinics, dog shows, and dog parks. Each dog was photographed from the front and from the side so that researchers could assess the degree of graying on the pups’ muzzles.\nThey were scored as follows: Zero equals no gray; one equals frontal gray; two equals half gray; and three equals full gray. Additionally, their parents filled out a 42-question survey. From there, researchers collected data on anxious behaviors, impulsive behaviors, fears, size, age, sex, number of dogs and cats in the household, time spent unsupervised outdoors, whether they were spayed or neutered, medical issues, and participation in organized sports or activities.\nResearchers found an association between graying on the muzzle andanxious behaviors,impulse behaviors, and fear ofloud noises,unfamiliar people, and unfamiliar dogs. The extent of grayness was positively correlated with age, and female dogs were more gray than male dogs. There was no link found with size,being spayed or neutered, medical problems (which were rare in the sample),reactions to thunderstorms, fear of unfamiliar places, number ofdogs or cats in the household, time spent outside unsupervised, or being involved in organized activities.\nDogs were only included in the study if it was possible to determine how gray their muzzles were. (White dogs and those with merle coloring didn’t make the cut, causing 43 dogs to be excluded from the study.) The people who evaluated the photographs were not the same people who had any knowledge of the questionnaires, which prevents accidental bias in the assessment of the degree of graying. The survey was designed so that pet parents were unaware of the purpose of the study; they were simply told it was about dog lifestyle.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nHow this info helps our stressed pups\nThis research adds to our understanding of premature graying in dogs, and what’s most exciting about that is the possibilities it opens for helping dogs. Being anxious or fearful and struggling with impulse control are hard on dogs, and any help dogs receive for these issues can be beneficial.\nIf behaviorists, veterinarians, trainers, and other dog professionals know that a gray muzzle in a young dog may indicate that the dog suffers from these issues, perhaps they will more thoroughly assess them or refer them to other people for evaluation. It’s just another way that people can potentially make life better and easier for many dogs.\nIt’s important that practitioners avoid jumping to the conclusion that a prematurely graying dog is necessarily stressed, fearful, or has issues with impulsivity. Although these issues should be explored, they may not explain the gray hair because other factors may be at play.\nThis isn’t exactly likeThe Wizard of Oz’s “Horse of a Different Color” scenario, but it’s notnotthat.\nOther reasons dogs go gray\nOne genetic cause of going gray is the not-so-creatively named “graying gene.” The specifics of this gene have not been well-studied, but we do know that dogs expressing this gene have fur that gradually fades to gray. Dog fur color comes fromtwo different types of melanin: eumelanin, which gives fur black or brown coloring, and phaeomelanin, which gives fur shades of red or yellow coloring.\nThe graying gene primarily affects eumelanin with only limited effects on phaeomelanin. Dogs who are gray because of the graying gene are born with full coloration, but gradually fade. New hairs are fully colored, but the color fades as it grows out. The hair tends to be darkest at the base but lighter towards the tips.\nBecause the fading is progressive, these gray dogs tend to be dogs with long, continuously growing fur, such as wiry and curly coated dogs. Short-haired dogs, even if they have this graying gene, usually shed hairs before they have an opportunity to fade to gray. Black masks on dogs in which at least the muzzle — and sometimes the tips of the ears, the whole ears and the face are also dark — are not affected by the gradual graying gene even though the coloration comes from eumelanin.\nSo, dogs with the graying gene may be gray on most of their body but dark on the face, which is the opposite of the dogs who are going gray because of stress. This gradual-graying gene is more common in some breeds than others. Breeds known for this gradual graying include Poodles, Bedlington Terriers, Dandie Dinmont Terriers, Irish Wolfhounds, Bearded Collies, and Havanese.\nAnd how you might safely give your pup immediate relief.\nOther health issues that are to blame\nDisease can cause premature graying of the fur. There is evidence that thyroid issues, liver disease, andkidney diseasemay all be associated with going gray early. Askin conditioncalled vitiligo can cause a loss of pigment in patches on the face and body, leading to light fur in areas where it used to be darker. It may be an autoimmune disorder, and it’s possible that it has a genetic basis. There are other case studies of dogs going gray or white because of autoimmune issues that cause the body to attack its own melanocytes — the cells that produce melanin.\nDogs going gray at an early age may have health issues and need to see a vet. They may also have behavioral issues and need a behaviorist’s help, or they may just be a dog with adorable spectacles before their time.\nReferences:\nEumelanin and Phaeomelanin Contents of Human Epidermis and Cultured Melanocytes",

Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat is clingy behavior in dogs?\nDogs are social animals, and they have evolved tight bonds with their human companions, so it’s totally normal for your dog to want your attention and affection. But a dog being clingy could be a sign of a deeper issue, such as anxiety, stress, or even an underlying health problem.\nIf they’re following you around like your shadow, there’s a reason for that.\nClingy behavior in so-called “Velcro dogs” (because they stick to their human parents) can manifest in a variety of ways. Your dog likely will be reluctant to leave your side and may even follow you from room to room. They may act uncertain or even anxious when you prepare to leave the house and could lean against you or need to touch you in some way whenever you’re near.\nWhat are the early signs of clingy behavior in dogs?\nKnowing the signs of a clingy dog can help you recognize this behavior and start addressing the issue ASAP. When you recognize your dog’s clingy behavior, you can get a clearer understanding of their needs and figure out how to make your dog less clingy. Look out for these signs:\nConstantly following you\nConstantly following you\nRestlessness or reluctance to settle down\nRestlessness or reluctance to settle down\nExcessing barking or whining\nExcessing barking or whining\nA frequent need for attention\nA frequent need for attention\nRefusal to eat or drink alone\nRefusal to eat or drink alone\nTrouble sleeping alone\nTrouble sleeping alone\nVery emotional at reunions with you\nVery emotional at reunions with you\nLack of interest in toys or playtime\nLack of interest in toys or playtime\nOften seeking physical contact with you\nOften seeking physical contact with you\nHesitant to explore on their own\nHesitant to explore on their own\nWhen you recognize signs of this behavior early on, you can consider investing in training and working on socialization to help your dog feel more comfortable and confident.\n“A variety of training focuses can reduce the anxiety and fear that commonly produce hyper-attachment,” Fulton says. “Properly socializing a young dog familiarizes them with many events that life will throw at them.”\nAnimal behaviorist Dr. Karen B. London on how to strengthen your pet-parent bond.\nWhat should I do if my dog is being clingy?\nLike any behavioral issue, addressing clinginess requires understanding, patience, and consistent positive reinforcement. Remember that the goal is to help your dog become more independent and confident, able to enjoy the world without you constantly at their side.\n“If a pet parent observes clingy behavior, I recommend reassuring and properly distracting their dog,” Fulton says. “It’s important to remember that we cannot reinforce, and therefore increase, a behavior that is motivated by an emotion. Putting your dog’s attention on something other than the anxiety-inducing event or stimulus can help them.”\nFollow these tips to take care of a clingy dog so you can help your pet feel more comfortable standing on their own four feet.\nThe best way to help your dog with their clinginess is to understandwhythey feel a need to stay close to you. Some dogs may just lack confidence and seek reassurance and protection by being near you, while others may develop clingy behavior as a result of past trauma or neglect.\n“Anxiety is often the leading cause for clingy behavior,” Fulton says. “I see and hear about this most frequently when a dog is in a new and unfamiliar situation or environment. Uncertainty contributes heavily to anxiety. The dog may be uncertain about how to behave, what is safe or dangerous, or what will happen next.”\nIt was a trick question. A study shows that the pandemic has made us all codependent.\nIf your dog acts panicked without you, their behavior may actually be caused by separation anxiety. Dogs who experience separation anxiety become distressed when separated from their human parents and may exhibit destructive behaviors.\nIf your dog is very clingy all of a sudden, a health issue may be the underlying cause. If your dog feels pain or discomfort, they may seek you out more often for extra attention. Pay attention to your dog’s behavior and if you notice any other sudden changes in behavior or symptoms of illness, consult your veterinarian to see if their clinginess is a result of a health problem.\nOften, a clingy dog just needs a little extra physical and mental stimulation. Exercise can help tire your dog out and reduce stress, so go for that daily walk or play a game of fetch. Consider investing in puzzles and other interactive toys to help your dog stimulate their mind and channel their energy in a healthy way.\nDogs thrive on consistency, so make sure you have a daily schedule for meals, playtime, and bedtime — and stick to it. This structure and predictability can make your dog feel more at ease, helping to reduce clingy behavior.\nIt’s likeWhat to Expect When You’re Expecting, except add“four little paws to run around your house”to the title.\nIf your dog becomes anxious when you leave the house, slowly desensitize them to alone time. Start with only leaving for a short time and gradually increase the duration. Make sure to reward your dog when they act calm. You can also consult with a professional dog trainer or behaviorist, who can provide you with a personalized plan to help accustom your dog to being alone.\nPositive reinforcement traininghelps your dog understand what behaviors you want to see from them. Consider enrolling in a dog training class or work on basic commands on your own. Always reward good behavior with praise and treats. Slowly expose your dog to new environments and experiences through controlledsocializationand reward them for maintaining calm.\n“If your dog hasn’t been gifted with a history of excellent socialization, you can gradually expose them to new situationsat their own pace,” Fulton emphasizes. “It’s important not to throw the learning swimmer (your dog) into the deep end of the pool. You can encourage your dog to enter new situations, but you must give them the option to disengage. Otherwise, you may associate even stronger negative emotions with the situation.”\nIf none of these tips work for you and you’re still wondering why your dog is a stage-five clinger, it’s time to reach out to a professional. Acertified dog traineror veterinary behaviorist can determine your dog’s needs and help guide you to address their clingy behavior.\nTrain your dog to stay calm when they’re on their own — instead of sad-singing“All By Myself”until you come home.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nIgnoring any unwanted behavior is not the most effective approach. Instead, reward your dog when they display independence or self-soothing behaviors.\nIf you find yourself googling, “Why is my dog acting weird and clingy?” there may be an obvious reason. Changes to your dog’s routine or environment, like a new home or new family member, can lead to stress and anxiety, which can manifest in clingy behavior. Make sure to offer your dog stability and reassurance during any times of change. If the behavior interferes with your dog’s well-being, consult your vet.\nProfessional training can help build your dog’s confidence, as well as provide mental stimulation. A certified trainer can build a program around your dog’s needs to help reduce clingy behaviors.\nClingy behavior can be a symptom ofseparation anxietyin dogs, but usually there are other signs as well, such as extreme distress when left alone, excessive barking or whining, and destructive behavior. Talk to your vet to determine if separation anxiety is the underlying cause of your dog’s clinginess.\nSeparation anxiety in dogsrequires the guidance of a professional to help reduce anxiety and modify the behavior. Consult a veterinary behaviorist to work with you and your dog and help manage your pet’s separation anxiety. And remember that improving the behavior will take time, so be patient.\n“Let go of your own mile markers and find accomplishments in the process that you can praise and reward,” Fulton says. “Both of you will have a better experience if you do this!”",

But a lucky few people can beta-test an appcalled Tably, which “reads” cats’ facial cues to assess how much pain they may or may not be in. More specifically, this tech, which leans on AI-crunched data, factors-in “ear position, orbital tightening, muzzle tension, whisker positions, and head position” to reach its verdict.\nIn another recent advancement, researchers studying kitties at a cat cafe in Los Angeles determined that cats, long assumed to be poker-faced, actually have276 facial expressions. (Toput that in context: Humans only have 44.) This underscores a wholefield of scienceassiduously devoted to using AI to decode which signifiers indicate your pet’s mood. “As this paper suggests, there is a much greater richness in cat expressions than we appreciate, and what AI is good at is classifying images,” Dr. Daniel Mills, a professor of veterinary behavioral medicine at the University of Lincoln, toldThe Guardian.\nYour dog can’t tell you if they don’t feel well, but the cutting-edge AI behind this health tracker can.\nAnother study, jointly led by a researcher out of University of Haifa in Israel and another out of the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover in Germany, sought to gauge which cats at a veterinary hospital were feeling pain.They foundthat a cat’s mouth — rather than their ears or eyes — is the most critical indicator when it comes to pain estimation. They’re currently working on an app to help vets and pet parents alike leverage their findings.\nBark translators are going to be a thing.\nOne of the most interesting dog-tech rivalries isthat of ZoolinguaversusBark GPT— software endeavoring to become our go-to Dr. Dolittle-esque translator. Both are still-evolving AI-powered apps that aim to decipher what exactly your dog is trying to say each time he or she barks.\nZoolingua is the buzzier of the two, led by Con Slobodchikoff, an animal behaviorist and CEO. He earned recognition thanks to a 2017The New York Timesarticle that rhapsodized over his undeniably cool research into prairie dogs, which boast one of the most advanced animal languages on earth. (They even have their own dialects.)\nSlobodchikoff latersaid to CBC, “[Zoolingua’s] idea is that … the device analyzes the dog’s body language and vocal signals and says, ‘I’m hungry’ or ‘Please let me out,’ ‘I need to pee’ or ‘You’re scaring me,’ or something along those lines.” Ultimately, he hopes to facilitate two-way communication between dogs and humans. “Imagine something as simple as pointing your cell phone at your dog and hearing a translation of what he or she is trying to communicate,”he sayson the Zoolingua website.\nSure, microchips can feel a little1984. But if your pup has a chip, they’re four times more likely to make it home if they get lost.\nBarkGPT, meanwhile, is currently in beta mode and bills itself as “the world’s first AI bark to speech translator.” Its founder-CEO, Alexandra Setter, is a dog walker–turned–MIT grad, with a background in machine learning. With BarkGPT, you upload the sound of your dog barking, and the app will tell you what they are trying to say. “Developing the machine-learning algorithm for BarkGPT was an incredibly challenging process for our team,”she saidon their website. “The satisfaction of seeing the impact BarkGPT has on the lives of dogs and their parents makes it all worth it. We remain dedicated to … strengthening the bond between dogs and humans.”\nMicrochips could be relegated to the past.\nThe prospect of losing a pet is a pretty upsetting one. Pet parents may forget to microchip their loved one or can’t afford to. Those chips could get damaged. And, while still good to have,old-school ID analog tagscan easily get lost. With that in mind, a handful of new tech is turning to biometrics — aka using physical characteristics to identify our pets — to supplant all of the above, plus nixing the need to register your pet with your veterinarian.\nThe pattern of a dog’s nose is purported to be as unique as a human fingerprint, and it’s drivingAI apps such as Petnow(Best of Innovation winner at CES 2022) developed by two engineering PhDs in Korea, to use that nose print to serve as a unique identifier. (Currently, the app analyzes cat’s faces, while it’s working on more robust, feline-specific tech.) “Having attained 99.99 percent matching accuracy for dogs, we are also seeking to progress our technology to cover cats, as well as cattle, in the near future,” the company’s chief operating officer, Meenho Sheen,told GlobalPETS.\n“A lot of these technologies will be able to be leveraged, integrated with your veterinarian, maybe even with animal welfare or the local police where a pet goes missing,” Dr. Robert explains. “They could have all this data.”\nGo ahead, make your morning routine a little easier.\nNever leave your pet home alone again.\nDo we want to spy on our animals when we’re not at home? You bet we do! Well, there are now a full suite of apps aimed at not just observing our pets, but responding to their needs and staying appraised of their wellness. “There’s a lot of opportunity here, making your life that much easier,” Dr. Robert says. “It’s hard to see a downside.”\nFacial recognition technology has transformed home security with devicessuch as the Petvation, which canopen pet doorsbased on their unique furry faces. The gadget’s sensors are infrared, meaning they work all day and night and don’t require a pet to look directly at its camera. Amazingly, they can detect when your pet wants to leave or enter your house, while also denying entry to other critters such as raccoons and squirrels — not to mention sneaky human beings.\n“Somebody’s Watching Me” will be their new favorite karaoke song.\nIn addition to providing extra home security (by detecting a rogue human), theFurbo 360° CameraandPetcubeare, at heart, pretty effective nannies for both dogs and cats. Through AI, these cams observe your animals all day long, so the software is able to distinguish between normal and irregular behaviors. This means that — in addition to tossing your pet treats and seeing, talking, and playing with them — these technologies will tip you off to more concerning behavior, such as excessive movement, pacing, vomiting, barking, and meowing. For cats, extra-smart litter boxes,such as Petivity,are also a godsend, monitoring when, how often, and for what reason your kitty uses the litter box, which can indicate a host of health issues.\nOther innovations, such as thelaser-wielding Felik, double as pet toys, tracking your cats and dogs throughout your abode and engaging them in play. Meanwhile, the dog-onlyCompanion appwill actually train your pooch, using AI and positive reinforcement.\nTurbocharge your pet’s healthcare.\nMaybe the most stunning use of artificial intelligence comes with how it could extend your pet’s lives. Antech Diagnostics (part of Mars Petcare) has been leading the way using AI forearly cancer detectionin cats and dogs, as well as a predictive tool forchronic feline kidney disease.\n\"We’re using the power of AI not only to understand how a pet’s genetics and behavior can reveal powerful insights about their overall health but also to help predict disease in pets so veterinarians and owners can better partner to keep pets healthy and happy,” Paulo de Castro, Mars’ CFO of Global Petcare,told.\nIt covers your pet so you can get that broken leg fixed — while keeping your wallet happy.\nThose possibilities are extending to pet parents, enabling us to detect abnormalities before a vet visit, which can sometimes come too late, given hesitations over the expense of veterinary care.PetGenomais an at-home DNA test that offers a complete evaluation of your dog’s genetic makeup, which you can use for early disease detection, as well as to design personalized health and nutrition regimes. Meanwhile, theTTcareapp (aCES 2023 Innovation honoree) uses artificial intelligence to analyze your dog’s and cat’s health from pictures of their eyes and skin. Your only learning curve will be to get them to sit still.\nIf you want to go deeper, theVetChip biosensorwill track all your pet’s vitals in real time (heart rate, breathing, temperature, oxygenation), and alert you to any abnormalities, such as fever, stress, and illness. Activity trackers are also getting futuristic: We prefer theWhistle smart collar, which tracks all dog activity (from licking and scratching to eating, drinking, and sleeping), detects allergies, and even offers poop-scanning.\n“If the owner notices that their pet is having some problems, and they bring it in to get looked at…you only know the pet has a problem. There’s no evidence. But if the owner has [video] tape and literature [digital reports], that diagnosis becomes much easier to make,” Dr. Robert says. “So, I think on one hand, we have the benefit of prevention. But then there’s the other issue, which is basically over diagnosis.”\nIn other words, with this great new power that AI imbues us, comes great responsibility. But we’re pet parents, so we already knew that, right?",

    "title": "Winter Is Here—Can Your Dog Suffer Seasonal Depression?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/seasonal-affective-disorder-in-dogs"
  },
  "page_content": "The new year is here, and with it: winter.Temperatures have dropped, darkness descends well before 6 p.m., and for some, the winter blues are setting in. Also known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD), this condition can express itself in humans as a lingering depression, fatigue, and social withdrawal. But what about our canine companions — does the change in season also affect their mood? The short answer is: probably. The longer answer is a little more complicated.\n“There’s a lot of confounding variables going on,” says Scott Sheaffer, acertified dog behavior consultantbased in Dallas, Texas. Scheaffer explains that what pet parents interpret as SAD in a dog might be a combination of physical factors as well as changes in human behavior. Below, Sheaffer walks us through some of the possible signs of SAD in dogs, and what you can do to help bring some pep back into their furry step.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nFirst of all, can dogs feel depressed?\n“Yes, they do!” Sheaffer says, quickly clarifying, “We don’t know thatthey’re actually depressed, of course, because we can’t interview them.” That being said, Sheaffer says it’s very likely they do experience something like depression, based both on their behavior (like humans, depressed dogs tend to appear withdrawn, lethargic, and disinterested) and the fact that dogs have been known to respond positively to antidepressants. “If you put those things together, you tend to think, yes, dogs are getting depressed.”\nDogs need more sleep than humans. Here’s how much is healthy.\nSimilarly, while we can’t sit a dog down and ask them directly whether they feel the winter doldrums, Sheaffer points out that humans and dogs share certain chemical similarities, which would suggest dogs might be susceptible to the changing of the seasons. Like humans, dogs produce melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate one’s sleep cycle. When it gets dark outside, the body produces more melatonin, which creates a feeling of drowsiness. Scientists believe that anoverproduction of melatoninwhen the days become shorter can contribute to SAD, and given that dogs produce the hormone as well, they may also be susceptible to the condition.\nWhat are the signs your dog might be experiencing SAD?\nAccording to Sheaffer, the biggest sign that your dog might be experiencing depression, seasonal or otherwise, is if they start seeming indifferent and lose interest in the things that previously brought them pleasure, like food, toys, or playtime. “Pretty much what you would see in a human that’s experiencing depression,” he says.\nAnd what to do to help them.\nStill, Sheaffer emphasizes that you should rule out physical ailments before immediately assuming that your dog is depressed. Physical discomfort might cause a dog to act lethargic or disinterested, and it’s important to address any underlying physical issues before trying to address the emotional issues. “Could it be that your dog is sick?” he suggests. “We think dogs might get headaches. Weknowdogs have gastrointestinal issues... Could that be it? We have to rule out those things.”\nWhat role do pet parents play in all of this?\n“Dogs are extremely perceptive,” Sheaffer says. While you may not be able to sit down and have aconversation with your dog, they are attuned to the subtleties in your body language and facial expressions. So, if you seem more lethargic and depressed, your dog may also start to seem down. Dogs are also sensitive to changes in routine, so if, in an attempt to avoid the cold, dreary weather, you’ve been taking your pup out on fewer walks and exercising them less, they may start to feel anxious and bored.\nIt was a trick question. A study shows that the pandemic has made us all codependent.\nWinter doesn’t have to mean perpetual gloom for you or your dog, though. It’s possible that less daylight means that pet parents are going out less and spending more time with their dogs, which would likely make their dogs happier. In short, dogs are always watching their owners for clues on how to behave and respond to their environment, so a change in their mood could be a reflection of a change in yours — positive or negative.\nHow can you help your dog if they seem depressed?\nWhether you’re trying to prevent your dog from feeling depressed, or trying to help a dog who already seems to be displaying symptoms of SAD, Sheaffer says that physical and mental stimulation are the keys to boosting a dog’s sense of wellbeing. And if you’re not sure how best to keep them stimulated, he adds that you can never go wrong with a good old-fashioned walk, which engages a dog both physically and mentally.\nThe author ofReturn to Natureon the mental health benefits of getting out into various natural landscapes with your pup.\n“When you take a spirited walk, especially in cooler weather, do you ever feel worse when you come back?” Sheaffer asks. “No! You feel better. So does your dog.” So, while dogs may be sensitive to the changing seasons, as long as you keep them properly engaged, they’ll be okay. “Most dogs, if you put them in a cave without sunlight where they have enough stimulation, they’ll be fine.”",

  "page_content": "Building trust and apositive relationshipwith a scared dog is a process that involves teaching your dog they can count on you not to scare them.Not scaring a dogmeans protecting them from situations that frighten them and working with them gradually to overcome their fears. It means never forcing them into situations that are too much for them, and it means proceeding only at the pace they can handle, not the paceyouwant.\nYou must provide lots of positive experiences that are not scary and that the dog can handle. It’s important to be the source of what makes them happy and what they enjoy so you are the one they count on to be safe and need not ever fear. That is how to gain a dog’s trust.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nEight ways to connect with your scared dog and build trust\nThere are two main strategies for building trust with a skittish dog. Be the source of good (unscary) experiences that lead to positive emotions for the dog, such as providing treats, playing with toys, and being both calm and gentle.\nNew Dog Training Programs\nTry these free training programs from our friends at Dogo to help with new dog life and basic obedience.\nDon’t be the source of bad (scary) experiences that lead to negative emotions for the dog, such as staring at them or other intimidating body language, loud chaos, or surprises. (Even if your dog is not skittish or nervous, this is how to get a dog to trust you and how to get a dog to like you.)\nThepurpose of the treatsis to get a skittish dog to associate you with positive emotions. The better the treats are, the easier that is. Experiment with a few kinds to see which are most appealing to them. Be generous with the treats; that makes it more likely the good feelings from treats can counteract the fears.\nSomething you can do every day is toss treats in their direction and then walk away while they eat them. They learn that you have treats, but also that you don’t put pressure on them to come to you to get them (that can be scary for fearful dogs!) and that you give them space every time to eat the treats.\nSome dogsreally love toys, and opportunities to play with them can open pups up to joy and fun after they’ve had rough times in their lives. Other fearful dogs who have suffered are too preoccupied with the basics of food, water, and safety to act playfully. Try calmly offering a fewdifferent types of toys, and see if they’re interested.\nAlso, understand that while they may not be interested now, that could change as they get more comfortable and relaxed. If they don’t take to toys right away, don’t give up — try again in the future. There is arguably nothing more rewarding and heartwarming than witnessing a rescue dog’sAha!moment when they joyfully play with a toy for the first time.\nLet the games begin.\nSome dogs do better with activity and motion than with the inherent tension of everyone standing still. Keep moving (try walking in big broad circles), and let them follow you and your other dogs, if you have them. Allow your dog to accompany you — or not — without paying any particular attention to them. This creates a low-pressure situation for many dogs, who will often join the movement.\nCalmness is comforting to fearful dogs, sobe calm in their presence. Speak in a soothing voice around your dog. Sit down in their presence, and avoid any sudden movements. Think about projecting calmness and steadiness as you would want anyone around you to do in a frightening situation.\nBe gentle in every interaction and move slowly. Avoid wildly waving your arms around as you talk. This is the one that’s hardest for me, personally, as I am one of those people who has a hard time expressing myself without using my hands.\nPrevious experiences or their genetic makeup (or both) — factors that are beyond your control — may limit a skittish dog’s capacity to interact. Continue to accept them forwho they are as an individual, respecting their limits and their timeline rather than pushing them to be like most dogs.\nBe patient and gentle. Eventually,your dog’s trust in you will grow, and their fear will diminish, but trying to rush your dog will only set you back rather than build the trust faster.\nBe predictable. If your dog knows what’s coming, they’ll be better able to handle it.Fearful dogs, including those who have not had a lot of interaction with people, do not like surprises.\nThey definitely don’t need you sneaking up on them, making sudden loud sounds, opening an umbrella near them, or doing anything else unexpected. Be predictable with your routines so, as much as possible, they know what to expect, and use cues to let your dog know what’s about to happen.\nEverything you need to know to get your new addition off to a good start.\nFor example, if you are about to feed your dog, say so, and if you are about to stand up, say so. When your dog learns that a certain word or phrase always predicts a certain action, it helps them feel more secure, which helps them trust you more.\nThere are many ways that we humans can make ourselves appear less intimidating to dogs. It helps to turn a little to the side rather than face them head on and to shift our body weight back away from them. Crouching down and staying at a distance are also effective. If you must approach, do so slowly rather than in a rush.\nSkip wearing a hat or backpack or carrying things, including boxes and clipboards when they’re around. This will help avoid setting nervous dogs off. Avert your eyes and don’t stare directly at them. Let them approach you rather than you going to them. If you have a beard, you could shave it off. That is a big commitment and asking a lot, but it can help you appear less intimidating to dogs.\nSo many dogs find all our talking anything but reassuring. Dogs don’t vocalize as much as people do, and many dogs who are fearful or skittish at all seem to relish the peace and quiet of silence from us. This doesn’t mean we have to be silent in our own homes or that we can’t communicate normally with the other humans in our homes. It does mean that prattling on in sweet tones or baby talk to our new friend could be counterproductive when the goal is to build trust with a scared dog.\nWhat if my dog is scared because they were previously abused?\nThere is no difference between how you treata fearful dog who was abused, compared with how you treat a fearful dog who wasn’t abused. You help them overcome their fears the same way, regardless of the cause.\nWhy is my dog scared of a specific type of person?\nFear in a dog is often because that type of person appears intimidating or because they have not been exposed to that type of person enough, especially as a young dog.\nWith patience and positive reinforcement, you can do a lot to make up for lost time with socialization.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nDogs arefearful for many reasons, includinggenetic tendencies, lack of adequate socialization, pain or underlying medical conditions, and past trauma such as being attacked, abused, or extremely startled.\nDogs become more confident if they have many positive experiences and if they have lots of training experiences where they are reinforced for their behavior.\nIdentifying the reason your dog is so scared is not always possible, but clues can be found in their past experiences, the behavior of their genetic relatives, and the specificity of their fears.\nWhen you see a dog scared of everything, it is likely because the dog’s genetics give them a tendency to be fearful or because theywere not adequately socialized, or possibly a combination of the two factors.",

  "page_content": "Is there anything sadder than the sound of a puppy whining? Even people who don’t consider themselves dog people would be hard-pressed toignore the pitiful-sounding criesof a sad puppy. But does whiningreallymean that a puppy is sad, or is it possible that your puppy is whining for no reason?\nWhether your puppy is keeping you up whining at night, whining in their crate no matter how cozy you make it, or you’re simply hoping todecipher their puppy-whining sounds, read on for answers.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhy do puppies whine?\nWhy is my puppy whining?It’s a common question coming from new pet parents — after all, a puppy whining is as common asa baby crying. (And any parent knows babies cancry.)\nPuppies whine as a form of communication, expressing various needs or emotions. Common reasons for whining include seeking attention, expressing anxiety or fear, signaling discomfort or pain, or even expressing excitement. Understanding the specific context of the whining is crucial in addressing it effectively. If whining persists and is potentially linked to discomfort or pain, a visit to the veterinarian is recommended.\n“Puppies whine for many reasons, but most whining falls into one of three categories: physical discomfort, loneliness, and boredom,” says Lorrie Reynolds, owner ofMaximum Fun Dog Sports. Let’s take them one by one.\n“Pain” may be too strong of a word, depending on the situation, but whining may indicate some sort of physical distress, Reynolds says. These can include needing to pee or poop, being too hot or cold, or experiencing hunger pangs (puppieslike to eat— a lot).\n“Until you brought them home, your puppy was surrounded by their mother and siblings, as well as their breeder and family,” Reynolds says. It’s only natural that there is a period of adjustment to their new home.\nOnce again, it turns out puppies aren’t that different from human children. “Puppies also whine when they are bored or over-tired,” Reynolds says. “Just like toddlers, young puppies don’t know when they really need that nap, and whining can indicate that your puppy needs to sleep.”\nBabies cry, puppies whine, and both are absolutely normal behaviors. Whining is one of the best ways puppies have of communicating; like babies, they don’t have a wide vocabulary with which to express themselves. Barking, howling, and whining are about it — though those notoriouspuppy dog eyessure can say a thousand words.\nHow to stop puppies from whining\nAlthough whining is normal, that doesn’t mean it should ever be ignored. In order to figure out how to get a puppy to stop whining, you need to figure out why they’re upset — and the first order of business is finding out whether they arein physical distress. “Puppies need to know that you are reliable and they can count on you to take care of them,” Reynolds says. If they’re uncomfortable, it’s very important that you respond.” To that end, here’s a three-step plan to help a whimpering puppy.\nWhen you’ve gotta go, you’ve gotta go — and puppies aren’t going to be stoic about it. A quick walk (or placing them on a puppy pad indoors) will do the trick if this is the case.\nGetting bigger overnightburns up a lot of calories, so a snack may help a growing pup with a growling tummy. (Doesn’t a treat usually help you stop crying, too?)\nSince puppies are likely to get both lonely and tired, cuddling up for a nap together might be just what the doctor (er, veterinarian) ordered. That’s right —napping with your new petis good for both of you (especially if you’re suffering from a case ofthe puppy blues).\nA bored puppy is often a whiny puppy. To save your pooch from boredom, Reynolds suggests giving them a toy. “Rubber toys that are hollow (I like the Kong brand) can be filled with kibble and a little bit of yogurt and frozen. It will take your puppy quite a while to get all of the treats out.”\nHow to help a puppy who whines in the crate\nCrate-trainingis a fact of life for puppies — or at least, it should be, Reynolds says. “All puppies and dogs should be crate trained. You don’t want your dog’s first experience with a crate to be for an emergency at the veterinarian or in a boarding kennel,” she says. “Crate-training a puppy keeps them safe when you can’t watch them, to ensure they’re not chewing on or eating things they shouldn’t, and it makes house training significantly easier if puppies are confined when you can’t watch them.”\nThat said, puppies often whine when they’re in the crate. To curb this, try the following:\n“To make crate-training easier on your puppy, make sure you are playing with them after they’ve gone out to eliminate so they’re tired and ready to nap when you crate them,” Reynolds says.\nNot only will this make the crate extra comfy, your scent will comfort your puppy when you can’t be there to snuggle them. Choose a soft sweater or blanket to sleep with for a few nights, then transfer it to the crate (without washing it, of course).\nReynolds suggests making certain favorite toys special “crate-only” toys, so the crate becomes an appealing place for your pup, as well as feeding your puppy in the crate. “The association of the crate with a safe, fun, and food-filled place will eliminate that puppy whining before you know it,” she says.\n“If your puppy is whining at night, move their crate close to your bed, where you can softly reassure them that you are there,” Reynolds says. “Keep the crate close to you, gradually moving it further away over time until your puppy is comfortable being crated in a different room without whining.”\nThe more you play with, talk to, and cuddle with your puppy when they’re not in the crate, the easier it will be for them to adjust to alone time in the crate. “Make sure you are spending a lot of time with your puppy between sessions alone in a crate for naps,” Reynolds says.\nIf you’re thinking of letting your puppy “cry it out,” think again. Caroline Wilkinson, a certified canine behaviorist and founder of digital pet coaching serviceBarket Place, says ignoring your puppy’s cries can undermine your bond.\n“It’s really important that we’re present for our puppies, especially in the early days, so that they can learn to trust us and build a solid foundation for our ongoing relationship. Whining is a way of our puppies expressing a need, so it’s important to try andmeet whatever that need is.”\nOther tips for handling whining puppies\nReynolds offers a few more tips for keeping puppy whining to a minimum. If your puppy is crying and you can’t figure out why, go down this checklist:\nIf your puppy hasn’t been out to poop or pee in the past hour, take them out.\nIf your puppy hasn’t been out to poop or pee in the past hour, take them out.\nMake sure your pup is on a feeding schedule that has been recommended by your breeder or veterinarian, and that you have fed them the correct amount so they aren’t hungry.\nMake sure your pup is on a feeding schedule that has been recommended by your breeder or veterinarian, and that you have fed them the correct amount so they aren’t hungry.\nIf your pup seems to have other symptoms of being ill (lethargy, diarrhea, vomiting, etc., call your vet immediately).\nIf your pup seems to have other symptoms of being ill (lethargy, diarrhea, vomiting, etc., call your vet immediately).\nFAQs (People also ask):\nWhen do puppies stop whining? It varies, but generally, experts say it will decrease after a few weeks in their new home.\nA puppy who suddenly starts whining is trying to tell you something, so pay attention. If they’re not hungry, don’t need to pee or poo, and you’re right there with them, it may be time for a trip to the vet.\n“For excessive whining that doesn’t get better when your puppy has been outside, fed, and played with, always check with your veterinarian to make sure there is not a physical reason for the complaints,” Reynolds says.\nWilkinson concurs: “If your puppy is whining a lot of the time then it’s definitely important to get them checked out via your vet to ensure no underlying pain or discomfort is present.”",

    "title": "Does Your Dog Need Anti-Anxiety Meds?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/does-anxiety-medication"
  },
  "page_content": "The importance of protecting our mental health has gotten a lot of press in recent years, thanks (no thanks!) to a global pandemic — and all the nerves and isolation that came with it. But humans aren’t the ones who need to protect our mental wellbeing; our pups can experience anxiety, too. Their lives might look cushy to us (we’re paying their rent, after all), but trauma, lack of socialization, and just plain-oldnoisy thundercan have real effects on your dog’s psyche.\nSo, how can you help your dog with their anxiety? We asked a few veterinarians how they diagnose anxiety in animals, what behavioral changes pet parents should make first, and when it’s time to think about prescribing Prozac. Anti-anxiety medication may be an option for dogs with severe anxiety that interferes with their daily lives. Talk to your veterinarian to determine if medication is right for your dog and to choose the correct type and dosage. Be aware of the potential side effects, such as drowsiness and decreased appetite.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nSigns of depression or anxiety\nDepression in dogs often mimics that in humans: They will act withdrawn or isolate themselves, they’ll lose interest in activities they usually love, and there will be changes in theirappetiteorsleeping habits. On the other hand, unaccountableaggression, accidents in the house despite beingpotty-trained, and other destructive behaviors all point to anxiety. “There are a number of behaviors a pet parent may see, including pacing, excessive panting, trembling, whining orvocalizing, holding the tail down, andlickingparts of the body excessively, such as the front paws,” veterinarian and Kinship Collective memberDr. John Iovinosays. “There can be many other odd behaviors that don’t fit the normal, which can also allude to potential anxiety, such as escapist behavior.”\nDogs need more sleep than humans. Here’s how much is healthy.\nThese signs can signal a medical condition, so if your dog isn’t acting like themself, the first step it to get a full workup at your vet to check for any underlying causes. Until then, don’t try to snap your pet out of their sulk when they could be suffering fromarthritisor an illness. Once your vet rules out health issues and injuries, you can take anxiety or depression into account.\nCommon causes of anxiety\nDoes your pet go wild when you leave them alone, chewing everything from wires to the wall from stress? Or does the sound of a car backfiring orFourth of July fireworksleave them cowering in a corner, unable to shake the fear? A 2020studyfound that 72 percent of dogs suffer from anxiety — with separation, fear of strangers, and sensitivity to noise to blame for most of the cases. Same, dogs, same.\n“One common reason [for anxiety] is lack of socialization as dogs grow and develop,” Dr. Iovino says. “The more events and experiences a dog can have, the calmer they can be when challenged with negative experiences. In addition, dogs can develop fear or anxiety towards other dogs if they have a bad experience such as getting into a fight with another dog.”\nOther causes include “separation anxiety, noise phobias, and sometimes even items of clothing, like a hat,” veterinarian Dr. Seth Vredenburg adds. “There are so many things that our dogs may see as strange or unusual that can cause some level of anxiety. How we react to these things may influence our dog’s reaction.”\nDepression in dogs is less common, and thus less often treated medically. But big changes in the household — from the addition of a new pet to theloss of another pet— can cause a dog to become despondent. Unlike us, pets usually bounce back quickly from depressive episodes, and rewarding happy behavior, such as playfulness and a wagging tail, will hasten the healing process. If their mood doesn’t lighten, a vet may prescribe medication as a temporary measure to take the edge off.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nHow can you treat anxiety in dogs?\nMany veterinarians will recommend making behavioral changes first to see if that alleviates your dog's anxiety. Use different techniques and training depending on the type of anxiety — separation or situational, for example. You can look into natural remedies, such as exercise and even massage. If you do want to pursue medication, it's best to do so alongside the help of a trainer or behaviorist who can support your dog during the process.\nTraining before medicating\nDr. Sara Ochoa, a veterinarian atWhitehouse Veterinary Hospital, recommends making behavioral changes before resorting to medication. “[For separation anxiety] start by training your dog to learn to stay home alone. This usually starts with leaving for a few minutes at a time, then coming right back inside,” she says.  “Going forward, don’t make a big deal when you leave the house and slowly increase your time away as your dog gets more comfortable. And if you come home and they haven’t been destructive, reward them with praise and atreat.”\nFor situational anxiety, removing your dog from what’s triggering them may seem like an obvious solution. But if the phobia is unavoidable, like fireworks, aThundershirt, CBD treats, and calming pheromones likeAdaptilcan alleviate some anxiety. “Long term, what will mostly help calm a dog down during anxious events is working diligently to desensitize them to this fear through training techniques,” Dr. Iovino says. “This process can take weeks to months before you see less anxiety.”\nDoes your dog freak out when you head for the door? Here’s some advice.\nNatural remedies for anxiety in dogs\nThere are several natural remedies you can try out to see if they alleviate your dog's anxiety: starting with the simplest solution for many pups, which is exercise! Making sure your dog gets enough physical activity during the day can help relieve their stress and anxiety. Another pretty easy remedy is attention: give your dog plenty of affection (if they appreciate it) and training time to wear off some of that nervous energy and make them feel engaged. Natural remedies also include relaxing massage (yes, there are dog masseuses!) and acupuncture, which can relieve anxiety. Some dogs are also receptive to calming music—you can find playlists on YouTube likethis.\nWhen anxiety meds can help dogs\nDoes your dog need anxiety meds? Anti-anxiety medication can put your dog in a calmer state of mind so that they’re able to better absorb the training, but medication isn’t a silver bullet. If you don’t have a lot of dog training experience, it’s probably a good idea to hire a professional behaviorist. “Just putting your pet on medication isn’t enough — you have to change their behavior as well — but itcanhelp,” says Dr. Ashley Rossman, a veterinarian atGlen Oak Dog and Cat Hospital.\nWhen should you talk to your veterinarian about anti-anxiety medication for your dog?\nWhen you have tried training and natural techniques and nothing is working to minimize your dog's anxiety, you should consult your vet. Ask your vet to examine your dog if they continue to have anxiety after four to six weeks of attempting prevention techniques. Your vet should be able advise on whether to consider anti-anxiety medication based on their assessment of your dog’s anxiety symptoms.\nHow does anxiety medication work for dogs?\nGenerally, anti-anxiety medication works by boosting the levels of chemicals called neurotransmitters in your dog's brain. They boost the levels of norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by increasing their production or by blocking them from being reabsorbed into nerve cells. These changes in the dog’s brain reduce symptoms of anxiety over time.\nThere are different types of antidepressants drugs for dogs, it depends on the situation and their symptoms. Your vet will likely consider canine anxiety drugs, such as Prozac, Xanax, Amitriptyline, Buspirone, Clomicalm, Sileo, Valium, Ativan, Paxil, and Zoloft. If a few of these sound familiar, it’s because some human anti-anxiety medication has been FDA-approved for use in dogs — but don’t give your dog your pills, because they can have awful side effects includingincreasedanxieties and irregular heart rate when not prescribed and dosed by a licensed veterinarian.\nDr. Ochoa typically turns to Prozac for separation anxiety and aggression. If your pet has more intermittent anxiety (again: fireworks), she’ll opt for calming Trazadone. “Some dogs also need a calming medication when they go to the vet’s office or groomer,” she adds.\nWhat are the side effects of anti-anxiety medication in dogs?\nAlthough anti-anxiety drugs are generally well tolerated in dogs, side effects of anxiety medication vary depending on the type of drug, dosage, how long they’ve been taking it and your pup’s sensitivity to it. Side effects of long-acting drugs, such as Tricyclic Antidepressants, can include sedation, dry mouth, lack of appetite,vomiting, and diarrhea. Another class of long-acting drugs for dogs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has fewer side effects also including sedation, loss of appetite, and changes in behavior.\nBy comparison, short-acting anti-anxiety medication can be used when dogs are triggered in certain situations such as thunderstorms or going to the vet. These include benzodiazepines, which are sedatives that can calm your dog down if they have separation anxiety, for example. Side effects include sedation and sleeplessness. Another class of short-acting medication is called Trazodone, an antidepressant that affects serotonin levels. Reported side effects include lethargy, hyperactivity and aggression.\nA vet explains why the weather isn’t always to blame.\nLong-term treatment\nProzac may not be a DEA-controlled substance and is generally well-tolerated by humans and animals alike, but all medication requires monitoring. “I like to check bloodwork at least once a year when dogs are on it,” Dr. Rossman says. It isn’t a quick fix either. Some dogs will need anxiety medication for the rest of their lives, while others can be weaned off it if they respond to training.\nUltimately, it depends on the individual dog and the severity of their behavior. Dr. Rossman adds: “Sometimes it takes a couple of weeks to hit a steady-state level, so dogs are normally [medicated] for at least a few months to get a feeling for how it’s working. It’s a long-term commitment.”\nDisclaimer alert: This article is here to share information. But, much like pineapple on pizza, the topic may be controversial. Meaning, not all vets or pet professionals agree. Because every pet is a unique weirdo with specific needs. So, don’t take this as fact or medical advice. Talk things over with your vet when making decisions, and use your best judgment (about both your pet’s health and pizza toppings).\nFAQs (People also ask):\nDogs who suffer from situational anxiety may be triggered by car rides, trips to the vet or groomer, thunderstorms, fireworks, being boarded, orbeing around loud children.\nIf your pet has more situational anxiety, caused by fireworks for example, your vet may prescribe one of the short-acting medications to relieve stress in that moment.\nReferences:\nA Review of Pre-Appointment Medications to Reduce Fear and Anxiety in Dogs and Cats at Veterinary Visits\nA Review of Pre-Appointment Medications to Reduce Fear and Anxiety in Dogs and Cats at Veterinary Visits\nRandomized, Placebo-Controlled Prospective Clinical Trial Evaluating the Efficacy of the Assisi Anti-anxiety Device (Calmer Canine) for the Treatment of Canine Separation Anxiety\nRandomized, Placebo-Controlled Prospective Clinical Trial Evaluating the Efficacy of the Assisi Anti-anxiety Device (Calmer Canine) for the Treatment of Canine Separation Anxiety\nThe use of imepitoin (Pexion™) on Fear and Anxiety Related Problems in Dogs — a Case Series\nThe use of imepitoin (Pexion™) on Fear and Anxiety Related Problems in Dogs — a Case Series\nNatural Remedies for Dog Anxiety\nNatural Remedies for Dog Anxiety\nWhat’s Important to Know About Treating Dogs with Anxiety\nWhat’s Important to Know About Treating Dogs with Anxiety\nMedications and Dog Anxiety\nMedications and Dog Anxiety",

  "page_content": "That work-from-home life is something some of us have been doing for years. The COVID-19 started nearly four years ago, and we’ve gotten used to terms like “hybrid working,” which means wedohave to leave the house sometimes. Or maybe your company wants you to be back full-time for those in-person board room meetings and Wednesday happy hours. No matter your reality, your pup doesn’t see you as much as they did for a couple years there, and it stresses them out. It’s beyond time to startseparation anxiety-training with your dog.\nWhat is separation anxiety in dogs?\nSeparation anxietyis a common behavioral disorder in dogs that occurs when a dog experiences panic or fear when they’re left alone. It can be treated with enrichment, training, and medication. It’s important to be patient and consistent because treatment can take time. If you are struggling to help your dog, consider working with a certified professional dog trainer or behaviorist.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nHow does separation-anxiety training work?\nWhensomeone is scared— dogs, cats, people, you name it — you can teach them to overcome their fear by using a behavioral psychology process called systematic desensitization. Basically, you introduce the thing that is scary but at a level that is not scary.\nSo, if you want to help your dog overcome their fear, you’d first need to figure out how far away they can be from whatever is causing their fear without being scared. Let’s say that distance is 10 feet away. That means you’d start your training at 10 feet away when your dog is completely relaxed. Great. Let’s see if you can inch a little closer. Nine feet away — still no problem. Eight feet — you’re good. Seven feet —gulp! Way too close. Let’s back ’er up a bit…7.5 feet — all good. Little by little, you move closer, but only as long as your pup still feels fine. The key is controlling that distance so that they can always feel safe.\nDoes your dog freak out when you head for the door? Here’s some advice.\nUnderstanding separation anxiety in dogs\nLet’s apply this to dogs who are scared to be alone now. Pups are not dummies. They’ve figured out that every time the keys make that jingly sound or the jacket goes on, their people leave through that door, and their terror begins. They tell us they’re anxious bygiving us signals.\nDogs with separation anxiety will whimper, stiffen, yawn, lick their lips,bark, howl, jump up to the door knob, scratch and chew the door (or the frame and the floor), lose their bladders orbreak out of their cratesand cut themselves in the process.\nAll of those behaviors are rooted in fear. Notice how your dog does not do that when someone else is there? They’re scared when they’re alone, and so if you stop scaring them, the“bad” behaviorsgo away, too.\nIt’s 2023, and the office is calling. How can our dogs cope?\nHow to train a dog with separation anxiety\nRather than thinking of separation anxiety-training as something to “teach your dog that you always come back,” think of it as training to “teach your dog that nothing bad ever happens when you walk out the door.” In order to do that, you have to watch theirbody languageto control how long you are gone.\nWhen you turn your door knob, does your dog fly to the door? If so, don’t turn the door knob yet. Just walk to the door and go back and sit down. Can you open the door halfway, but all the way is too far? Fine, only open it halfway until your dog doesn’t even look up when you go to do that. Can you stand outside with the door closed for one second, but two seconds is too long? OK! Great info. Keep it under two seconds. Get the idea?\nPick one or two times a day to do 30 minutes of alone-time exercises, five to six days a week. Practice the actions leading up to leaving your dog alone to teach your pup there is nothing to fear. You’ll do this by grabbing the keys, turning the door, or walking to the door — whatever their tolerance level is. Don’t push them; ensure their body language stays positive. The goal is to show them it’s safe.\nMake sure your dog is totally relaxed before you leave again. If you leave while they're still excited about your previous return, they will be too aroused for the next trial and have less tolerance, which could make the issue worse (not better).\nIf your dog is panting, yawning, salivating, pacing, or trembling, they are too stressed for you to continue. Back up and shorten how long you leave them alone until they are relaxed again. Then continue building up their tolerance — slowly.\nAs the old saying goes, “A tired dog is a good dog. Exercising your dog’s body and mind is a good way to decrease their stress so they're less anxious when you leave the house. Make sure your dog is getting plenty of exercise, and play fun, interactive games with them.\nWe asked both animal behaviorists and human psychologists howyoucan deal with leaving your dog home alone.\nKeep training as they get better.\nAs your dog gets used to simple acts like walking to the door and touching the handle, introduce departure-related objects (keys, jackets, purse) one at a time. Mix up the training regiment with easy and more complex tasks. For example, walk to the door and turn the handle halfway; other times, grab your jacket and put on your shoes before doing so.\nTeach your dog that nothing bad ever happens when you walk out the door before anything bad does happen. Up to 55 percent of dogs worldwide exhibit some kind of separation-related problem, so why risk that happening to your dog, too? Tackle the issue before it becomes a problem.\nFAQs (People also ask):\nIt depends. If your dog feels that their crate is their safe place, then crate training should work for them. If your dog shows signs of distress in their crate, it's probably not a good idea.\nYes, hiring a dog trainer or animal behaviorist can help improve your dog's separation anxiety.\nResources:\nSeparation anxiety in dogs: What progress has been made in our understanding of the most common behavioral problems in dogs?\nSeparation anxiety in dogs: What progress has been made in our understanding of the most common behavioral problems in dogs?\nSeparation Anxiety\nSeparation Anxiety",

These days, following a global pandemic,record-high student debt, and climate change, there’s a lot to keep our brains whirring at a constant breakneck pace. But, have you ever had anyone suggest that your dog, whose brain, and subsequently, body seems to operate at the same high-energy levels, is that waybecauseof you? It’s not an easy pill to swallow, especially if you’ve spent your whole life trying not to let your anxiety define you, and who are they to suggest that anyway? Rude.

She specializes in working with dogs who have behavior problems and their parents. When I asked her if dogs who were brought to her canine behavior clinic with anxiety issues tended to have nervous parents, her response was immediate: “Yes, indeed.

Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nCompression vests, interactive toys, and pheromone sprays will be game-changers this Fourth of July.\nAnd when I asked Carri Westgarth, author ofThe Happy Dog Owner(2021) whether she had noticed that fearful, shy dogs tended to have anxious parents, she said, “Absolutely!” These observations are consistent with a growing body of research showing similarities in the personalities of dogs and their parents. The first systematic research on this topic was reported in a1997 paperby the anthrozoologists Anthony Podberscek and James Serpell.\nIn their paper they used the “Cattell 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire” — a personality test that was popular at the time. They compared the personalities of pet parents with English Cocker Spaniels who were classified as aggressive with parents of Cocker Spaniels labeled as non-aggressive. They found the parents ofaggressive dogswere more likely to be tense, emotionally less stable,shyer, and more undisciplined than parents of dogs without a history of aggression.\nThe Five-Factor Model of Personality\nOver the past couple of decades, personality research has been dominated by theFive-Factor Model. This is the theory that individual differences in human personality boil down to five basic dimensions: (1) openness to new experiences, (2) conscientiousness, (3) extroversion, (4) agreeableness, and (5) neuroticism. Some researchers now refer to the neuroticism trait as “negative emotionality” or “emotional instability.” And some investigators prefer to reverse the terminology of the neuroticism scale scores and call the trait “emotional stability.” In this case, people who are more anxious are said to have low emotional stability.\nWe asked both animal behaviorists and human psychologists howyoucan deal with leaving your dog home alone.\nStudies Show Nervous Parents Tend to Have Nervous Dogs\nOver a dozen studies have now found relationships between at least some Big Five traits in pet parents and the behavior of their pets. The most consistent findings, however, focus on the factor usually labeled “neuroticism.” People who score high on this factor often experience negative emotions such as fear, guilt, anxiety, and stress. Here is a sample of these findings.\nA research team led by veterinary behaviorist Nicholas Dodmanexamined the relationship between Big Five personality traitsof 1,564 dog parents and 17 problematic behaviors in their pets. Parents who scored low on the “emotional stability” trait (had high negative emotionality scores) had dogs that had 13 of the behavior issues. These included aggression directed toward their parents, aggression toward other dogs,fear, attention-seeking andseparation anxiety, andpersistent barking.\nA research team led by veterinary behaviorist Nicholas Dodmanexamined the relationship between Big Five personality traitsof 1,564 dog parents and 17 problematic behaviors in their pets.

On all of the Big Five traits, parents rated their dogs’ personalities as similar to themselves, but the parents’ and dogs’ personality scores were most similar for negative emotionality. In the study, the researchers controlled for the possibility that pet parents might be projecting their insecurities on their pets — they also had family members rate the personalities of the parents and their dogs. Again, pet parents rated by family members as being high in negative emotionality also had dogs who were anxious and fearful.\nResearchersat the Clever Dog Lab in Vienna and the Family Dog Project in Budapest had pet parents complete the Big Five Personality Inventory for themselves and a canine version for their dog.

The “Causal Arrow” Problem\nPatricia McConnell, the author of many books on dog behavior, includingThe Other End of the Leashabout dog-to-human communication, asked me, “So, Hal: Which comes first, the nervous dog or the nervous dog parent?” Good question.\nOne possibility is that the like-owner/like-dog phenomenon is simply a matter of perception — in other words, anxious pet parents project their anxieties on their pets. The Austrian and Hungarian researchers, however, controlled for this possibility by having outside observers in their study rate the behaviors of the dogs. It could be that anxious dog parents are attracted to nervous and emotionally sensitive dogs and seek them out as pets. After all, social psychologists have found people choose friends and romantic partners with similar personalities to their own.\nResearch finds that your pup can smell when you’ve been doom-scrolling, and they get bummed out.\nAnother possibility is that the causal arrow could point up the leash from dogs to their parents. Living with a fearful, aggressive, and emotionally unstable dog might increase their parents’ levels of stress and anxiety. But the canine behavior researcher James Serpell told me about anew studyfrom Portugal that suggested a different mechanism might be at play: emotional contagion. It turns out that a slew of studies have found that dogs respond to human emotions. The researchers wrote of their findings: “The results suggest that dogs’ ‘empathetic trait’ (i.e., emotional reactivity to their owners’ emotions)… may explain the observed association between owners’ and dogs’ anxiety.)”\nDog behaviorist Kim Brophey believes the emotional contagion hypothesis makes sense, particularly for some breeds. She wrote to me, “Many breeds have been particularly selected for attentiveness to and relationships with humans...They are especially at risk for absorbing the emotional state of their human counterparts.” My best guess? She is right.",

And how many skipped meals should you allow before you take your pup to the vet for an expert opinion?\nA dog without an appetite can definitely be a cause for concern, but there are multiple reasons why your dog may just not be into their food. Here, learn about the loss of appetite in dogs and what you can do to persuade your picky pup to chow down.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nWhat causes loss of appetite in dogs?\nSo, what causes a dog not to eat? Before you start worrying about severe illness, take a look at your home and life. Changes to a dog’s environment or new additions to the family can be just as likely to limit your pet’s appetite as sickness. And while appetite loss is a very common sign of illness, it’s usually accompanied by other symptoms, so don’t freak out unless your dog also experiences vomiting, diarrhea, or another sign of illness.Temperature and what your dog ate the day before can also be a contributor to why your dog is not eating. Some dogs eatwaytoo much and other dogs are very good at regulating their food intake. If you notice it getting hotter, your dog may be lying around more and in turn does not need as many calories that day. They may end up eating less overall. If you overfed your dog the day before they may regulate what they are going to take in the following day.\nIf you’ve ever felt nervous about starting a new job or moving to a new place, you should be able to sympathize with a dog who’s adapting to a new environment. Whether you just adopted your pup from the animal rescue centre or you’ve moved to a new apartment or home, any change in a dog’s routine or surroundings can cause stress and even put a dampener on their appetite.\nSo, if you notice your newly adopted dog not eating, have a little patience. Usually, a dog will return to their normal eating habits once they’ve grown accustomed to the new situation — generally in just a few days.\nIf your dog has always maintained a healthy appetite but suddenly won’t even look at their food, it may be a sign of illness. Look for other changes like weight loss and symptoms like vomiting or diarrhea and contact your vet ASAP if you notice any. A lack of appetite accompanies a lot of serious illnesses, like pancreatitis, liver and kidney disease, chronic gut issues, and cancer, so it’s best to get your dog checked out as soon as you can.\nSome dogs may not refuse all food, just certain ingredients, which usually means that there’s nothing wrong – you just have a picky eater on your hands. Dogs often become picky if they’re frequently fed human food, fed at inconsistent times, or have enjoyed a wide variety of foods and flavors.\nPuppies especially tend to be picky eaters but often adjust to their new home and diet over time. If your dog has enjoyed the taste of chicken nuggets or other goodies, they may be a little less than enthused about their dry dog food, so try somehealthy snacksto encourage their appetite.\nWhile a change in environment can be a source of anxiety, any change in a household can throw a dog’s appetite off. That includes things like a new job that keeps you away from home more often, a new pet or baby in the home, or a death in the family.\nAny stress can make your dog anxious andcause disruptionsin both their appetite and normal behavior. If you’re going through a big life change, try to pay a little extra attention to your dog and work to keep their routine as normal as you can.\nMany medications and vaccinations can have unexpected side effects, such as temporary appetite loss. However, this should pass within a day or two. If your dog is still struggling to show interest in food, try feeding them some plain chicken and rice or schedule a visit with your vet.\nIf you’ve ever had a toothache, you know the last thing you feel like doing is eating. The same thing can happen to your dog, so check their mouth for anything that may be caught in their teeth or gums. Look out for signs of dental issues like a bad odor, loose teeth, or excess tartar buildup. If you notice a potential problem with your dog’s teeth, it’s time to visit the vet.\nIf your dog stopped eating a food they’ve enjoyed for years, the food itself may be to blame. Try a new package of food to see if your dog likes that better, and if not, there may have been an ingredient change that your pup just doesn’t agree with. Consider trying a new food brand or flavor.\nSome dogs just won’t eat when their human parents aren’t around. Remember that dogs are pack animals, and they may feel more comfortable eating with you close by. Try to feed your dog well before you have to go anywhere so you can keep them company while they enjoy their meal.\nThey may be tiny, but their appetites arenot.\nWhen should I be concerned about my dog’s lack of appetite?\nSo, how long can a dog go without eating? If your dog skips a few meals but then begins eating normally again, there’s likely nothing to worry about. However, if your dog hasn’t eaten anything for 24 to 48 hours, reach out to your vet.

Recent research has found that long-lasting chew toys are a great way to keep pups busy when they they have to do some solo time at home.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nLong-lasting chews are a dog’s best friend, too\nIn astudy published in February, dogs stayed engaged with along-lasting chew toyfor longer than they stayed engaged with the other enrichment options. They also exhibited less stress and more positive emotions when they had a long-lasting chew, compared with when they were offered the other options.\nLong-lasting chews were the most effective way to keep dogs engaged and in more positive emotional states with less stress than the other options in the study. The long-lasting chews were better than toys with food and automatically dispensed food, plus a voice from a person talking to them in a happy way.\nChew toys, food toys and automatic, food-dispensing toys\nThe study investigated the effects of different food-based enrichment options for dogs who were left alone to determine which kept them occupied for the longest time. The study also assessed which options keep dogs in the happiest state of mind so those alone times do not have to be so sad or stressful.\nDoes your dog freak out when you head for the door? Here’s some advice.\nThe researchers attempted to keep dogs happy by offering them a long-lasting chew, a Kong wobbler with kibble in it, and an automatic food-dispensing toy with kibble. The automatic food-dispensing toy was used in two ways: accompanied by a person’s voice and without a person’s voice.\nA treat was delivered once a minute, whether or not there was a person talking to the dog. The voice was always a woman speaking in a high-pitched happy voice. She spoke before each treat was delivered, saying things like, “Hello, Max, are you being a good boy? Would you like a treat?” and “Guess what, I’ve got some more treats for you! Coming your way now!”\nThe experience of the dogs in the study\nResearchers recorded video of 10 Labrador Retrievers and 10 Petit Basset Griffon Vendéens for 20 minutes with each of the enrichment options. The dogs in the study were each left alone four times so every dog had the opportunity to try all four of the options for enrichment in isolation. Experts watched the videos and recorded the emotional state of the dog throughout the experiment and the amount of time they stayed interested in the food or chew.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nFuture research\nDogs tend to like food and chew toys, but they don’t typically like being left alone, so exploring how to use the former to help make the latter easier is worth your while. Much more research needs to be done, though. I would like to know how long-lasting chews compare with a toy stuffed with really high-quality food such as chicken, steak, or peanut butter, instead of kibble for helping keep dogs happy when they are alone. I also want to know which long-lasting chews make dogs the happiest and keep them occupied when they must be alone.\nIt’s an exciting time to be a dog (and to have a dog) because scientists are studying what makes them happy and what we can do to keep their quality of life high. We don’t like leaving our dogs, but it’s a little easier when science lets us know what to do in that situation for the benefit of our dogs.",

  "page_content": "When you first bring home a puppy, your priorities might go like this: get in the maximum number of cuddles, make sure they get those puppy naps in, and keep them from chewing every single item in your home. You might not be thinking about another very important part of puppy development: socialization.\nJust as it’s good for babies to meet other babies — even if all they do is stare at each other — puppies need to see and interact with other dogs. So, in addition to the oodles of cuddles on your prio list, make sure you add a social hour or two to your pup’s weekly schedule.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhy is socialization important for my fearful dog?\nI have a six-month-old named Gator who is a super shy puppy; he is a velcro dog and never leaves my side. He’s generally pretty happy, but he lived in the mountains for the first couple of months of his life, so isn’t used to hanging out with other dogs. At dog parks, he doesn’t play with other dogs unless they approach him first. How can you socialize a nervous dog?\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nBeing a bit cautious isn’t necessarily a bad thing, says Kinship Collective member and dog trainerRobert Haussmann. But perhaps we can help improve his comfort level and willingness to engage other dogs. We also want to prevent him from becoming over-stressed and developing any fearful or reactive behaviors around other dogs.\nDogs go through adevelopmental stageknown as thecritical period— commonly referred to as the socialization period — between two and 14 weeks of age. During this time, dogs can develop familiarity with a variety of sights, sounds, other animals, people, and situations. It is their exposure during this crucial time that builds resilience and confidence around novelty. The more exposure, the more comfortable they become. Because Gator has spent much of his early socialization period in the mountains, he may not have developed his social chops with other dogs. This can leave him feeling unsure about inviting or accepting play and/or expressing his likes and dislikes and his ability to safely resolve conflict.\nAt six months of age, Gator is just startinghis teen years. Along with the awkwardness that befalls all teens, dogs also hit yet another developmental phase called the secondary fear period. The secondary fear period starts between six and eight months of age and lasts until about 18 months. This lesser-known and often overlooked stage of life coincides with the time when a dog would leave the care of his mother and venture off in the world. Nature, being as clever as she is, flips a little switch in the brain that says,Be careful, if you’re not 100 percent sure, stay back, and proceed with caution!\nWhat to expect when your perfect puppy hits that unruly stage.\nHaving a sheltered early socialization period followed by intense exposure during the secondary fear period can lead to anything from minor discomfort to severe fearfulness depending on the dog. Lucky for you, it sounds like Gator is more of the former and just feels a bit uncomfortable around other dogs. Here are some tips to help him go from wallflower to social butterfly.\nHow can I tell if my dog is shy or fearful?\nHere are some of the most common signs of an unsocialized dog:\nA fearful dog might have flattened ears, lick their lips, yawn, cower, avoid eye contact or tuck their tail between their legs when around strangers or other dogs\nA fearful dog might have flattened ears, lick their lips, yawn, cower, avoid eye contact or tuck their tail between their legs when around strangers or other dogs\nA shy dog might exhibit aggressive behavior, such as staring, erect ears, barking a lot, snarling, or growling and snapping when around strangers or other dogs\nA shy dog might exhibit aggressive behavior, such as staring, erect ears, barking a lot, snarling, or growling and snapping when around strangers or other dogs\nA shy or fearful dog might back up, raise their hackles, or exhibit aggressive behavior when on walks even if no one else is around.\nIf it’s time for a round of shots (no, not that kind), follow this guide.\nWhat is the best age to start socializing my shy dog?\nDogs go through a developmental stage known as the critical period — commonly referred to as the socialization period — between two and 14 weeks of age. During this time, dogs can develop familiarity with a variety of sights, sounds, other animals, people, and situations. It is their exposure during this crucial time that builds resilience and confidence around novelty. The more exposure, the more comfortable they become.\nHow do I start socializing my shy dog?\nDog parks,daycares, and playdates with other rowdy puppies may be a bit too much for Gator. Closed spaces with larger groups of dogs running around and playing can often be pretty overwhelming. To introduce a nervous dog to other dogs, try enlisting some friends or family members with dogs to go on walks together, moving in the same direction and having the chance to be near each other without a lot of face-to-face encounters right away. Allow both dogs to take their time and feel safe. They are seeing and smelling each other from a distance while roaming around together sniffing and exploring.\nAfter about 10 minutes of this, you can stop and see if they are interested in sniffing each other for a few seconds. Once they have given a sniff or two, walk-on for a bit longer, stopping occasionally to assess their comfort level and allow them to engage in prosocial behavior. They can then be encouraged to have a little outdoor off-leash play too. Building Gator’s social experience and exposure should accumulate into an overall sense of safety in the presence of dogs.\nSound advice from seasoned dog and cat parents who have been there.\nWhat are some socialization techniques for shy dogs?\nSome dogs play rough, some dogs play gently. Some dogs like to chase, some dogs like to wrestle. Others just want to play fetch and be left alone. When you’re trying to teach your dog to greet other dogs calmly, follow Gator’s lead on what kind of player he is and set him up with playmates and activities he enjoys. Perhaps the dog park on a Saturday morning is just too rowdy for him. Maybe the closest dog park is just not big enough for him to find a buffer to create space and assess the situation. Maybe he is more into an open field with a few good friends. If you find a group of dogs he gets on with, try and make it a regular thing. If you find a big open park where he can avoid rowdy dogs and find chiller playmates, go out of your way to take the trip — even if it means passing the park right down the block.\nTo help build confidence in your insecure or shy dog, engage in activities where Gator can feel capable and safe can help him in his day-to-day confidence. Try engaging in somescent games. Have him perform a down stay in one room while you hide his breakfast, a few kibbles here, a few kibbles there, then release him to go find it. If he eats wet or raw food this can be distributed in stuffable rubber toys and hidden in the same manner.\nSpeaking of stuffable toys, invest in a variety ofinteractive feeding toysthat he can engage with and dissect. This can be the primary way he eats his meals and any snacks outside of training. Having him search and forage for his own food is a great way to help him feel capable.\nA dog behaviorist schools us on why puppy classes are more about socializing than getting straight As.\nA well-rungroup training classcan be an organized way to train a timid dog by engaging with other dogs without play being the primary focus. Find a dog socialization training class with a professionally certified trainer who practices LIMA (Least Intrusive, Minimally Aversive) techniques and has plenty of experience. Learning a strong foundation of training cues is also a real confidence booster and opens up a clear line of communication and strong bond between you and Gator.\nWhat if my shy dog shows signs of distress during socialization?\nWhile it will be tempting to take him into thedog parkon a Saturday when everyone looks like they are having a good time, try to avoid putting him in situations where he may feel overwhelmed. You may even receive well-meaning advice to keep bringing him until he gets used to it. But this can have adverse effects on your progress, especially during this sensitive time in his development. Exposure to dogs is critical to getting him to feel more confident around them and therefore more social. Make sure to work slowly until he is ready and excited to go play.\nOnce Gator is more comfortable playing with dogs, it is still important to know when he has had enough or if he is feeling a bit overwhelmed. Familiarize yourself with canine body language and the subtle cues that indicate when he is and is not comfortable. Remember you are his teacher, guardian, and overall main squeeze. He depends on you for information and trusts you to make decisions that keep his best interests in mind.\nThere are no stupid questions — well, when it comes to your dog’s health.\nFAQs (People Also Ask):1) Should I force my shy dog into social situations?\nDefinitely not! Ease your shy dog into social situations by enlisting the help of some friends or family members with dogs to go on walks together.\nA well-rungroup training classrun by a certified trainer can be an organized way to train a timid dog by engaging with other dogs without play being the primary focus.\nIt really depends on the dog and why they are so shy - it can take anywhere from a few weeks to months.\nKeep track of what triggers your dog's fears and relay that to your vet so they can help you figure out if supplements or medications might help.\nReferences:\nAdams County Colorado Shy Dog Socialization\nAdams County Colorado Shy Dog Socialization\nGulf Coast K9 Dog Training How to Socialize a Scared Puppy\nGulf Coast K9 Dog Training How to Socialize a Scared Puppy\nPawderosa Ranch How to Socialize Adult Dogs, Aggressive Dogs and Shy Dogs\nPawderosa Ranch How to Socialize Adult Dogs, Aggressive Dogs and Shy Dogs\nPaws 4 U Socializing Your Dog\nPaws 4 U Socializing Your Dog\nRichmond SPCA Fearfulness Around Strangers\nRichmond SPCA Fearfulness Around Strangers\nCoastal Pet What to do if Your Dog Isn't Well Socialized\nCoastal Pet What to do if Your Dog Isn't Well Socialized",

  "page_content": "Living on a farm with dozens of dogs is the dream, right? You’d think so, but it can actually be a real a nightmare — at least for the dogs. In March of this year, 121 injured and malnourished dogs werefound in Ector County, Texas; some were feral and had seemingly never interacted with a human before.And earlier this July, a woman was prosecuted for hoarding three cats and 28 dogs in unsanitary conditions for years. “Many of them are on vet care,” Julie Larish, one of the animal rescuers on the case,told The Times Leader. “We have some severe anemia issues going on, but we are working on them. We had two that were near death with anemia. The vet said two more days they would have been dead.”\nHoarders have trouble parting with possessions because they feel like they need tosavethem. (We’ve all seen the reality show, right?) For animal hoarders, however, it’s not all about them. One rescue pup becomes two, then three — or a dozen if they aren’tspayed or neutered. Before they know it, their bleeding heart has caused the situation to spiral and they are up to their eyeballs in dogs and/or cats who they simply cannot feed or vet, not to mention train orsocialize.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nNew trends we can totally get behind.\nRescuing Dogs from Hoarding Cases is Just the Beginning\nWhen dogs are rescued from hoarding situations, understandably, the trauma can often stay with them for some time, and it can take them a while to figure out not just how to be a dog, but a pet too. For the adopter of one of these lucky pups, it can be heartbreaking to see them struggle to navigate their new world at first, though it’s ultimately a rewarding experience — especially when you see that first tail wag! But until recently, rescuers and trainers barely grasped how best to help these dogs recover.\nEnter: Dr. Frank McMillan, director of Well-Being Studies atBest Friends Animal Societyin Utah, and Dr. James Serpell, director of theCenter for the Interaction of Animals and Societyat the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. They have each dedicated their life’s work to understanding trauma in dogs, and a few years ago, they teamed up to study a specific group: those rescued from animal hoarders. Their research revealed these dogs’ unique needs, and in doing so, suggested how to address them.\nDr. McMillan had questions: What’s different in the behavior of dogs who have been abused? What about dogs who lived as breeding animals in puppy mills, or in a hoarding environment? And Dr. Serpell provided the means for finding answers: a validated questionnaire that the two researchers use to measure dogs’ behavior, and a massive database populated with information gleaned from 16,000 questionnaires filled out by dog parents from all over the world. This database allowed the researchers to compare the behaviors of the average dog to the behaviors of dogs from hoarding environments.\nFor starters:No, they’re not all traumatized andyes, youcanfind a purebred puppy at a shelter.\nBest Friends Animal Society contacted parents and foster parents of previously hoarded dogs and asked them to fill out questionnaires about their dogs’ behavior. A comparison of their responses to that of the “average” dog parent in Dr. Serpell’s database provided the first scientific insights into how these dogs behave.\nMeasuring the Trauma and Behavior of Hoarded Dogs\nMeasuring a dog’s personality is a difficult task, highlighted by the question of whether their behavior on the day it is measured has any relationship to their behavior on any other day. In other words, is a dog’s behavior at any given point in time actually a window into their personality? Dr. Serpell’s questionnaire, the Canine Behavioral Assessment & Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ), addresses this by asking the pet parent — the person who knows the dog best — to supply the information. The 100-item survey includes questions about the dog’s responses to specific situations, such as meeting unfamiliar dogs or visiting the veterinarian. Dr. Serpell’s team grouped the questions into related categories so that conclusions could be drawn about a dog’s general personality (e.g.excitabilityand train-ability) and behavior issues (e.g. stranger-directedaggressionanddog-directed aggression).\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nIn order for McMillan to be able to help potential adopters of hoarded dogs know what to expect, he needed to make comparisons. But this proved to be somewhat trickier — determining the ways in which these dogs’ behavior differed from the behavior of normal dogs first required a definition of “normal.” Whatisa normal dog? How likely is it that any dog will have aggression problems toward other dogs, and how much more likely is it that a dog from a hoarding situation will display aggression? To find out, Dr. Serpell queried the C-BARQ database, which — when compared toAmerican Veterinary Medical Associationsurveys — appears to provide a good representation of the variety of dogs living in U.S. homes.\nThe Unsurprising Results from the Study\nSome of the results of the comparison between the two groups of dogs were what the researchers expected. Dogs from hoarding environments were dramatically more likely to be fearful of people, other dogs, or just the world in general. (A terror of new things — and to them, everything is new — is one of the hallmarks of a dog from a hoarding situation.) Additionally, hoarded dogs have no opportunity to learn good house manners, and are more likely to go to the bathroom in the house when left alone than the comparison dogs. Many of these dogs also dislike being touched or restrained, but simultaneously show a deep neediness and desire to be near people.\nThese results paint a picture of a dog who is not equipped at a basic level to interact normally with the world, and who is desperate to relate to humans but is not quite sure how to go about it. Dr. Serpell wonders if these attachment disorders are due to the disruption of the normal environment early in the dogs’ lives, followed by an environment with little to no individual attention. “You take them out of that situation,” he says, “and it looks like they hyper-attach to the new owner.”\nIf they’re following you around like your shadow, there’s a reason for that.\nThe study also turned up an increased incidence of compulsive behaviors in dogs rescued from hoarding environments including spinning, pacing, or licking blankets, carpets, oreven themselves. These repetitive behaviors, known as stereotypies, also appear in animals kept captive in other restricted, barren environments such as shelters and zoos with sub-standard facilities. Stereotypies are thought to help animals deal with stress, and may remain even after the animal is in a less stressful environment.\nThe Surprises — Good Ones!\nSome of the results surprised the researchers, however. Although they suspected that many dogs in hoarding situations have had traumatic experiences with other dogs, the dogs in the hoarded group werelesslikely to display aggression towards strange dogs or dogs in their household than the comparison dogs were. As Dr. Serpell speculated, “You could imagine that in a hoarding household, where there are literally hundreds of dogs, any dog that engaged in dog rivalry is going to have a difficult time, so it kind of gets trained out of them. So they don’t show this type of behavior to the same extent as dogs living in, say, a two-dog household.”\nHe was also quite interested in finding that dogs from hoarding situations appeared less likely to engage in persistent barking than dogs in the comparison group, unless they are rehomed with other dogs. “Barking, we know, is something that’s socially facilitated. So when one dog barks, it tends to trigger other dogs barking. It may be that these dogs are subjected to such incessant barking because of the numbers of dogs [in the hoarding environment] that they may habituate to it, and they no longer respond,” Dr. Serpell hypothesized. “Interestingly, when you take them out of that situation, that habit of barking doesn’t come back unless they’re in a household with another dog, which triggers the behavior again.”\nYoucanlive in a quiet house again.\nMany of the behaviors — or lack of them — described in these dogs suggest an animal paralyzed by fear. It shows an animal who has developed learned helplessness and is reluctant to interact with the environment. In addition to decreased aggression, the caretakers of these dogs report decreased trainability, presumably because the dogs avoid interaction. One respondent reported that if something like a baby gate fell on her foster dog, “He would not even move out from under it, but would lie there passively.”\nWhat This All Means\nBecause dogs are individuals, both Dr. Serpell and Dr. McMillan caution against over-interpretation of their results. The trauma of living in a hoard isn’t the same for any two dogs. “As part of a slide show, I present one case example of six dogs who came from the exact same facility, who show a huge variation in everything from fear levels to bonding with people,” Dr. McMillan says. The trends in the study are clear, but there are only two of them. Despite evidence that dogs with this background may be more likely to display specific behaviors, there’s no guarantee that every dog from a hoarding situation will. Especially given that, while they’re in the minority, some dogs come out of a hoard with their natural friendliness and sociability intact.\nBoth Dr. McMillan and Dr. Serpell lamented the lack of complete histories for these dogs. Many are born into hoarding situations, and may grow up without being socialized to humans. If the hoarder was a woman, they may have never seen a male human before their rescue. Others are brought into the hoard as adults, perhaps as part of a dog sanctuary gone tragically wrong. These dogs may have received normal socialization and even training, and therefor may be more able to adapt to life outside the hoard than one who has never known any other life. Whatever the circumstance, all information on origins is typically lost once a dog enters a hoard and the C-BARQ has no way of determining if a particular dog’s resilience is due to an early life in a healthier environment, some minimal amount of socialization within the hoarding environment, genetics, or simply chance.\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nSo, Is Canine PTSD Real?\nDr. McMillan remarked on how the individuality of each dog’s response mirrored the varied responses of humans to trauma. When asked if he felt that these dogs suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), he said that some of the aspects fit the criteria used to diagnose PTSD in people, “but not exact enough to where we can call it that… Part of the PTSD diagnosis involves things going on cognitively that we can’t delve into with dogs, such as intrusive memories, flashbacks, nightmares, that kind of a thing. So I hesitate to give that label to any of this.” He added that adopters of hoarded dogs frequently report that the dogs have what appear to be nightmares. In a follow-up to the original survey, he asked these adopters what human diagnosis they felt best fit their dogs and more than half of them listed PTSD.\nIn that follow-up survey, Dr. McMillan also asked adopters about their experiences with these dogs and received responses from 296 participants. This survey had no comparison group of “normal” dogs and the adopters who chose to answer may have had more positive experiences with their particular dogs. Nevertheless, their responses were enlightening.\nPatience and Positive Reinforcement are Key\nThey describe dogs who lack trust in the world, ones so fearful of being in a cage that they nearly stop breathing when kenneled at a veterinarian’s, who enter long fugues of licking the ground or a carpet. But the same dogs are also described as providing deep delight to their pet parents that cherish every tiny step forward. These dogs can bond very closely — the terrified animal visitors see is not the same as the loving dog the pet parent sees. Most importantly, the respondents spoke about dramatic improvements. Many of these dogs will never be functionally normal, but over years of living in a healthy environment, their behavior has changed dramatically.\nFrom exercise needs to medical history to compatibility with kids, here is everything you need to know.\nWhile more than two-thirds of respondents said they felt their dogs still had improvements to make in their behavior, they reported that they had already seen great advances in the dogs’ level of happiness and quality of life. As one wrote, “She is truly a happy, happy little soul when she is inside of her comfort zone.” Tellingly, 93 percent wrote that they would be willing to adopt this same dog again, even knowing what they now know about their behavior.\nDr. McMillan cautions against pushing these dogs too hard. For any fearful animal, but particularly ones from hoarding cases, punishment may result in a setback. Adopters report that even strong words may be too much. The treatment that helped most was patience. Adopter after adopter wrote about learning to let the dog take each new step at their own pace. Pushing them before they were ready could result in increased fear. But giving the dog time to slowly learn that the world isn’t so scary reaped enormous benefits.\nOther strategies included avoiding eye contact, which helped them gain confidence. For dogs who were afraid of hands, reinforcement withtreats(tossed, not handed to the dog), rather than petting, was helpful. Some also benefited hugely from living with another, well-socialized dog who could show them the ropes and demonstrate how to be affectionate with humans. As some dogs came out of their shells, they responded well to positive reinforcement training in classes likeagility, obedience, andnosework.\nIt’s a big decision, so check these boxes before you sign on the dotted line.\nMore Support Needed\nRegrettably, those who adopted dogs from hoarding situations reported having difficulty finding support helping their dogs adjust. Though many trainers refer to themselves as behaviorists, for a dog with severe behavior problems such as the ones exhibited by many of these hoarded dogs, pet parents would do well to seek out professionals with advanced behavior training. Because many hoarded dogs display deep-seated fear for whichmedicationcan be helpful, a veterinary behaviorist who can prescribe medication may also be particularly helpful.\nDr. McMillan is doing his best to provide information about what to expect from hoarded dogs and how to treat them. He published a manual, “Understanding and Caring for Rescued Hoarded Dogs,” that includes insights and quotes from the follow-up survey, as well as statistics, and Dr. McMillan’s own interpretations of what he found.\nDr. McMillan and Dr. Serpell believe that their study is the first to describe the behavior of dogs — or, in fact, any species — rescued from a hoarding environment. Ideally, more studies will follow, as we still don’t know enough about these dogs and how to help them. The hoarding environment is a difficult one to study, as alien to a healthy household as Antarctica is to Florida. Those who adopt these dogs need to be able to make informed choices about treatment strategies. Trying to adjust to the new and strange world of being a human’s companion must seem an almost insurmountable task to a once-hoarded dog. These dogs, and those who take them in, deserve our help.",

  "page_content": "We found Gus on Craigslist, back when you could peddle living things alongside couches and hubcaps on the classifieds site. People were moving and couldn’t take him with them. He was six months old and all head. But what a cute, giant head it was, with spiky white hair and the deepest, darkest eyes that reached right through my iBook screen and into my heart. Chris, my boyfriend (now husband), was on a work trip in LA at the time, but one look at that picture, and he was sold. Which, now that I think about it, was crazy, considering we hadn’ttechnicallymoved in together yet and hadn’treallydiscussed the fact that getting a dog together was a big commitment.\nChris and I both grew up with dogs — I had a Golden Retriever, Shandy, and a Westie, Falafel; he had a Bulldog, Molly. We were used to having them around, but we had never raised one on our own and certainly hadn’t considered what it would be like having one in a small New York City apartment. I have no recollection of my mompotty trainingFalafel or teaching Shandy to heel.

How can our dogs cope?\nThe Learning Curve With Gus\nOne week with Gus, and we knew we had our work cut out for us. Yes, the potty training was all encompassing and the early jump-on-the-bed-and-take-me-for-a-walk-right-this-second wakeups took some getting used to. But that was nothing compared to what we dealt with when we left Gus alone. Puppies, we soon learned, often suffer fromseparation anxiety— especially a puppy like Gus, whose life had been uprooted and who suddenly had completely different owners, owners who issued commands in a different language and who gave him a new name. (We couldn’t let him go by Snowball — he would have been bullied at the dog run!).\nChris worked from home, so the separation anxiety didn’t present itself for a few days. But the first time we left him alone for a night out, we came home to find that he had ripped the internet cable cords out of the wall by the front door (possibly trying to dig his way out?). The second time, I found a leather scrap trail leading to the tattered remains of my new sandals. The third? A complaint from our neighbor that a terrifying wailing was keeping her up. But Gus didn’t cry, we protested! To prove ourselves right, the next time we went out, we turned on a tape recorder.\nIt was a trick question. A study shows that the pandemic has made us all codependent.\nWhen we pushed play, we were shocked — horrified, really — by what we heard. First, pacing. Then scratching and whimpering at the door. Then a full-throated bellow that crescendoed into a gurgling cough-sob. It was heartbreaking (and, I’ll admit, also hilarious — who knew a dog could make such a sound?). What’s more is that this unnatural, tortured yowl filled the whole tape. For two hours. We had to do something.\nHow to Overcome the Separation Anxiety Hurdle\nDog Training For Dummiesby Wendy Volhard andMary Ann Rombold-Zeigenfuseand Paul Loeb’sSmarter Than You Thinkbecame our new Bibles. We put our social life on a pause for a few weeks and only left him alone for brief moments (two minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes…) so we could return before his anxiety set in. We tried to limit our ‘pre-departure cues’ by wearing our shoes around the house. We bought a Kong and filled it with peanut butter and only let him have it when we went out. I remember tossing it like a grenade and running for the door.\nIt all was going really well until he somehow opened the kitchen cabinet with all the cleaning supplies and ingested a heaping helping of Ajax and had to have his stomach pumped. That was fun. But eventually, things started to get easier, and we could leave the apartment without worrying about what we’d come back to (yes, we bought a child-proof lock for that cabinet). He learned to trust us and, I think on some level, knew we’d always return. Although I’m sure that if a total stranger came in he would have welcomed them with open paws: “Thank God you’re here! They left me all alone! I thought I was going to die!”\nWe asked both animal behaviorists and human psychologists howyoucan deal with leaving your dog home alone.\nOne thing Gus never outgrew? Giving us the biggest, butt-wiggling, kiss-filled welcome home ever — whether we were out for four hours or four minutes.

My husband and I experienced this firsthand with our dog,Brie. Despite our best attempts atcrate trainingher after adopting her in 2020, Brie exhibited severe signs of distress whenever we left her home alone. Think: shaking, whimpering, crying, and barking.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nIn all other areas, Brie was awell-adjusted puppy. She was friendly with other dogs, loved people, and quickly masteredpotty trainingand basic commands. With one or both of us at home, she roamed happily, napping by herself in other rooms. But when we tried to leave the house — even for a few minutes — her response was the same:utter panic.\nLike most things in 2023, there’s a Zoom link for this.\nThree years and countless hours of training later, we’ve made some progress, but leaving her home alone is still a struggle. She is extremely attached to us, andwe are attached to her. The experience has led me to wonder: How are all the other pandemic pets doing? Below, a few pet parents who give us the update on how their 2020-era pets are doing in 2023.\nThriving…Mostly\nAllison, who lives in Brooklyn, rescued her dog, Oliver, in January 2021 throughBideawee, an animal rescue organization. It was love at first sight when the pair met, and Oliver adapted quickly to his new home. A dog park across the street from Allison’s apartment provided ample opportunities for socializing, and a trainer came to meet them outdoors to work onleash training. Life was good.\nAllison worked remotely until February 2022, when she had toresume going into her officethree days a week. Although she trusted Oliver to stay alone in the living room, she set up acamerato keep an eye on him.\n“At first, when I would leave the apartment, I would hear him crying,” Allison recalls. “I would obsessively check the camera all day, and he would just be sitting by the door. He seemed kind of sad, which made me sad.”\n“Somebody’s Watching Me” will be their new favorite karaoke song.\nEventually, she noticed a shift in his attitude. “All of a sudden, I felt like he became a teenager. I checked the camera one day and found him sitting on the living room table!” Mom wasn’t home, and he was making the most of it.\nAllison acknowledges that the adjustment from being together 24/7 to spending time apart may have been harder for her than Oliver, sharing that she still struggles when she leaves him. On a recent work trip to Europe, she visited several dog-friendly businesses and found herself missing him. “I definitely have separation anxiety,” she admits. (Same.)\nToday, Oliver is thriving…mostly. Allison and her boyfriend live together now, and he still works remotely, so Oliver has company during his days again. The couple started traveling with Oliver at a young age, and he is well-trained and happy when theybring him on vacation.\nStill, when Allison has to leave on business trips, her boyfriend reports that Oliver seems especially stressed and needy. And when heiswith Allison, he occasionally growls or barks at other dogs and people that try to approach them. “I’m not sure if it’s pandemic related or not, but he is very protective of me and can be wary of people,” she says.\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for dealing with a protective dog that’s taken their duties too far.\nStill Adapting\nWhen Catherine adopted her puppy, Finn, in Los Angeles, COVID-19 vaccinations were still a few months away, and most of the city was still sheltering in place.\n“It was February 2021, so we spent most of our time indoors,” she recalls. Because of this, Finn learned to do his business on pee pads inside her apartment. While he was an affectionate and sweet puppy, he spent most of his formative months inside with Catherine and was reluctant to play with other pups when they visited thedog park. Fast forward two years, and Finn is still uncomfortable with the great outdoors.Catherine says it’s a struggle to get him towalk on a leash, and he still hasn’t grasped the concept of going to the bathroom outdoors. “I’ll take him on a two-hour walk, and he won’t do anything. The second we walk into the house, he runs straight to hispee padsand does his business.” When she removes the pee pads all together, he has accidents in the middle of her living room.\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\n“I do wonder if we would have had this issue had I not gotten him in the middle of a pandemic,” Catherine admits. Despite her frustrations, she says she would not trade a second with Finn, recalling how much joy he brought her during those lonely months of quarantine. They are currently working with a trainer who is optimistic about Finn’s progress.\nSocial Butterfly\nLike many young adults, Eric moved back home with his parents at the start of the pandemic. His childhood dog, then 15, kept him company during the early days of COVID-19. But in March 2021, his dog passed away.\n“After he passed I needed some time to heal and grieve,” Eric recalls. “I was really hesitant to get another pet because I was scared of losing another one.” Eventually, Eric realized how deeply he missed having the presence of a pet in his life. In September 2021, he brought home Banjo, a three month old Schnauzer mix.\nEric was extremely cautious about exposure to COVID-19, especially living in New York City, but having Banjo helped him to mellow out, especially once he’d received his first vaccine dose. “I will never have the mentality that the pandemic is completely over,” Eric says. “It’s just something that exists now. But as the general energy in the city became more relaxed, I knew I needed to lean into that for Banjo’s own development and let him say ‘hi’ to other dogs.”\nNew kid on the block? Follow this trainer’s tips before letting your pet run wild.\nEric quickly discovered he had a social pup on his hands. Banjo was immediately enthusiastic and friendly around both people and animals and was happiest on long walks. Today, he is happiest when playing with dogs he encounters on his romps around NYC.\nGiven his pack mentality, leaving Banjo home alone proved to be initially challenging. “I was working remotely when Banjo was a puppy so I was home with him all the time for the first few months,” Eric says. When he began graduate school the following year, Eric started attending in-person classes three days a week and leaving Banjo home alone for a few hours at a time.\n“I would definitely hear him whining or barking from the hallway whenever I left the apartment,” Eric recalls. The initial separation was difficult for both Eric and Banjo, so Eric set up a camera that allowed him to check in on his BFF when he was out.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\n“I noticed that by the time I got off the elevator and checked the camera from outside, he was already lying down and not crying anymore.” This insight into Banjo’s self-soothing process helped mitigate some of the guilt Eric felt over leaving him. He still thinks Banjo has a touch of separation anxiety, but they have both gotten a lot better at calming themselves down when they are apart.\nIn general, Eric isn’t sure that the pandemic had an impact on Banjo’s disposition. “I think the role it played was minor, if anything,” he says. “Maybe we would have started leaving him home alone sooner if life was normal, but I think his personality type would still have been social and that he still would whine when left alone.”\nThe Kids Are All Right\nOverall, despite an increase in separation anxiety for all parties,the kids, aka, our pandemic pets, are all right. Most of them are happiest when reunited with their humans, but what pet isn’t? For my part, I’m going to keep working on empowering Brie to be her most independent self. And if extra cuddles are our biggest consequence in the meantime, I’ll take them.",

  "page_content": "One of the rare positives of the pandemic was that working from home really meant working with pets. No more saying goodbye in the morning and coming home at the end of the day. Now we were together 24/7. There were lots of new pets, too, as humans had more  time and presence to take on animal companions. Now it’s 2023, and your work probably has you coming back to the office at least a few times a week, if not every day. But how has your dog been handling that?The last three years were filled with new routines and more bonding time because those work from home schedules were flexible. But now that most of us have returned to the office, this shift can be both confusing and stressful for our pets. Your dogs don’t understand that your boss is requiring you to come in and really don’t get why you aren’t going to be snuggling during your lunch hour.Before you get too worried about all this, let’s go over a few things we can do to help set our pets up for success while you’re away all day.\nIt was a trick question. A study shows that the pandemic has made us all codependent.\nEstablish a Routine\nFirst off, pets love exactly that: routine. Start to get your pet settled on your new weekday timeline. Answer these questions: What time will you be getting up in the morning? What time will your pets be eating their breakfast? How about dinner? When and where do the walks fit in? If you can make the switch to the new normal schedule while you’re still working from home, you’ll have a smoother transition. This way, from your dog’s point of view, most things won’t change at all when you go back to commuter life.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nKeep Things Calm\nPets can be very sensitive to your getting-ready-for work rituals, if you can call rushing around the house looking for your phone, keys, etc. a ritual. But this can cause as much anxiety in your pets as it does in you. Again, the key is to normalize and relax and not always associate these things with leaving for the day. So. pick up your keys and walk around the house. Put your coat on and then sit on the sofa. Grab your backpack and go back to the kitchen. This will decrease the anxiety your pet feels when he sees you’re leaving.\nTips on hiring a trusted dog walker for your dog.\nKeep Their Brains Working\nMake the pre-work mornings about mental enrichment. You’ve probably heard dog trainers talk about the benefits of keeping your dog’s brain engaged. Mental stimulation helps a dog decompress and burn off excess energy. By the time you leave for the office, your dog will be ready for a good long nap. Kongs and lick mats encourage licking and chewing, which are activities that reduce stress and anxiety (do they make Kongs for humans?). Fill a Kong with peanut butter or favorite treats at night,put it in the freezerand give it to your dog in the morning to help them de-stress before you hit the road.\nTake Care of Yourself, Too\nNow we need to talk aboutyourseparation anxiety. You’ll be at work and mildly freaked out over not knowing what your dog is doing. If you’re a worrier or just someone who likes to see their dog, you can set up a pet camera for remote viewing. I have a pet camera in my house that alerts me to my dogs’ barking and activity. You’ll be able to see for yourself if your dog is barking and pacing, which are signs of stress or do they just sleep all day?\nWho will love your dog like their own (for 30 minutes per day).\nGet a Dog Walker\nIf you think your dog needs a potty break in the day or if they need more exercise or company, consider a dog walker or day care. It’s a good idea to have a dog walker come a few times a week, especially if your work days are really long or unpredictable. Just remember that it is an adjustment and it will take some time. If slowly let your pet (and yourself) get used to your return to 9-5, you’ll both be set up for success.",

    "title": "8 Calming Products That Help My Dog’s Anxiety",

  },
  "page_content": "Editor’s Note: Even if your pup doesn’t normally suffer from separation anxiety, Fourth of July fireworks can traumatize the most cool, calm, and collected of dogs.Noise sensitivitycan affect their mental and physical well-being—these effective calming products will allow you to enjoy the holiday and have peace of mind that your pet is safe and sound at home.\nWhen I adopted my toothless Dachshund, Moose, I thought I was prepared for anything. I set up a pee pad on my balcony, got plenty of gum-friendly toys and treats, and already loved him unconditionally. But nothing could prepare me for my biggest hurdle upon adopting him:separation anxiety.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nIf left by himself for even a minute Moose would bark, scream, and claw at his crate. Neighbors complained, my roommate fled to her parent’s house, and I was chained to my home for months until we were able to figure out a solution. A year later, I’m happy to report that Moose and I are making major progress with his separation anxiety. I tried every product out there marketed for the condition, so I compiled a list of whatactuallyhelped him—and can hopefully help you too. Here are the eight best calming aid for dogs with separation anxiety.\nBtw, our editors (and their pets) picked out these products. They’re always in stock at the time we publish, but there’s a chance they’ll sell out. If you do buy through our links, we may earn a commission. (We’ve got a lot of toys to buy over here, you know?)\nLeaving your dog with a high-reward treat is often the first thing experts recommend for separation anxiety training. The theory is that a high-reward treat while you’re gone will associate something positive with what is currently a negative experience. Unfortunately, Moose’s anxiety was so extreme that he was far too nervous to even touch the Kong while I was gone. This isn’t uncommon for a dog with intense separation anxiety — especially if they are more praise/people motivated than they are food motivated. This might be a better option for a dog who is more food motivated or has less separation anxiety.\nEven though the Kong was a bust, I decided a lick mat might be a better solution after reading that licking is a calming activity for dogs. It worked for about 30 seconds more than the Kong (which is to say it worked for 30 seconds).\nEarly on in this training, I realized I would have to get creative. Enter Snuggle Puppy, a stuffed dog that comes with a heat pack and heartbeat accessory designed to calm your dog with companionship. Moose loved it — as a chew toy (or a gum toy, in his case). It quickly went to our toy pile — but did nothing to help his separation anxiety.\nThe Thundershirt was a game-changer for us in this training. Outside of being left alone, the Thundershirt did a great job of calming Moose down by using compression and pressure to simulate being held or hugged. When left alone, the shirt by itself wasn’t as effective – but combined with other products and techniques it soon became a large part of our training.\nThis diffuser contains a liquid that mimics the pheromones mother dogs emit after giving birth, which is intended to calm her new puppies. The pheromone is marketed as odorless, but does give off a faint rubbing alcohol scent that didn’t really bother me. I was happy enough that it seemed to work and did a fair job of calming Moose both in and out of his crate. However, like the Thundershirt, the pheromones on their own weren’t enough to keep Moose relaxed — but in combination with our other training, they became an important weapon in our arsenal against separation anxiety.\nCBD disbelievers be gone because this ish really works. Like with human CBD, dog CBD is incredibly brand dependent but Super Snouts was a lifesaver for me and Moose. It’s important to note that this CBD does NOT contain any THC or psychoactive components. It’s completely dog safe and is incredibly effective at relaxing even the most stressed pups. The biggest problem we faced was a tolerance issue. After a week or so, Moose started needing more and more CBD to reach the same relaxed state and, after a while, it became completely ineffective.\nWe still use it from time to time — but I’m more careful at how often I’m dosing it out in order to maintain its effectiveness. If your dog’s separation anxiety is related to a temporary change perhaps this can be a more one-and-done solution. Otherwise, it’s still a great tool for relaxing your dog in stressful situations, if used sparingly.\nWhen I first started this training I had gotten mixed suggestions on where to leave Moose to allow him to feel most calm. Some said that acratewould be too claustrophobic, others said that allowing him to wander would make him feel too uncontained. We ended up trying three different methods: a five-foot widepen, acrate, and a room with a closed door. Left to his devices in the closed room, I watched on camera as Moose parkoured off of every piece of furniture I owned — leaving behind nervous accidents on many of them.\nEven scarier was leaving him in the pen, where Moose, a very short dog, would attempt to leap over the gate, sometimes getting his belly stuck on the pen before falling to the ground. In the end, the crate is where both Moose and I felt he was safest and calmest. A little trick that helped us even more was leaving Moose in the crate for 40 minutes before I left the house — allowing him to calm himself while I was still there.\nAdmittedly, Moose was a tough separation anxiety case. He had just been through the major trauma of losing his home (and all his teeth!). Early on, I consulted with his vet about how to best help him adjust, and we decided that anas-neededTrazodone prescription would allow Moose to stay calm while alone in his crate — allowing him to absorb the tools he needed to get over his separation anxiety once and for all.\nThe medication has allowed Moose to slowly gain confidence, while not affecting his personality or quality of life. If you’re struggling with your dog’s separation anxiety and feel like they might need more help than anything over the counter can give them, don’t hesitate to consult your vet to see if prescription anti-anxiety medication (used only when necessary) can give your dog some peace and you some peace of mind.",

  "page_content": "If your dog gets upset when you have people over, you’re not alone. I get calls every week from people who want help with dogs whoreact badlyto anyone who comes into the house. More often than not, these dogs are afraid — but people rarely call to say that they have afearful dog.They call to tell me that their dogs are aggressive towards visitors bybarking, lunging,growling, or evenbitingpeople.\nComprehensivedog training programsfor improving a dog’s emotional state and behavior when visitors arrive must be individually designed for each dog and each situation. Often, the use oftreatsor favorite toys is involved so that the dog learns that all visitors have something fun and wonderful to offer. When a dog has grasped the strong connection between visitors and good things, happiness can replace fear as the dog’s response to people coming to the house. That’s a very brief and simplified description of what can often be a long and detailed process. Sometimes one simple trick can help. Keep reading to learn what it is and how to try it.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nExpert advice for people with dogs who jump, bark, and generally go nuts when people come over.\nHow to Help a Fearful Dog Handle Visitors\nThe trick is to make sure your dog doesn’t see the visitors when they enter. Instead, you want your dog to encounter the guest when they are already settled in the house. It’s a lot easier for a dog to see people already seated in the living room or around the table than it is for them to see people arrive and enter. Having visitors show up at the door is a very intense situation for a fearful dog. The sight, smell, and sound of someone other than a family member appearing at the door and entering the home is a big deal to a dog who is not comfortable with new people. It sets off all of their alarm bells (“Intruder!”).\nTo avoid that, tell your visitors to call or text right before coming in so you can make sure you have the situation set up to maximize your chances of success. Before opening the door for your visitors, temporarily put your dog in a place out of sight of the entry, such as in acratein another room, in the backyard, or in the laundry room. I’ve even had clients briefly put their dog in the car in the garage if that is where the dog is most comfortable when not with their humans.\nYoucanlive in a quiet house again.\nOnce your dog is where you want them, let your visitors in, have them sit down, and give them whatever treats or toys your dog loves best. Then, bring your dog into the room and have them give your dog the goodies. Depending on the details of the dog’s issues, you may need to have your dog on aleashor behind a gate during this interaction.\nSome dogs will be fine with people once they have met them in this way, and if that’s the case, then this may be all you have to do during this particular visit. Other dogs may react poorly if anyone stands up or makes any sudden movements, so it may be better to keep them separate from your visitors after the initial exposure. Such dogs can benefit from additional work, but this technique can still be a good first step.\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\nNo single method suits every dog, and extra caution is always advisable with dogs who have bitten someone. Still, it is easier for almost all fearful dogs to meet visitors who are already in the house sitting down than it is to meet people as they enter the house. It will take time and patience for your dog to learn this skill. Like everything with dog training, there is no quick fix. But, with the help of a friend or two, a handful of treats, and a little patience, you can help ease your dog’s fear of household visitors.",

  "page_content": "His collar may read “Zen,” but don’t let the name fool you. WhenLetizia Silvestriadopted her then-6-month-old Terrier, he was far from it.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\n“I remember the shelter said, ‘He’s a very special dog, and he has a lot of aggression issues. Are you sure you want to adopt him?’” Silvestri tells Kinship. But she decided to take the leap. After all, it was the height of the pandemic, she was looking for a companion, and her work as a corporate event planner had stalled, so she had plenty of time on her hands.\nAlthough Silvestri had experience training dogs, Zen ended up being even more difficult than she’d anticipated. “He wasjumping all over, scratching,biting— he was completely out of control,” she says. “I remember I couldn’t even put my hands close to his face because he would start peeing on himself. He was so scared.”\nZen was on high alert at all hours of the day and night, and Silvestri worried that the lack of sleep was making his problems worse. She tried every trick in the book to calm him down:Positive reinforcement training, tiring him out during the day, giving him plenty oftreats— none of it seemed to make a dent in hisanxiety issues. When she consulted with dog behaviorists and trainers, they told her she might want to think aboutmedicating him, giving him away, or even putting him down.\nDesperate for a new approach, she considered what helped her during times of high stress that might help little Zen, too. The answer came in the form of a singing bowl. Yes, you read that right. Stay with us.\nSpurring Healing Through Sound\nWhen Silvestri started playing the small instrument, a fixture of sound healing, to Zen, something changed. “He started licking me, relaxing, and the best thing is he started sleeping during the day. We were building that trust,” she remembers of those early sessions.\nShe then signed up for classes to learn more about the science of what was going on in Zen’s restless mind: During sound healing, also called sound bathing or sound meditation, instruments that emit deep, low, reverberating tones are played to facilitate shifts in brainwave activity. The thinking is that the unique frequencies of gongs, singing bowls, and tuning forks can guide the listener out of fight-or-flight mode and into a more relaxed brain state, sometimes even putting them to sleep. While there hasn’t been all that much research on sound healing, one study found that adults reported feeling significantlyless tension, fatigue, and angerafter sitting through a singing bowl session, while another ruled sound meditation to be just as effective as silent meditation forturning around a bad mood.\nWhile the nervous systems of dogs don’t directly match up to those of humans, Silvestri walked away from her training thinking that this ancient practice could help animals find calm, too. And from there, her company,Altha, was born.\nHolistic Ways to Help Your Dog Chill\nAltha facilitates sound healing for humans and pups, sometimes alongside other mind-body practices, such as hypnosis, movement,yoga, and meditation. While a typical sound bath session lasts 60 to 90 minutes and features a lineup of instruments from drums to gongs to tuning forks, Silvestri adjusts the experience for dogs to avoid any potential sound triggers. (Most dogs don’t love rain sticks, for example.)\nWhen she plays for pups — either in private sessions or in small group environments — she says they tend to be curious at first; perking up with the whir of a bowl or the ding of a fork. But after a few minutes, she watches their ears fall and their bodies chill out. Often, they’ll curl up in a ball and fall asleep despite the distractions. Their eyes become very heavy. They might snore. Later, Silvestri hears from the pups’ parents that they are noticeably more relaxed and less on edge, as if the serene sounds are still reverberating through their paws.\nIn the future, Silvestri has plans to roll out her calming service in shelters to help anxious dogs near and far. She also hopes to hold more sound baths for four-legged companions and their humans who could use some healing. Dog parents in Los Angeles can stop by one of her sound sessions or pay a visit toDen Urban Dog Retreat, a dog spa that also hosts sound baths on occasion.\nAs for the rest of us? Here are a few other mental health exercises you can try at home to lead to one seriously zen dog:\nTappingis the practice of applying pressure to certain parts of the body, while saying positive mantras, in order to release tension. It’s something that Silvestri picked up from another holistic healer, so you might want to work with a professional to figure out exactly where your pup’s soft spots are.\nOK, your dog might not be able to sit still for your entire loving-kindness meditation, but Silvestri still sees value in hitting the mat together or at least staying in the same room during your meditation. “Dogs are very, very connected to us, and so sometimes they tend to absorb our energy,” she observes. So when you take the time to find peace and quiet, you might just be giving your pup permission to do the same.\nWhile you won’t become a renowned sound healer overnight, Silvestri notes that learning the basics of singing bowls — the first instrument she used with Zen during the pandemic — is pretty straightforward. Plus, there are plenty of YouTube tutorials you can access.\nYou can also bring soothing sounds to your living room by playing your pup anonline sound bath recording. While the vibrations of live sound healing sessions are unmatched, these recordings can be a helpful stand-in in a pinch. These days, Silvestri will play Zen five to 10 minutes of sounds every morning after they meditate together. While he still has the feisty energy of a Terrier, she finds that this sound session is enough to make Zen truly live up to his name. “He’s the sweetest dog ever,” she says. “And he’s truly transformed.”",

  },
  "page_content": "As someone prone to verbal blunders, I’m intimately familiar with the concept of an awkward introduction. But rather than just general weirdness after nervously saying the exact wrong thing, ill-advised greetings can have serious lingering effects on dogs. This is especially true for one of the most common meeting setups — face-to-face on leash.\n“I strongly suggest people don’t have on-leash greetings,” warns Charlie DiBono, trainer and founder ofBody and Mind K9in Long Beach, California. He explains that leashes are one of the best tools for communicating with our dogs, and when we introduce them to other pets while on one, it can jeopardize that connection. Not to mention, devaluing any obedience training they’ve had. This is because when our pup sees another dog, and we allow them to meet, we tend to tighten the leash. But that translates to the dog that we are nervous and, therefore, they should be, too. This communication can result in increased anxiety or a fight, which is the likely outcome.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nThere’s a lot more to it than sniffing each other’s butts.\nThe Problem With On-Leash Greetings\n“When meeting on-leash, dogs are coming at each other head-on. In the dog world, this means ‘I am a threat.’ It is natural for the dogs to feel defensive and react accordingly,” DiBono says. Even if an interaction is entirely positive on the surface and both dogs are cordial and calm, it can still cause problems almost immediately. After a lovely meet-and-greet, your pup will now want to say hello to every other dog they see. And if you don’t oblige, they may get frustrated and resort to leash reactivity or pulling.\nThe impetus of these risks for dogs on leashes is the same reason I stay off Tinder — it’s an unnatural way of meeting. “Dogs naturally greet each other bysniffingeach other’s rear ends and circling around each other. They typically approach in an arc rather than a straight line in an effort to show they are not a threat. This behavior is difficult to replicate while on a leash and the tension from the leash can cause reactivity in dogs, leading to aggression or fear,” DiBono explains.\nIf your pup acts diabolical on walks, you are not alone. Here’s what you can do.\nHow On-Leash Greetings Affect Your Dog in the Long-Term\nThere are far-reaching,  lingering effects of putting dogs in these types of situations. Not only will your dog potentially develop anxiety about going outside and seeing other dogs or leash-reactivity issues, but they may also lose trust in you. This can diminish your authority in communication and make training much more difficult. DiBono adds: “When the relationship between the owner and dog becomes untrustworthy, the dog begins to think they can ignore their owner and always run up to other dogs or that they can’t trust the owner to protect their boundaries.”\nDiBono explains that the ideal scenario for two dogs to meet is in a neutral and controlled environment with both animals off-leash. This can be a fenced-in yard or any enclosed space. Inviting a professional trainer to oversee the introduction, especially if the pets are unfamiliar with each other, would also be immensely helpful. Additionally, avoiding places with high stimuli, like busy parks or crowded streets, will help minimize adverse reactions. It’s also good to schedule the meetup around a time that is not mealtime or near favorite toys that dogs may feel protective over.\nKeep you and your dog safe in case of a dog fight emergency.\nHow to Make Your On-Leash Greeting Less Risky\nIf you must introduce your dog on a leash, there is a way to limit the negative consequences. DiBono recommends first walking with both dogs parallel to one another, allowing one to fall behind and sniff the other, then vice versa. After a hopefully encouraging initial meeting, he suggests going to a large enclosed space. You can then drop your leash, but DiBonos adds to not remove the leash from the dog’s collar in the event that you must intervene.\nMore than anything, if you’re out on a walk understand that you have no obligation to anyone or anyone’s dog except your own. “I would avoid all strange dogs,” DiBono says. “Your dog has no need to say hello and both dogs will be safer for it. If you take your dog in public, often it’s up to you to advocate for them and not allow others to rush them. Stick to dogs whose temperament and owners you are familiar with.”",

After you unclench your fists from the memory of someone trying to force you to deep-breathe your way out of a panic attack, read on about some very real science that can help your dog chill when they are feeling amped or anxious.\nOK, ready? Great.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nYour dog may spend most of their time snoozing away on the couch or gleefully getting outzoomies, but there will likely be times when they feel anxious or afraid. Some dogs may experience chronic anxiety or severe bouts of stress when they’releft aloneorduring a summer storm. Dog Appeasing Pheromones, or “DAP,” can help.\nWhat are Dog-Appeasing Pheromones?\nAccording to Dr. Valli Parthasarathy, DAP replicates the pheromone — or chemical messenger — that a mother dog secretes from her sebaceous glands when she is nursing, which has a relaxing and comforting effect on her puppies. Products that use DAP replicate this calming effect, and multiple studies have shown its impact, includingthis onethat showed the use of DAP may improve the recovery of shelter dogs who undergospay or neuter surgery.\nCompression vests, interactive toys, and pheromone sprays will be game-changers this Fourth of July.\nWhat Conditions Can DAP Help With?\nAdaptil is the most common product on the market. It comes in a variety of forms including collars, plug-in diffusers, and sprays. In Dr. Parthasarathy’s experience, dogs who are experiencing anxiety seem to benefit most from DAP, versus those struggling with things like basic obedience skills. Dogs withseparation anxiety, noise phobias like thunderstorms, and puppies or dogsadjusting to a new homeare the most common patients to benefit from DAP.\nDo DAP Really Work?\nAt Dr. Parthasarathy’s private practice in Oregon, about 50 percent of anxious dogs see an improvement after using DAP products. Pheromone treatment is very unlikely to cause any harm, so it’s easily paired with a more robust behavior modification plan. In some cases, owners report an almost immediate improvement. Others notice an increase in their dog’s anxiety only when a plug-in diffuser or collar expires, highlighting that DAP may provide subtle, but important, improvements. One blind dog who was experiencing aggression-related anxiety and had undergone some behavioral modification saw a marked improvement when wearing her DAP collar.\nAs with any behavioral challenge, Dr. Parthasarathy sees treatment as a puzzle, and her job is to find the pieces that need to come together to support the dog. She also recommends that owners begin with a visit to their regular veterinarian to rule out any potential medical reasons for the behavior.\nThe Best DAP Products\nUse this spray on your dog’s favorite bed or areas of the house where they tend to retreat when they’re afraid. Do they hide under your bed when thoseFourth of Julyfireworks go off? Spray Adaptil near that area to help support them. Headed out for adog-friendly road trip? Spray a little in their travel kennel. Or purchase the diffuser and plug it into an outlet in your living room for 30 days of pheromone-calming bliss.\nSimilar to the spray and diffuser, this calming collar provides continuous pheromone support for four weeks. This collar is a great option when the things that trigger your pup are outside the home. In combination with a training plan, it may help reduce stress if your dogbarks at strangersor other dogs when you’re walking around your neighborhood, or if your pup startles from sudden noises. Does your pup need to be at a boarding facility or veterinary hospital for an extended period of time? This collar may help them cope with jitters.

  "page_content": "Every day, at least three times a day, my dog, Cleo, and I take my building’s elevator down to the lobby so she can go on a walk. This means that every day, at least six times a day, I watch her happily sitting in the small, moving box and think, “What does she think is happening right now?”\nWhat does a dog comprehend of a machine that uses an elaborate system of cables and counterweights to transport them and their humans from one floor to another? From Cleo’s perspective, she enters a small room that smells like strangers, the doors slide shut, everything shakes for a few seconds, and when the doors open again, the space outside the room is different than when she first entered it. Does she know we’re moving? If she knows we’re moving, does she know we’re going up and down? Does she believe she’s been teleported? Do I need to find more fulfillment and novelty in my life so I stop spending so much time wondering how my dog perceives the experience of riding an elevator?\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nAny of these breeds are great for city living and available at shelters and rescues.\nPutting that last question aside for now, we can’t really know the answers to the others because, despite our best efforts to peer into dogs’ eyes and glean some understanding of what is doing on inside their soft, sweet heads, humans have completely yet to figure that out. But it’s still important to know how to make our pups’ lives as comfy for them as they can be — including when they walk inside a magical mechanical room.\nSo, howdodogs feel about elevators?\n“It would be totally awesome to be able to put [our dogs] on the couch and say, ‘Hey, how’s this feeling for you? What’s your experience? What are you seeing?’” says Dr. Leslie Sinn, CPDT, DVM, a veterinarian and animal behaviorist in Ashburn, Virginia. “Unfortunately, we don’t have that degree of insight.”\nI reached out to Dr. Sinn because I was curious about what was going on in Cleo’s head when we ride the elevator.  My questions were broad and abstract: How do dogs perceive the world, and how do we interpret what they may or may not be perceiving? How accurate are our interpretations and how well do we really understand our beloved pups? But Dr. Sinn pointed out that for many dog owners, the question of what their dog is experiencing in an elevator is more than just a whimsical thought experiment. It’s a very real challenge. Many of her clients have dogs who struggle in elevators. To Dr. Sinn, this isn’t that surprising. If you’re a dog, she says, riding an elevator might feel something like an earthquake.\nWaiting until full vaccination to socialize can cause huge problems for your pup.\n“They’re stepping on what is seemingly solid ground, and then all of a sudden the ground is moving,” she explains. “For many dogs, that’s a pretty terrifying experience unless it’s something that they’ve been introduced to early on.”\nBottom line: Elevators are scary.\nAdd to that the fact that elevators are often crammed with strangers, and you have the makings of an extremely stressful situation for a dog. When a dog feels uncomfortable, they can become scared, withdrawn, or, in some cases, reactive.\nWhile we may not know what, exactly, a dog thinks is happening in an elevator, Dr. Sinn says we can easily tell whether a dog is comfortable or not. A comfortable dog will have loose, relaxed body language. They will willingly respond to cues and willingly eat treats if they are offered to them. They will happily hop on the elevator and won’t desperately drag you out as soon as the doors open. An uncomfortable dog, on the other hand, will have stiff, tense body language. They tremble, hunch in a corner, or plaster themselves to the sides of your legs for comfort. “Worst case scenario, they start to become reactive because they’re trying to create space around themselves,” Dr. Sinn cautions.\nWhether you’re stuck in a tiny apartment or living on the road, @KeepingFinn’s Henry Friedman offers tips to not only endure—but thrive.\nThe best way to help a dog be comfortable in an elevator is to make sure they are exposed to the experience early on. But pet parents who have rescued adult dogs don’t have that option. In that case, Dr. Sinn says, there are a couple of ways to help. The first: Avoid the elevator altogether.\n“What I tell a lot of people is, depending on how many floors they have to walk up and down, maybe instead of viewing it as an impediment, they can view it as an opportunity for more exercise,” Dr. Sinn adds, laughing.\nStart small with the elevator.\nBut if the elevator is your only option for any reason, Dr. Sinn says the important thing when familiarizing your dog with the elevator is to start small. “You’ve got to back off a little bit and figure out ways to present it to them in small enough steps that they can handle it.”\nDog trainer Robert Haussmann gives a masterclass on pet parent etiquette for apartment living.\nDr. Sinn recommends calling the elevator during a quiet time of the day when not too many people will be riding it, holding it on your floor for a few minutes, and asking your dog to step in and out of it. As the dog becomes more confident, you can take short trips — just one or two floors —  and when they get off, play with them for a bit or give them a treat. “It starts being a positive experience and a happy thing, instead of something to be dreaded,” she says.\nIf your dog is reactive, Dr. Sinn said it’s important to avoid peak hours so as not to force them into situations where they’re scared. One point Dr. Sinn underscored, is that while many well-meaning pet parents have a tendency to force their dogs into a sort of DIY exposure therapy, and that’s not a helpful approach. In fact, it can often worsen the situation.\nSearching for pet-friendly housing? Reading this should be your first move.\nBe patient with your dog.\n“The impression with these dogs is that, if you do it enough, then all will be will,” she says “But if they’re already worried about the situation, and you keep exposing them to it without changing anything, all it does is confirm their worst fears because every time they’re exposed to it, they’re scared to death.”\nIn the end, we may never know for sure what dogs think is happening in an elevator. And in fairness, even some humans who fully understand elevators absolutely hate riding them. Dr. Sinn encourages parents to be compassionate and patient with their pups.\n“Try to see things through the dog’s eyes, right?” she advises. “Be aware, and realize that for a lot of them, it’s just not within their life experience. So be kind to them.”",

  "page_content": "Your pup’s practically fresh out of the womb, and you’ve been nothing but encouraging to them, but for some reason they still hover by your feet instead of hanging with their peers. First of all, there’s probably nothing to worry about: Just like people, some dogs are naturally more extroverted than others. So, don’t blame yourself or wonder what went wrong because genetics play a big role in a dogs’ temperament — and your pup can live a full, happy life, anyway.\nIf you have siblings (or keep up with the Kardashians), you’re probably not even alittleshocked that littermates can grow into adults who are wildly different from each other. Siblings, whether human or canine, aren’t clones — even identical twins have differences in their DNA. No matter how similar the upbringing, minor differences in siblings’ genetic makeup and their time in the womb account for major differences in behavior. Below, find out some scientific reasons that some puppies are shy orfearful, while others are more outgoing.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s tips for getting a shy pup to go from wallflower to social butterfly.\nThe Genetics of a Shy Puppy\nYou’re probably acquainted with physical variation in dogs, from flat-nosed Pugs to skinny-muzzled Salukis. But, this genetically mediated variation is equally true of behavioral predispositions. These differences are all thanks to the genetic makeup of each dog, which is unique to that individual. After all, the point of sexual reproduction — an inefficient and messy process (genetically speaking) — is variation.\nEach parent contributes one strand of DNA to the double helix that makes up each chromosome, and the strands link up in unique ways each time a new life is created. That said, every individual is the result of a unique combination of genes. In an environment with a range of conditions — perhaps a drought one year and floods the next — genetic variation increases the odds that some individuals will survive even if others perish, thus ensuring the continuation of at least some individuals of their particular species.\nDo your research. Know the facts.\nAccording to research on personality done over the past 30 years, one of the most heritable behavioral characteristics is called the “shy-bold continuum,” which has been found to be a relatively stable aspect of personality in some primates, cattle, people, and dogs (to name a few).\nIt appears as though different points on the “shy-bold” spectrum are advantageous at different times. For example, primatologist Steve Suomi has found that in some conditions, shy malerhesus monkeyshave higher reproductive success than bold ones. The shy males wait longer to leave their natal troops and arrive at a new troop larger and better able to hold their own when challenged by established males.\nYou can imagine how, in some contexts, the ancestors of domestic dogs might be best served by boldness (being the first to venture near a human settlement) or by caution and timidity (steering clear of lions).\nPro tips for boosting the confidence of a scaredy-cat dog.\nDifferent Experiences in the Womb\nBeyond an understanding of the role of genetics, research is increasingly focused on the effect of in-utero experiences on the development and, ultimately, the health and behavior of an individual.\nUntil recently, developmental considerations have focused on the influence of genetics and the environment during “early development” — the old nature/nurture argument. The period defined as “early development” began at birth and followed an animal through infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. But there’s also the important influence of in-utero experiences, an environment never before considered as having an effect on an adult animal.\nIn general, the influence of a mother’s experience on her fetus is profound: Hersleep patternteaches the developing pup about the cycle of day and night. Her food preferences influence her puppy’s after birth. If the mother is seriously deprived of food, her pup will be predisposed todiabetesand high cholesterol as an adult.\nMost relevant to a shy puppy, a mother suffering from extreme anxiety puts her offspring at high risk of beinganxiousand fearful, even as an adult. Apparently, high levels of the stress hormone cortisol produced by the mother result in fewer cortisol receptor cells in the pup. This low number of receptor cells means that the pup’s brain is unable to perceive and respond to high levels of cortisol in their own body until the system is overloaded with it. Then the brain goes on red alert, sending the emotions into full panic mode, even in situations that would be only mildly stressful for an average individual.\nFind out which dog breed is right for your lifestyle.\nIn addition to the significant effect of a mother’s influence on her young, we also know now that each individual’s experience within the uterus is different. Minordifferences in nutrients, for example, have long been known to be a factor in major differences in the size and health of animals within a litter. Even genetic clones — identical twins, for example — aren’t behaviorally identical. Though they may look alike, they usually have remarkably different personalities. Since they developed with the same set of genes, only in-utero experiences can account for their behavioral differences. Developmental psychologists are learning that for twins, development in the womb is a kind of dance between the two that, by the time they are born, has shaped their personalities.\nAnother example of the influence of in-utero development is what’s called “androgenization.” In this phenomenon,femalesin a litter are permanently affected by the androgen produced by male puppies surrounding them within the uterine horns. Androgen is the precursor to testosterone, and females who are “bathed” in it, perhaps because of their placement between a large number of males, tend to behave differently than other females once they develop into adults.\nAnd so, even prior to birth, profoundly different experiences could have shaped puppies from the same litter. The combination of different genetic blueprints and different experiences inside the womb resulted in two dogs with very different personalities and tolerances. Even though they have grown up together, those beginnings mean that a similar environment will affect them in different ways as they continue to develop. Your shy puppy will probably always be more cautious than other outgoing pups — because much of who they are was established before they were born.",

  "page_content": "It’s been three years (count ’em) since we were all told to stay inside our homes for an indefinite amount of time. During that excruciatingly confusing period, we told ourselves we loved to bake bread, do puzzles, and, most of all, that we were OK — insert always-relevant “this is fine” meme here. The one thing that was actually good about staying home for months on end was our dogs.\nWhen they realized we were never leaving, they rewarded us with extra snuggle time and lots of opportunities of taking photos of them sleeping like baby angels. But, now that many of us are back in the office and just generally living our lives because society demands it, our dogs are left to cope on their own, which results in, yes, you guessed it,separation anxiety. And my dog Emma definitely has a pretty serious case of it.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nDesperate to help Emma, I brought in multiple dog trainers, consulted four vets, cooked her food from scratch, gave her interactive food toys, and played calming music. I even hired a doggie masseuse. Results? Her separation anxiety only got worse: She didn’t stop barking, pacing, and peeing on the floor when I left. She even started chewing at my doorframe. Thankfully, there was a solution to my and Emma’s problem, and (a plus for your nervous pup) they didn’t include either of us having to leave the house.\nIt’s 2023, and the office is calling. How can our dogs cope?\nThe Shift Toward Online Dog Training\nMalena DeMartini — a California-based dog trainer and graduate of theAcademy for Dog Trainersunder the guidance of Jean Donaldson — has focused solely on separation-anxiety cases. Over time, she has become one of the leading experts (if nottheleading expert) on the condition. By using technology (smartphones, tablets, laptops, cameras), she is also transforming the way dogs, in general, are trained.\nDeMartini and the 20-plus separation-anxiety trainers she has certified do not work with clients in person. Instead, they do the job online: meet via apps such as Zoom or FaceTime and create and share spreadsheets so clients know exactly how to train their dogs each day. The team even reviews video footage with clients to teach them how to read their dogs’ body language. Training online also offsets the complication of bringing someone into the home when the goal is to help the dog handle timealone.\nDeMartini began offering onlineseparation-anxietytraining in 2008, saving her time and energy and, more importantly, allowing her to observe a dog in real time. Rather than review what went on after the fact, she could modify the training protocol online as the behavior was in progress.\nTrain your dog to stay calm when they’re on their own — instead of sad-singing“All By Myself”until you come home.\nCreating an Individualized Separation Anxiety Plan\nWorking with one of DeMartini’s trainers, Caryn Liles, who lives in Toronto, we began our online training sessions. I stacked books on a chair facing the front door and set my MacBook on top while Liles observed Emma while I went for a walk outside. The tiny pup had a threshold of 10 seconds — meaning Emma could only handle being alone in the house for 10 seconds. That was our starting point.\nUntil completing the separation-anxiety protocol, Emma could only be left alone in the house during her training sessions. “The first goal is to teach the dog, ‘Hey, you know what? You’re okay for a full second of being left alone, or three seconds,’” DeMartini says. And once they get to that point, they’re like, ‘The sky didn’t fall! Amazing!’” The training wouldn’t work if, for example, their pet parent then drove away and caught a two-hour movie. Note: When we do want to catch a movie or go out to dinner, my husband and I have recruited friends and pet sitters to keep Emma company. (For dogs who enjoy spending time with other pups,doggie daycarecan be a great option; unfortunately, Emma’s not a fan.)\nThe morning following that assessment meeting, Liles sent me a Google Sheet titled “Mission One,” a series of 12 exercises that started with the following:\nOpen front door one inch, close it, return.\nOpen front door one inch, close it, return.\nStand outside the front door for one second, return.\nStand outside the front door for one second, return.\nOpen the door one inch, close it, return.\nOpen the door one inch, close it, return.\nStand outside for one second, return.\nStand outside for one second, return.\nTurn door handle, return.\nTurn door handle, return.\nWe asked both animal behaviorists and human psychologists howyoucan deal with leaving your dog home alone.\nAt the start of each exercise, I grabbed my keys and purse from the kitchen and then put them back upon my return. I was instructed to wait 60 to 90 seconds between each exercise, at which point I would type into the spreadsheet a description of Emma’s behavior during my absence and what her recovery looked like.\nWhile outside, I watch Emma on my iPhone through a camera mounted above the fireplace. If you have multiple smartphones or tablets, another option is to use an app that turns one device into a video camera and allows you to watch on another.\nMaking Quick Progress\nEach day, Liles reviews the previous mission and then creates a new one based on the results. We repeated Mission One for seven days before graduating tofive whole secondsout the door on Mission Two.\n“I teach a dog to be relaxed in incredibly small increments,” DeMartini says about her training protocol. “People initially have a sort of pushback, if you will, like, ‘Oh, my gosh, we’re starting with one second? What? This is crazy! It’s gonna be the year 2037 before I ever leave my dog!’”\nThankfully, it doesn’t take a decade for most dogs to be desensitized to being alone, thoughsome dogs need medicationto help them relax enough to succeed, and some, unfortunately, can never get past theirfear. Most of DeMartini’s clients complete training somewhere in the three-to six-month range (meaning the dog can handle being alone for four or five hours). But DeMartini hesitates to give time estimates. Each dog is different, and anxiety level does not necessarily predict speed.\nIt was a trick question. A study shows that the pandemic has made us all codependent.\nTraining Emma on her separation-anxiety fears is also improving her fears in other areas, too. By not losing it every time the front door creaks open, Emma has gained confidence overall. She no longer cocks an ear and furrows her brow when a construction crew bangs outside or televised gunshots ring out in surround sound. And rather thanshake in terror in the car, Emma now puts her nose up to the window opening. When I glance over at Emma, flopped on her side napping peacefully in a sun patch on the rug, I know that we’re making progress.",

  "page_content": "Patricia McConnell, PhD, had me at “separation anxiety.” But not in the way you’d expect. “I do indeed suffer from separation anxiety when I leave my dogs,” therenowned animal behaviorist and authorsays. “I don’t know about you, but I’m already starting to stress lick.”\nMy reaction? I’m not alone! It turns out that separation anxiety in pet parents — which ranges from a reluctance to leave your dog for even a few minutes to a complete inability to travel — is a lot more common than I realized. In fact, nearly half of the pet parent population can relate; aCertaPet studyfound that 47% of dog parents experience separation anxiety when away from their pets.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nIt was a trick question. A study shows that the pandemic has made us all codependent.\nIf you’re anything like me, you’ve probably figured outhow to deal with your dog’s separation anxiety— but what about your own? Here are some pointers from McConnell and other behavior specialists.\nWhat Separation Anxiety Looks Like in Pet Parents\n“It’s so individual,” says Faith Maloney, co-founder ofBest Friends Animal Society, who, along with psychologist Linda Harper, PhD, has helped many pet parents deal with their anxiety. “Every single situation that I’ve come across is unique to that person or that family.”\nOne scenario does pop up a lot, though, she adds. Something bad happens while the pet parent is away — the dog gets sick at a boarding kennel, for example, or the dog sitter forgets to show up. “Then, based on some of these traumatic experiences, people say, ‘I can never leave again.’”\nDoggy daycare is more than just fun and games.\nFor others, the mere fact that their dog had a rough past before they adopted them can keep them tethered to their pup. “I’ve got rescues,” says Sarah Bartley, who is mom to a 14-year-old Pit Bull/Greyhound mix, an 8-year-old Shepherd/Border Collie mix, and two previously neglected horses. “I gave my dogs my word when I took them on that they would have the best life possible,” she says. “They’ve come to love me, so I don’t want to go out without them.”\nI made a similar promise to my Beagle, Emma, who was a caged breeder before she came to live with us. She crawled into my lap the moment I met her at theNorth Shore Animal Leaguein New York, and my lap remains Emma’s safe place when she’s scared or insecure. I love that Emma wants to press into me every chance she gets, and comes straight to me when she needs support. But when I comfort her, am I making it harder for her to stand on her own two — er, four — feet?\nHow to Deal With Your Separation Anxiety\n“You can’t change what happened to your dog,” McConnell says. “But you can do everything possible to help your dog be a healthy, happy, stable individual. Dogs who have been really damaged tend to be brittle. But we work toward creating individuals who are more flexible, who can bend rather than crack,” she says.\nSet your pup up for success.\nUnderstanding that the best thing I can do for Emma is to help her develop the confidence and comfort level to be alone helpedmedeal with my own separation anxiety. “When you think about what you’re really doing, to be effective as a pet owner, giving dogs the skills to be independent is one of the best gifts,” says Pamela Uncles, MEd, CDBC, a Virginia-based animal behavior consultant.\nIt’s helpful for pet parents to understand that as soon as they bring a dog into their home, they need to start preparing the pup (and themselves) for time apart. Of course, even if the dogs can handle our departures, that doesn’t guarantee it will be easy for us to say good-bye.\nMcConnell doesn’t travel as much as she used to, she says, and missing her dogs is a factor in that decision. “I know when I come home from being gone, the way they greet me, they’re clearly over-the-moon happy to see me, but I don’t have dogs with separation anxiety,” she says. “They’re fine. I think it’s more about me.”\nSome psychologists, such as Chicago-based Linda Harper, PhD, who specializes in helping people deal with the highs and lows of caring for animals, say it’s normal to experience strong emotions for their pups. “It is in the animal advocate’s nature to experience intense feelings for animals,” Harper writes in her book,The Power of Joy in Giving to Animals. “We feel what we think they feel. They’re not ‘just an animal.’ We read pain in their eyes, we interpret their whines and barks and meows. We feel their excitement and we imagine their disappointment.”\nApparently wild dogs can be pretty cute, too.\nBartley not only felt such intense emotions, she also recognized that she was giving all that she had to her animals and not taking enough for herself. In eight years, she had only traveled once; she even reduced her hours working to part-time so she didn’t have to leave her dogs alone so long.Okay, you’re getting kind of crazy, Bartley recalls saying to herself last year.You have to let go a little bit.So she made arrangements for someone to care for her animals and attended a retreat designed to help pet parents deal with their separation anxiety — a great idea, according to McConnell.\n“A good first step is to travel to a dog behavior or training seminar,” she says. Concerned owners can justify leaving their pup at home because they’re going to learn something that will benefit them. After returning home to a happy and healthy dog (assuming all goes well), they just might feel confident enough to try traveling again.\nBut for some — even when they know that their dogs can handle their absences and will receive great care while they’re gone — going on vacation can be bittersweet. What does McConnell do during the really rough times? She turns to good ol’ classical conditioning: “I literally eat chocolate,” she admits. “Never, ever dismiss the power of chocolate.”",

  },
  "page_content": "Charley, a rescued three-year-old Lab who’d spent his entire life in an outdoor kennel, was scared of everything when we first got him. He’s been with us for eight months, and now, he panics when we leave him alone. We have two crates, one in our house and one in our car. He goes into the home crate and stays there for about an hour. I’ve been gradually closing the door and even leaving the house, and when I come back, he’s fine. However, when we put him in his car crate, he just loses it, so distraught that he’s destroyed a crate bed and a quilt. Is this separation anxiety? We adore him and want to help him, but what can we do?\nCharley is obviously suffering from a form ofseparation distress, which is not uncommon for a dog who has spent so much of his life in relative isolation. Fear of abandonment and the desire to seek reattachment are what drive some dogs into a panic when left alone, and the resulting destructive behavior is a manifestation of this desperate feeling.Extensive research has shown that dogs suffer from the same kinds offears, phobias, and anxieties as do humans, even experiencing the canine equivalent of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). It would not surprise me if your dog were suffering from a version of PTSD, which could be triggered by being inconfined places, even in a car that he knows. Dogs who become distressed when left alone typically do not do well in confined spaces such ascrates, and in Charley’s case, it’s evident that his anxiety is a result of his previous confinement.You seem to have made good progress desensitizing your pup to the crate in your home, and a similar routine needs to be adopted for the crate in your car. Until he is completely comfortable being in the car, it’s better for him to stay at home, where he feels secure. If you try taking him in the car too early in the process, he will revert to his former behavior, so be sure to work slowly. Here is a step-by-step guide to help a dog scared of cars become accustomed to their crate.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nHow to treat and prevent confinement anxiety.\nCrate Training for Dogs Scared of Car Rides\nTo begin with, show your dog that being in the car is a good thing. At various times during the day, walk him to where your car is parked and either feed him his favorite food in the car or play his favorite game around it.\nAs your dog becomes accustomed to hanging around the car, open the doors and sit next to your pup while he is in his crate, with the crate door open so he can leave if he wants. Allowing him the freedom to make choices will help increase his confidence.\nGive him a durable rubber toy, like afrozen kong, stuffed with food to chew when he’s in the crate. If, however, he decides to leave, gently take the toy from your dog and place it in the crate again, showing him that’s where he gets the nice stuff.\nWhat to do when your dog barks at everything from other cars to people.\nOnly when you see that your dog is eager to be in the car crate with the door open should you start closing the door for short periods while you sit with him. Gradually increase the length of time the door is closed.\nAt this point, you can begin moving away from the car for a minute or two while your pup is chewing on his toy, returning frequently to praise him for calm behavior. As long as your dog is showing no signs of anxiety, you can spend more time away from the car. Repeat this training in different environments until he’s completely comfortable.\nOnce your dog is comfortable in the crate while you drive, take him to a variety of places and repeat the exercise, which will help him learn that being in the car with you in different environments is a good thing.\nIf your pup doesn’t respond to desensitization, you may have to get rid of the crate altogether and use acanine seatbelt harnessinstead, which will keep them safe while allowing them a little more freedom. This in itself may be the only change you need to make for them to feel more secure when they are in the car.\nHitting the road with your dog? Make sure they're safe with this helpful advice.\nA Word of Caution on Leaving Dogs in Cars\nIt goes without saying that a dog should never be left in a hot car. But did you know that it is dangerous to leave them in the car when the weather’s warm (or very cold) too? In direct sunlight, a car can heat up within minutes, even on relatively cool days. A recentstudyfound that 39% of participants were unaware of the ideal temperature in a car for a dog, and almost 16% didn’t know the signs ofheat stroke. Never leave your dog alone in a car with the outside temperatures above 70 degrees outside. Leave your dog at home if you know you will be running errands or going to dinner.",

  "page_content": "As an elder millennial, I can remember a time when television was not only live but filled with a slew of anti-marijuana ads. During the early aughts, you’d regularly be exposed to TV spots suggesting that ingesting any part of the plant would result in onepancaking themselves on the couch,perpetrating hit and runs, or accidentallyshooting their friends— as if weed, and not the loaded weapon left on a table easily accessible by teenagers, were the problem.\nLuckily, societies evolve. Today, usage of hemphas been reevaluatedand while everybody’s tolerance toward recreational THC intake may vary, most would agree the plant has at least a few promising components — namely CBD. So as more and more CBD brands continue to pop up, it’s only natural they’d start offering options for our pets.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nDad Grassrecently doubled down on this trend, offeringCBD bonesand aplush pack of jointsfor our pups to enjoy. The emerging brand launched in the middle of 2020, a time when we could all use a more natural way to chill and destress. Thanks to its straightforward and nonintoxicating pre-rolls and late ‘60sEasy Rider-type aesthetic, it quickly gained a following. Now, Dad Grass is welcoming dogs into its cigar lounge atmosphere.\nEach dog bone features four milligrams of the same organic full-spectrum CBD that Dad Grass puts in its edibles, smokables, and other human products. The dairy-free, gluten-free, and 100 percent vegan recipe is even pumpkin-flavored sopups can be festivewhile they munch down and mellow out. Not to mention, the packaging is entirely compostable. Of course, like most incipient resources, CBD’s full effect on dogs is still being studied.\nWhile there is encouraging evidence of the oil’s ability to help treat inflammatory issues,seizures,pain relief, andanxiety, a scientific conscious is TBD. If you’re unsure about introducing CBD into your dog’s routine, it might be best to recruit the counsel of your primary veterinarian.\nBut if you just want to dip your dog’s paws in the world of CBD, Dad Grass’s plush pack of joints is a perfect alternative. It doesn’t include any actual CBD and is instead just a rad-looking squeaker toy. Resembling something between a pack of Swisher Sweets and a deck of cards, this option will allow your dog to still enjoy the hype without ingesting any materials you’re not comfortable with.\nTo promote this new line, Dad Grass enlisted the help of LA-based photographerScottie Cameron. In what the brand has affectionally named “Doggy Styles: Vol 1.,” Cameron shot various pups chilling in front of vintage TVs, next to record players, and with Fender guitars. Beyond capturing what was essentially my entire existence as a young hipster living in Williamsburg, Cameron impeccably portrays the essence of pet parenthood. That is to say, the chaotic and unbearable cuteness our dogs ooze at every turn.\nWhen speaking on the experience to Dad Grass,Cameron explained, “You just have to give into the madness and hope for the best. Luckily dogs are truly wonderful and even when they’re being insane you get great pictures.” Additionally, this is precisely why they deserve — and might need — a treat to help them zen out.\nDisclaimer alert: This article is here to share information. But, much like pineapple on pizza, the topic may be controversial. Meaning, not all vets or pet professionals agree. Because every pet is a unique weirdo with specific needs. So, don’t take this as fact or medical advice. Talk things over with your vet when making decisions, and use your best judgment (about both your pet’s health and pizza toppings).",

    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/my-dog-freezes-walks-normal"
  },
  "page_content": "As a dog behaviorist, I often get asked, “Is what my dog doing normal?” Top topics that pop up regularly are: rolling in garbage or poop,eating poop,chasing their tail,chewing their paws,humping,crotch-sniffing, and, well, the list goes on.\nThe answer to most of these? “Yes, they are all perfectly normal behaviors” — they’re just not activities that we humans are familiar with or particularly comfortable with. Sometimes, I’m asked if it’s normal for a dog to stop short and freeze completely while on a walk, like your neighborhood’s newest statue. The answer depends on the severity of the situation. Here’s everything you need to know.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nHow Do Dogs React to Fear?\nIf your dog freezes multiple times during a walk, that can be pretty distressing — for both you and your dog. There can be many reasons for freezing. To modify the behavior, you need to understand the underlying issue, which ismost likely fear. Dogs tend to react in four ways when they feel uneasy. Commonly referred to as the Four Fs of Fear by dog experts, these include:\nFight\nFight\nFlight\nFlight\nFreeze\nFreeze\nFooling around\nFooling around\nAlmost everyone has heard of the fight or flight response — the tendency to either stand and confront the source of your fear (fight) or to run from it (flight). Both of these reactions can be observed regularly by humans and animals alike.\nThere’s nothing to fear but fear itself — and a dog who won’t stop shaking when it thunders.\nThe two lesser-known reactions are to freeze or fool around. Fooling around is a displacement behavior. It is a behavior that is inappropriate to the situation but diffuses the tension and relieves stress. If a dog is presented with an object or person they have not seen before, they may dance around, hot-stepping or barking at the unknown and somewhat scary new thing.\nWhy do dogs freeze?\nFreezing is exactly as it sounds. Your dog will freeze, relying on stillness to go undetected, like a deer in headlights. Dogs commonly exhibit freezing when reacting to stress or fear. Once they’re still, they assess the situation and then decide what to do next. Is it safe to move on or could the danger still be in the area? If they continue to feel under threat, theymay refuse to walkon.\nDogs have extremely sensitive noses, amazing hearing, and an incredible line of vision. They may smell, hear, or see something that you’re not aware of. Maybe they can hear the neighborhood bully dog in the distance, smell the treat lady’s biscuits, or see kids in hoodies that remind them of past trauma.\nPro tips for boosting the confidence of a scaredy-cat dog.\nInterestingly, dogs can freeze without you even noticing. The freeze, assessment, and decision to continue is so rapid that the dog has moved on before the freeze is noted. This assessment will include the dog’s current circumstances, their well-being, and who they are with. The confidence that a dog has in their human is similar to that of a child with a parent. Dogs who wholeheartedly trust their human and their ability to defend are far less likely to freeze while in their presence.\nIf your dog is showing signs of severe fearfulness, I suggestcontacting a canine behaviorist and dog trainerto understand the triggers and work on building your dog’s confidence. Telltale signs of severe fearfulness include:tail between legs, shaking, flitting from one spot to another, and distress peeing.\nOther Freezing Triggers\nAnother common cause of freezing could be learned behavior. For example, if you try to get your dog to walk bygiving them a treat, your dog will start to think freezing results in a treat and will repeat the behavior. Stop rewarding the behavior and they’ll stop freezing.\nNot all fearful dogs have been mistreated.\nOf course, there could be other reasons your dog is freezing on walks. Maybe they’re tired and want to go home, they’re thirsty and want a drink, their feet are aching, or they’re stubborn and want towalk a different route. They may remember the bread that was left out for the birds at the house two streets up and hope it will be there again today.\nHow to Prevent Your Dog From Freezing on Walks\nBuilding confidence is the best solution. It could be that your dog needs to feel more confident with you. Or, it could be that they need to feel more confident when outside. Or, it could be a combination of the two. Building confidence will reduce freezing and encourage your dog to continue to walk — but this can be a long game, depending on how deep-rooted the fear is.\nMake a diary of your walks to find patterns in your dog’s freezing. Is there a certain route they do not like? Are there certain noises that trigger them? Does daytime or nighttime produce more freezing? Do they freeze more with one member of the family than another?\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nGathering this information means you can start to create a walk that avoids the triggers. Why stress your dog out unnecessarily? Building confidence occurs much more quickly if a dog is not already stressed and anticipating fear before they have even left the house.\nDo not force your dog to walk in a direction that they’re scared to go in. You will gain more trust by taking a different route than forcing them to walk on. You might need to only cross the street but to your dog, you are addressing their discomfort and taking control of the situation. As trust builds in you and freezing subsides, you can start to tackle the source of the fear.\nThe bottom line: Dogs live in the moment. If a dog freezes, they’re doing so for a reason. Work with your dog to understand that reason and then address it. Walks are supposed to be enjoyable for both you and your dog. After all, they’re an enjoyable way for you both to exercise, socialize, and bond.",

  "page_content": "Most people look forward to the first cool night of the year after a long, sweltering summer. But those people don’t live with my two dogs.\nEvery year at the end of the summer, the air conditioning goes off and the absence of white noise has my dogs on high alert for any foreign noise occurring outside my cracked window. One crunch of a leaf is enough to set them off like sleeper agents whose code word has just been activated. Before I had dogs, I couldn’t wait for the whirr of white noise to cease, but now, instead of a sweet autumnal silence, I’m left with the Fall Call of my barking dogs.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nThis year, I became determined to find a solution that would bring me some peace and quiet. While looking for solutions, I had multiple friends with dogs try to sell me their personal favorite snake oil a.k.a “calming chews.” If you have ever had to help your dog through a stressful situation, you have probably come across these types of supplements during your initial Google search. Many swear by them, but I rarely have found them to work.\nBut recently, as the first cool night approached, I was still no closer to finding my holy grail. As the night went on and my air conditioner both roared on and froze me out, I was desperate to find anything that would allow both myself and my pups to enjoy some zen. I went to my downstairs neighbor, one of my nearest and dearest snake oil salesmen, and asked if I could borrow some of hisNative Pet calming chews. With active ingredients, including melatonin, L-theanine, thiamine, and hemp seed, I figured something in there might do the trick.\nAnd I was right! This is not a magic pill, but the calming chews significantly lowered both of my dogs’ stress thresholds. We were actually able to go to bed at a reasonable hour, even as leaves, sticks, and even acorns crunched outside our window.\nI was so impressed I decided to look more into the brand and their other supplements. After taking a tour of Native Pet’s very aesthetically pleasing website, I ordered their Allergy Chews, Bone Broth Topper, and Yak Chews. With my dogs’ eyes getting itchier as allergy season dragged on, plus our continued battle with picky eating, I figured these three products would tell me everything I needed to know about Native Pet.\nTo start, the allergy chews and broth topper were a hit. The allergy chews gave my pups considerable relief, and the bone broth was lapped up with enthusiasm. The Yak Chews were sniffed at and ignored — but I suppose Yak milk is one of those acquired tastes, even for dogs.\nAll in all, the Native Pet products seemed like a success — albeit an expensive one. Native Pet’s products range from $12 to $32, with most products falling somewhere in the middle. For some things, it makes sense: the bone broth is powdered, which means a small $20  package will still get you up to 48 servings (plus it’s great for travel!). But other products, like the Yak Chews, are $18 for three medium chews — that’s like buying your dog three dried Yak-curd Frappuccinos.\nNative Pet is committed, however, to full transparency about its ingredients, as reflected by their website and blog. That’s important when shopping for supplements for your pet because as a rule, most pet food and supplements arenot required to be FDA approvedbefore being sold to the public. This means consumers must rely on the transparency of companies, like Native Pet, to tell us where their ingredients come from and how they are used in their products. Because of their lack of filler and mystery ingredients, Native Pet’s higher prices reflect a genuinely premium product.\nBut maybe skip the Yak Chews.",

  "page_content": "It all started forDr. Marty Beckerin 1963: That was the year his family’s outdoor Labrador Retriever came inside the house.\nDr. Becker grew up on a small family farm that raised potatoes and other crops, in addition to cows, sheep, and pigs. Dogs served a utilitarian role on the farm — they herded cattle and guarded the property among other duties. But when a blizzard swept through in 1963, a young Dr. Becker successfully convinced his father to let their outdoor dog spend the night inside. He never left.\nlittleKin™is Kinship’s homejustfor puppy and kitten parents. Bop over to check out expert advice, new pet tools, and special deals—all curated for your newest family member.\nIn the decades since, Dr. Becker has made a name for himself as “America’s Veterinarian”; he was the resident veterinary contributor onGood Morning Americafor 17 years, is the author of23 books, and is also the founder ofFear Free, which provides online education to veterinary and pet professionals, animal welfare communities, and pet owners. Kinshiprecently sat down with Dr. Becker to ask him about what Fear Free actually means — and why modern-day pet parents, whosepets are their children, are embracing the method.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nIt boils down to looking at [a pet’s] physical and emotional well-being. Before Fear Free, the focus was always on physical wellbeing. Most of my colleagues and I thought that fear, anxiety, and stress were collateral damage — that there was nothing you could do. You could still be compassionate, you could still look at pain, but you just had to accept that [a pet] hated going to the veterinarian or trainer or groomer.\nFear-Free training is positive reward-based training. Part of our slogan is to “put the treat into treatment.” You show [a pet] what you want them to do and then reward them when they do it, or get close to doing it. Fear Free always works to reduce or remove triggers that cause fear, anxiety, and stress.\nYou gotta start somewhere.\nIf I were a therapist, I could ask you all sorts of things that happened in your life that were traumatic and you could ferret them out and we could decide we’re going to avoid this, or you’re going to deal with it this way. With a pet, you have no ideawhat happened to them. Were theyattacked by another dogwhen they were younger? Did something negative happen to them on a walk? Were they dragged out of a cage at a veterinary hospital?\n[Fear-Free training involves] the pet parent on the front end of visiting a veterinarian, groomer, or trainer. A pet parent can’t bring in a pet that’s really agitated and throwing up from stress and think it’s going to be a good visit. [Fear-Free training] starts in the living room. If a pet is going to be in a carrier, [the pet parent] got it out a week before, not the night before or the morning of. High-value rewards are given there so there are positive associations with the carrier. In transport, you keep the car at the same temperature as the house. If you’re going to a trainer, it’s the same temperature there. If the dog is in the carrier, you make sure the carrier is not tipped and covered on three sides by a light sheet to reduce visual stimuli.\nFear Free is a science-based organization. There’s over 300 studies it’s based on. We fund a decent amount of research for the size or our company. We know, for example, that pets in transport like fleece better than towels. They like pastel colors and certain types of music. It’s how pets are introduced to a facility. If somebody comes to your house or if you go to a groomer, if the pet is greeted outside in what is neutral territory, it makes a big difference, as opposed to going inside the facility, because then they’re not territorial.\n[Humans] are primarily verbal communicators and [pets are] primarily body- language communicators. Once you understand [your pet’s]body language, you almost crack the code on a different level of understanding and appreciating your dog. You get to where you’re detecting the most subtle changes early on before it erupts into something worse.\nDogs and cats can’t read self-help books, so a veterinary behaviorist explains how your pet may benefit from being in treatment.\nI was at a conference in 2009, andDr. Karen Overallgave the keynote. Her talk changed my life. Her first sentence was, “Fear is the worst thing a social species can experience, and it causes permanent damage to the brain.” Second sentence: “Those of us in veterinary medicine, training, grooming, animal services are causing repeat, severe psychological damage to pets by what we are doing or not doing.” She continued: “Behavior produces a physiologic response so behavior is medicine. Fear is caused by something painful or something disturbing.”\nShe gave some great examples. You trim a dog’snails too short.Now when they see the nail trimmer, or even the place where you trim them or the drawer that they’re held in — that’s disturbing.\nThe thing that really got me: All pets are the equivalent of a 1-year-old child. There are four reasons. One, they’re taken against their will for healthcare. Two, they have zero idea why a procedure benefits them. Three, they have no concept of time. And lastly, they have no control — they can’t flee the threat. That’s the important part; we have control over stuff that they don’t.\nThere’s nothing to fear but fear itself — and a dog who won’t stop shaking when it thunders.\nWe figured out how to do [Fear-Free training] in the veterinary hospital, in probably the worst setting. If we could remove or reduce the triggers — we call it “taking the pet out of petrified” — in that setting, we figured you could probably do it in other settings. And we thought, what good is it to have a phenomenal visit to the veterinarian when [a pet is] suffering from anxiety and stress at home?\nSo, we’ve [created certificates for] training, grooming, pet sitting, boarding, and daycare, dog walking is coming up. Everybody that has contact with a pet [should look] at both its physical and emotional well-being.\nProbably the biggest thing is that pets don’t have emotions like we do. You can’t anthropomorphize pets too much, but pets definitely have feelings. When your dog looks at you, that is the look of love. That is unmistakable; it melts you. I don’t think a human can do the same thing — it doesn’t look the same. So yes they love, yes they have fear, have anxiety, have loneliness. They have all these same things.\nThe other thing is that every single day your dog is being trained. Something happens that changes [the pet’s] behavior every day, so you have to be careful that you’re always working so the pet has the kind of manners that fit in with the happy home.\nIt’s a gut thing: Your dog’s GI issues could be linked to their mental health.\nFear Free Happy Homesis complementary to all pet parents. There’s no login or barriers. Everything we have is reviewed by [a] boarded veterinary behaviorist. That’s one of the things we’re really proud of. It’s authentic information.\nThe worst thing for a pet parent is to feel like you’re hurting your pet by trying to help them. If your pet thinks it will absolutely be harmed or is going to die when it goes to the veterinarian, that’s a red flag. If the vet insists on putting your pet up on the table every time, that’s a red flag. If they’re handling them roughly or restraining them, that’s a red flag.\nWhat [Fear Free does] is gentle control. You still get the same thing — positional compliance — but it’s designed to protect the pet. Restraint is designed to protect people. So your pet should be more cooperative in its care — they’re not showing extreme distress, they’re taking treats. You can tell if your vet has an affection for your pet and isn’t treating it like an inanimate object.\nAnd trainers — anyone that is using prongcollarsor shock collars or any kind of aversive training.\nThe questions to ask and credentials to look out for to find the right trainer foryourdog, according to a pro.\nIf you love your pet like family, I would want you to have the same level of science and soul that you would have for a human child or grandchild or nephew or niece — that physical and emotional wellbeing are important. Fear Free is where high tech meets high touch, where state of the art meets state of the heart. Yeah, we’ve got the science behind it, the studies behind it, but more than that, we love pets like family and we want to see them live happy, healthy, full lives.",

  "page_content": "There is no guidebook to pet parenting. In fact, you probably don’t ever want unsolicited advice from your neighbor’s cousin’s girlfriend on how to train your new puppy. But, much like regular parenting, there is a lot of misinformation out there about what you should do in any situation, like when your puppy is scared, crying, or needs a cuddle.\nMany pet parents have been taught that trying to soothe frightened dogs just makes them worse. It seems logical: Your pup hears thunder, they run to you and you pet them. Voilà, your dog just got reinforced for running to you when it thunders, and worse, for being afraid of thunderstorms in the first place. But that’s not what actually happens!\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nFirst, no amount of petting is going to make it worthwhile for your pup to work themselves into a panic for no reason. Fear is no more fun for dogs than it is for people; they wouldn‘t put themselves in that state on purpose. The function of fear is to signal the body that there is danger present, and that the individual feeling fearful had better do something to make the danger, and the fear that accompanies it, go away.\nPro tips for boosting the confidence of a scaredy-cat dog.\nThink of it this way: Imagine you’re eating ice cream when someone tries to break into your house at midnight. Would the pleasure of eating ice cream “reinforce” you for being afraid, so that you’d be more afraid the next time? If anything, things would work in the reverse — you might develop an unconscious discomfort around ice cream. However, you sure as heck aren’t going to be more afraid if a burglar arrives just because you were eating mint-chocolate chip the first time it happened.\nStudying Stress\nThere’s another reason why petting your thunder-phobic dog doesn’t make them worse: Research on thunder-phobic dogs suggests that petting does not decrease the level of stress in the dog receiving it. The authors measured the production of cortisol, a hormone related to stress. They found that cortisol levels did not decrease when the dogs were being petted by their guardians during storms. (The most important factor in decreasing cortisol was the presence of other dogs.)\nInterestingly, another piece of research on social bonding found that although cortisol levels decrease in people when they are interacting with dogs, cortisol does not decrease in dogs in the same context. However, in both species, other hormones and neurotransmitters increased, includingoxytocin, prolactin and beta-endorphin — all substances that are associated with good feelings and social bonding. So, while petting your dog during a storm may not decrease cortisol levels, it is still possible that something good could be happening.\nTips for comforting your pup when the storm is too loud for your pup’s comfort.\nOn the contrary, it’s just not possible thatpetting your dogis going to make them more fearful the next time there’s a storm. Feel free to offer them all the comfort you can, especially if they are into physical affection.\nA Classical Approach\nThe greatest damage that’s done with outdated “don’t pet the dog” advice doesn’t relate to storms but to the pitfalls of trying to explain classical counter-conditioning (CCC). CCC can be a profoundly effective way to change behavior, because it changes the emotions that drive the behavior in the first place. A typical example in applied animal behavior is having visitors throw treats to a dog who is afraid of strangers.\nUnderstandably, many humans have asked, “But isn’t giving treats when they’re barking andgrowlingjust going to make it worse? Won’t they get reinforced for barking and growling?” The answer is no — not if their behavior is driven by fear. Remember, fear is no fun, and a few pieces of food, no matter how yummy, aren’t going to override the brain’s desire to avoid it.\nNot all fearful dogs have been mistreated.\nTossing treats (or toys) to afearful dogcan teach them to associate approaching strangers with something good, as long as the treat is really, really good, and the visitor is far enough away to avoid overwhelming the dog. CCC is one of the most important tools in a trainer or behaviorist’s toolbox, yet it can be hard to convince people to try it. It feels like rewarding a dog for misbehaving, and in our punishment-oriented, “you’ve got to get dominance over your dog” society, it is tough for some people to do.\nCCC is one of many ways you can help a thunder-phobic dog. I’ve used some of the following with good success, either on their own or combined with other methods: pheromone therapy, wraps, acupuncture, acupressure, diet change, and, in serious cases, medication. If your dog is afraid of storms, you’d do well to consult a behaviorist or veterinary behaviorist for assistance in choosing the method that is right for you and your pup.\nFear Is Contagious\nYour dog watches what you do, and they trust you. So, if you are scared about something, your pup will pick up on that and might get even more afraid. The emotion of fear is so compelling that it is easy to spread around. “Emotional contagion” is the term used to describe the viral spread of fear within a group, and it’s a common occurrence among social species. If you’re afraid of storms, it is entirely possible that your dog will pick up on it and become more nervous.\nRemember, dogs have more than one emotion.\nHowever, if you are freaked out (and who isn’t sometimes?), all is not lost. You cancalm things downby concentrating on your body — slowing down your breathing and your movements, changing your posture to one of confidence and relaxation, and speaking slowly and calmly (if at all). These actions have the beneficial effect of altering your own emotions as well as your dog’s.\nThe calmer you pretend to be, the calmer you’ll actually feel. And your dog, who looks to you with those adorable puppy-dog eyes, will chill out, too.\nSources:Nancy Dreschel, DVM, & Douglas Granger, PhD. 2005. “Physiological and behavioral reactivity to stress in thunderstorm-phobic dogs and their caregivers,” Applied Animal Behaviour Science 95:153–168.\nJ.S.J.

  "page_content": "Most humans know how paralyzing anxiety can be, especially these days. But it sometimes feels like the dog world is polarized between people who “get” anxious and nervous dogs and people who don’t. Worse, the humans who don’t understand dog anxiety can be dismissive and unkind, not to mention make it difficult for you to navigate the world with your pup by not respecting personal space.\nLately, however, people are coming to realize that completely calm, bombproof dogs are closer to the exception than the rule. Many dogs have something they’re not comfortable with, whether it’s alone time, storms, cats or children. This increased awareness has translated into easier tactics. First up, let’s go over typical behaviors of a dog with anxiety or nervousness.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nWhat Are Signs Of Dog Anxiety?\nKnowing the common signs a dog may exhibit can assist pet parents in figuring out what is causing the anxious or nervous reactions.\nExcessive barking and howling\nExcessive barking and howling\nExcessive whining\nExcessive whining\nAggression\nAggression\nPanting or drooling excessively\nPanting or drooling excessively\nDigging or scratching repetitively\nDigging or scratching repetitively\nDepression\nDepression\nExcessive licking\nExcessive licking\nPacing or restlessness\nPacing or restlessness\nCompulsive behaviors like unusual chewing\nCompulsive behaviors like unusual chewing\nUrinating or defecating in the house\nUrinating or defecating in the house\nTrembling or shaking\nTrembling or shaking\nWhen a dog becomes stressed and anxious, oftentimes this distress manifests in symptoms that mimic misbehavior. If your dog is experiencing some of the common symptoms of nervousness, you may be wondering what you can do to help.\nDoes your dog freak out when you head for the door? Here’s some advice.\nTips On How To Reduce Dog Anxiety\nHere are eight ways to make life with your anxious (or nervous) dog better for both of you.\nIn recent years, modern trainers have learned that an overwhelming majority of dogs who lunge at, bark at and fight with other dogs and humans aren’t doing so because they’re “dominant” or because they want to be “pack leader.” They’re doing it because they’re scared. A frightened dog, especially one who feels like they can’t escape, will turn to aggression to “get him before he gets me.” Once we know that aggression is rooted in fear, we know to avoid trainers who “rehabilitate” aggressive dogs bydominating them.\nHurting a dog with anxiety doesn’t stop them from being scared, it just makes them shut down. Change the emotion, on the other hand, and you’ll change the behavior. A dog who isn’t scared of other dogs has no need to bark or fight.Find a good dog trainer,ideally one who follows positive reinforcement principles and is certified by CCPDT, and you can work wonders together.\nThis might sound like the last thing you want to do with an anxious dog — I’ve certainly spent my share of time hiding around corners and not opening my door until I’ve checked that the coast is clear — but drawing attention to your dog’s anxiety is a good way to tell other people not to approach. Put a yellow ribbon on your dog’s leash, or buy a bandanna or harness that says “nervous” or “no dogs” and you’re giving people a heads-up without having to yell at them.\nIf your dog has anxiety about other dogs and is big enough that you could lose control if they lunge, consider a good quality muzzle. A muzzled dog is still seen by most people as a dangerous dog, which can lead to some unpleasantness for the owner, but thankfully, theMuzzle Up! Projectis trying to get rid of that prejudice and spread the word that a muzzle is a sign of a responsible owner and a safe dog. By making those with aggressive dogs feel safer, muzzles allow both people and dogs to get more enjoyment from being outside.\nDo these things to help your pup (and your guests) feel chill.\nWhile some vets are great with nervous and aggressive dogs, others are still very old school; they don’t listen to owners and use invasive and rough handling. There are, however, new techniques out there for vets dealing with anxious dogs.Dr. Sophia Yindeveloped a program for vets that focuses on low-stress handling, which can make a huge difference in your dog’s anxiety levels. AndDogs in Need of Spacehas a list of vets who go the extra mile for anxious dogs; if you do want to change your vet, it’s a good place to start.\nYour dog constantly communicates how they’re feeling, and the better you understand what they’re saying, the easier it can be to avoid stressful situations. Something that was fine for them last week might be too much for them to cope with today due to a phenomenon calledtrigger stacking(an increase in dog anxiety-related behaviors caused by them experiencing repeated stressful events without enough time in between for the associated stress hormones to leave the system). Avoid this by keeping an eye out for signs that tell you how your dog is feeling.\nYou might be thinking butwhat can I give my dog for anxiety? When I tell people, “My dog’s on Prozac,” most of them laugh; they think it’s a funny way of talking about dog anxiety. It’s not:she really is on Prozac. Many of the same antidepressant medications that millions of humans use have been proven to help dogs with anxiety have the confidence to try new behaviors.\nA conversation with your vet is the first step on this route. Your vet can refer you to a veterinary behaviorist, a DVM who is knowledgeable about both training and medication; a vet behaviorist can give you a complete prescription tailored to your dog’s needs and, ideally, liaise with your trainer or applied animal behaviorist (a professional who specializes in dogs with behavioral problems but is not a vet).\nMaking the decision to try medical intervention can seem like a big step, but there is a lot of specialist information designed to make it easier. A good place to start is Debbie Jacob’s website,fearfuldogs.com. There are also numerous over-the-counter pills and products marketed to help anxious dogs, but be careful if you choose to experiment with them. Most “calming supplements” haven’t been tested, and evidence for the ones that have been is sketchy at best. Ultimately, it’s a personal choice, but do remember that treatment has its own kind of placebo effect.\nHow to cope with dog anxiety—from training to medication.\nIt’s okay to be disappointed that your dog doesn’t want to go to thedog park, agility trials or pavement cafés. Try focusing on what you guys can do together instead. Set upindoor obstacle courses, go on quietwilderness hikes, take nose-work classes or just chill at home. Don’t try to force the dog you have to be the dog you wanted. In the end, you’re likely to make their problems worse, not to mention strain your relationship.\nIf you’re really out of your depth, or your dog represents a serious danger to you or your children, it’s okay to consider rehoming. Training and medications are expensive, and anxious dogs often require a lifetime commitment. In some cases, it’s safer for you and better for the dog to find a new home where they can get what they need if you don’t have the resources or the situation to provide it. You’re not a bad person or a failure — you’re making the wisest, kindest choice in the circumstances.",

  "page_content": "In recent years, there have been many much-needed cultural conversations about mental health. People have become more aware of their emotional needs and actively seek ways to manage stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health challenges — which is a great thing. But the question remains: What about our pets? Do they deal with similar concerns, and how can we help them if they do?\nSome pets live with anxiety or fear. Some have compulsive disorders, such as constant licking, pacing, or chasing imaginary objects. Others exhibit behaviors that may be perfectly normal for them (likebarking, scratching furniture, orchewing) but drive their humans up the wall. In all of these instances, behavioral therapy can help make the home a happier place for pets and their humans. To get the scoop on how a behavior treatment plan might help your pet, we talked to a board-certified veterinary behaviorist, Dr. Kat Pankratz.\nSave on the litter with color-changing tech that helps you better care for your cat.\nEasy ways to calm your pup’s nerves.\nTypes of Behavioral Support\nThe first thing to understand is that, much like humans, every pet is different. Their behaviors may appear common, but the severity and underlying causes vary. A skilled professional can assess your pet and provide tools and resources to address the challenges at hand. When choosing a professional, the options range from trainers to general practice veterinarians to veterinary specialists. All can provide helpful support, though their education, skillsets, and capabilities differ. Dr. Pankratz breaks down the distinctions.\n“A board-certified veterinary behaviorist (Diplomat of the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists or DACVB, orveterinary behaviorist) is a veterinarian who underwent additional years of training, board examination with certification, and continues to maintain current knowledge of the scientific understanding of all aspects of animal behavior,” explains Dr. Pankratz. “Veterinary behaviorists have the skills to assess the pet as a whole: physically and mentally. We can diagnose behavior conditions and formulate a comprehensive treatment plan.”\nHow to cope with dog anxiety—from training to medication.\n“A general practitioner veterinarian can also diagnose and create a treatment plan,” she continues. “The extent of their ability to diagnose and formulate a behavior treatment plan varies depending on the individual veterinarian’s comfort with behavioral medicine. Although their understanding of animal behavior may not have the depth or breadth of a DACVB, a general practitioner interested in behavior can be an important start.”\n“The general titlestrainerandbehavioristhave no restrictions for their use.Certified trainershave undergone some education or training to receive one of several certifications. Though there are exceptions, many trainers that focus on obedience training may not have sufficient skills to support the emotional change needed to treat behavioral problems. Trainers should not diagnose and cannot prescribe therapeutics that require a prescription. However, they can provide a helpful perspective to guide pet owners to seek veterinary support if they suspect the pet might benefit from a medical evaluation or possibly a therapeutic prescription.”\nA (seemingly) unstoppable nibbling obsession with all the blankets.\nManaging Nuisance Behaviors\nDigging holes in the backyard, clawing your couch cushions, andjumping up on house guestsare a few examples of behaviors that your pet probably loves (and for them come naturally) but that you could do without. The fact that these actions bum you out is reason enough to address them. But sometimes, these behaviors can also affect a pet’s quality of life.\n“Any behavior that reaches a point where it impacts a pet’s ability to eat, drink, rest, or engage in enjoyable activities could be a sign of something more pathologic,” Dr. Pankratz says. “In situations like that, seeking trusted professional advice would be recommended.”\nRegardless of whether it’s normal behavior or a pathologic condition, a trained professional can help. It may be a matter of changing up your pet’s environment or exercise routine to ensure their needs are being met. Or, your pet may have an underlying medical issue that requires diagnosis and treatment. In either instance, addressing the problems will make home life happier for you and your pet.\nKinship Collective dog trainer Robert Haussmann’s pro tips for getting a hyped-up dog to chill out.\nPotential Treatment Plans for Anxious, Fearful, or Aggressive Pets\nSome of the most challenging issues to address manifest as anxiety, aggression, or fear. We don’t always know what types of trauma or stress our pets have faced, but that doesn’t mean we can’t find ways to help. As noted earlier, a veterinary behaviorist has the most tools in the toolbox to address a pet’s physical and emotional needs. According to Dr. Pankratz, a veterinary behaviorist’s treatment plan may incorporate components of environmental management, behavior modification, and therapeutics.\nIn your own life, you probably go out of your way to avoid things that trigger you. Environmental management is all about helping your pet do the same.\n“This part of a treatment plan focuses on adjusting the environment for the pet to meet their physical and mental needs,” Dr. Pankratz says. “Modifying the environment aims to decrease exposure to stimuli that cause negative emotional states for the pet. Avoiding that stimuli helps maintain safety and prevents the pet from repeating unwanted behaviors. The goal is to set the pet up to success, so there is little opportunity to perform the unwanted behaviors, or be placed in a circumstance that might cause negative emotions.”\nThe toys that’ll help your pup chill out after a long day of being a dog.\nDo you ever take deep breaths when you need to calm down? Or ease into situations that you know you’ll find stressful? As humans, when we can’t avoid the things that bother us, we have to learn how to cope with them. It’s the same for pets, and behavior modification can help.\n“Behavior modification focuses on adjusting a pet’s emotional state,” Dr. Pankratz says. “The primary focuses include changing a pet’s emotional state from negative to positive and helping them develop coping skills to navigate difficult situations. This style of training is different from obedience training, as it focuses on empowering the pet to learn how to feel differently. This often starts in an environment that is very comfortable for the pet. When that pet has built sufficient foundational learning, we build on those skills thoughtfully and systematically in constructed learning opportunities that gradually build in difficulty based on that individual pet’s progress.”\nHow to teach your dog to enjoy, notdestroy, their toys.\nIs there a pill for that? Yes, sometimes there is.\n“Therapeutics vary from over-the-counter products to prescriptions,” Dr. Pankratz says. “The intent is to help dial down the intensity of negative emotions. Although sometimes the response can be incredible, therapeutics by themselves often do not eliminate the negative emotions altogether (thus the importance of the other two parts of the treatment plan). The goals of therapeutics are to decrease the negative emotions enough so the pet can better learn what is being taught instead of quickly escalating over-threshold, or to assist in a faster recovery after a triggering event. The goal of therapeutics should rarely be to sedate the pet or change their personality.”\nWhat You Can Do as a Pet Parent\nYou’ve already completed step one: research ways to help your pet through behavioral challenges.\nThe next best thing you can do is be a diligent observer and scribe. That means paying close attention to your pet’s behavior and what is going on around them when the behaviors occur. It’s also important to keep notes on recent changes in your pet’s life. Did you put them on a new medication? Get a new pet? Move to another home? Any information you can provide to the team of people supporting you will help them create the most effective treatment plan for your pet.",

    "title": "How to Road Trip With Your Dog",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-lifestyle/how-to-road-trip-with-your-dog"
  },
  "page_content": "Taking an extended road trip with your pup can be filled with lifelong memories and tons of social media content, but it’s a different animal than zipping out of town for a short weekend at a pet-friendly cabin. I should know: I took my Golden Retriever on a seven-month, multi-country, four-wheeled adventure a few years back. Let’s just say I learned some things!\nFirst, get real about whether they should come.\nThis is perhaps the most important decision you’ll make. While it can be loads of fun to share a long trip, it can also be overwhelming for you and your dog. Does your dog get car sick? Spending months on the road is probably not their idea of a good time. Maybe a few long-term rentals are a better option, giving you and your dog a home base with far less time in the car. Do they have aggression challenges with other people or animals? While it’s not impossible to manage behavior on the road, it becomes more difficult. Are they prone to anxiety where such a dramatic change in their routine is likely to cause extreme stress? You will never regret thinking through these things in advance.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nOK, they’re coming! Now, plan your set-up.\nWhile converted vans are the trendiest option for life on the road, there are a lot of ways to see the country and stay comfortable and safe with your dog. I opted for a truck camper and a large pickup truck with a backseat. When we were on the road, Keira had a fancy setup in the backseat so she could chill comfortably and safely. Once we were settled somewhere for the night, we spent our time in the camper, which came equipped with a small kitchen, toilet, bed, and dining table. I opted for a camper without an indoor shower so I’d have more storage for my dog’s things. Sixty square feet is a tight fit, but living minimally and spending most of our time outdoors made it workable.\nAll the essentials you need to hit the road with your co-pilot, from dog seatbelts to crash-tested carriers.\nResearch your route.\nIf your motivation for a road trip is to visit cities and their museums, shows, or other indoor activities, you’ll need to plan where your dog will stay when you do things like that. Maybe you have a friend or family member who can pet sit for a bit, but each time you leave your dog somewhere new, it’s an added stress. Some extroverted dogs are built for this — they can’t wait to meet new people and wouldn’t even notice you were gone for a few hours — but most dogs will feel at least mildly anxious over being with new people and most short-term rentals frown on leaving your dog alone. If youhave a breed of dog that is traditionally discriminated against, you’ll have an additional barrier as many short-term rentals and campgrounds still prohibit certain dogs.\nAn outdoor-centered trip is typically easier on everyone. In seven months, Keira and I visited over 30 national parks and forests in the U.S. and Canada and broke up the trip by visiting family and friends along the way. If you focus your trip around state and national parks, be sure to check regulations. Some parks, like the Badlands in South Dakota, don’t allow dogs on many of the trails, while others, like Death Valley, are famously too hot for dogs to enjoy.\nIn both parks, I made sure to arrive early to get a site with electricity (and therefore, air conditioning) and then made friends with our RV neighbors who offered to check in on Keira while I was hiking. Travelers are often missing their own pets and will jump at the opportunity to spend time with your dog. If the campsites were full or I couldn’t find anyone to keep an eye on her, I was prepared to keep driving until I found a safer place for us.\nWhere to go and what to do—from Alabama to Wyoming.\nPrep your dog.\nTalk with your veterinarian to ensure your dog is up to date on all appropriate vaccinations and plan to print out your dog’s records, including their rabies certificate, which will be required if you need to use a boarding facility or to enter another country. Depending on where you plan to travel, there may be a need to protect them from diseases that are rare in your hometown but more prevalent in the places you’re visiting.\nIf you need to cross the border into Canada or Mexico, be sure to check international rules, which may include a health certificate issued within a week or two of your arrival – a tricky requirement if you’re many miles away from your regular veterinarian. As for all the various pet gear you’ll need: Before the big trip, take a few test runs with your dog, perhaps driving to a nearby campground to practice setting up and to see if you forgot to pack any important supplies.\nFinally, have a backup plan.\nYou’ve planned your setup, your tentative route, and prepared your dog, but you won’t really know how your dog will take things till you’re on the road. Plan ahead by asking a family member or friend if they’d be willing to care for your pup in the event things aren’t going well and save some extra funds to help offset potential petsitting costs. Rethinking your route and allowing for longer stays in fewer places may also be a solution. When I first set out, I planned to spend a year on the road but by late fall, it was becoming increasingly uncomfortable to sleep in the truck camper, so I headed home, where Keira and I spent the last three months of our sabbatical napping, eating, and hiking while I prepared to re-enter the workforce.\nLiving on the road can be a life-changing experience. By putting together a solid game plan, you can ensure your days are filled with more tail wags and fewer barks.",

  "page_content": "Puppies acquired during lockdown have been missing out on critical socialization experiences and training, which is known to be associated with stress-induced behaviors ranging fromnervousness to fear-based aggression.\nPeople around the world have been spending more time at home since the start of 2020. For many of these people, this seemed like the perfect opportunity to get a pet. In the UK alone, an estimated3.2 million householdshave acquired a pet since the start of the pandemic. Dogs were the most popular new acquisition (57%), with cats a close second (38%). This sudden increase in pet ownership raises concerns about pet welfare.\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nIt isn’t just the pandemic pets that may be showing signs of stress or behavioral issues. Life hasn’t been normal for many dogs for most of the past few years. They’ve had less interaction with other dogs, fewer visitors coming into the home, and little time alone since the pandemic began.\nFewer interactions have caused more stress.\nThis has led to a noticeable change in dog behavior.Growling, snapping or nippingchildren when approached and handled by them increased by 57% during the lockdown. Google searches for “dog bark” and “dog bite” increased by 48% and 40%, respectively, suggesting some aspects of the lockdown period were particularly challenging for our pets.\nHey, man. It’s all about those chemical messengers. See how Adaptil can help your pup.\nAs humans, we tend to focus on situational stress — work deadlines, or paying bills. But stress can be caused by anything that upsets the body’s hormone balances. The presence of stressor results in a hormone cascade, culminating in the release of glucose that provides a burst of energy designed to help escape the stressor. This sets off the fight, flight or freeze response.\nStressors range from a physical threat, such as a predator, to an unpredictable environment, which our pets might be experiencing now lockdown restrictions ease. This isn’t limited to dogs. Changes to routine, particularly feeding schedule, have been shown to inducestress in cats, birds,sheepandhorses.\nIs your dog stressed?\nSigns of stress in your dog may be obvious, such as destructive behavior or vocalizing. But, there are also more subtle signs of stress in dogs, such as panting or drooling, pacing, repeatedly checking windows and doors, or chewing or scratching themselves.\nLockdown may, unfortunately, have a long-term impact on pets’ ability to cope when left home alone. Dogs that had separation anxiety before the restrictions started are likely to get worse when left again as owners head back to work. But we also expect to see new cases developing, because other dogs, and particularly puppies, have learned to expect company all day.\nResearch last yearshowed that 82% of pet parents surveyed noticed an increase in their dog whining or barking when a household member was busy. There was a 41% increase in reports of dogs being clingy or following people around the house during the lockdown. All of these can be indicators of separation anxiety developing.\nHow to help a stressed dog:\nThe good news is, it’s not too late to prepare your dog and to teach them vital skills that they can apply in any situation. If you’re starting to spend more time outside of the house, you need to remember that this change in routine is stressful for your pets. Start preventative measures now to avoid future problems.\nIf you have a dog who was previously used to being left alone, make sure you maintain their ability to cope with this by introducing periods of separation during the day when you are in the house – such as placing them behind a baby gate whilst you are working from home. Leave your dog at home for short periods of time.\nTrain your dog to stay calm when they’re on their own — instead of sad-singing“All By Myself”until you come home.\nBuild up the amount of time your dog is separated from family members gradually and associate it with something positive, such as a long-lasting treat. Monitor how your dog responds, and shorten the time left if they show any signs of anxiety.\nWhere dogs are already showing signs of separation anxiety (such as barking, howling, toileting, or being destructive when left), seek help from your vet in the first instance. Avoid looking for “quick fix” solutions like anti-bark collars or punishing your dog on return. These approaches will likely exacerbate the problem and result in more serious and more difficult-to-treat problems in the long run.\nTeaching dogs to be relaxed when left takes time and patience, particularly for the pandemic puppies that have rarely been away from their pet parents. But making the effort to show your dog that being alone is not stressful, using our advice, can prevent serious problems that are much more difficult to treat later in life.\nThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

    "title": "Big dogs, Small dogs: Does Size Affect Behavior?",
    "source": "https://www.kinship.com/dog-behavior/big-dog-vs-small-dog"
  },
  "page_content": "When it comes to dogs, size really does matter. While some preferpocket-sized pupsfor their portability, others like their dogs to be more on theXLside. Size-based biases are also common. And anyone with big dogs knows that people sometimes fear them even when their behavior is exemplary and a small dog is present whose behavior is not.\nOne of the marvels of domestic dogs is the astounding range of sizes they come in, which is determined by a very small number of genes. (In comparison, roughly 200generegions affect height in humans.) Since so few genes influence size, how does it affect behavior?\nTime to expose their identity… and find out which superhero theyreallyare.\nAre big dogs just compensating for something with their rowdy behavior? Do all small dogs have a superiority complex? Or are people’s behavior and expectations different based on the dog’s size? Here’s everything you need to know about dogs, big and small.\nLife with Big Dogs vs. Small Dogs\nA dog’s size has practical consequences. Here are a few examples:\nAsk anyone with a Great Dane suffering from diarrhea, an experience that’s not quite the same for someone with a similarly afflicted Maltese.\nDealing with a seven-pound Affenpinscher who prefers not to get into the car may require nothing more than a matter-of-factly picking them up and putting them inside. The situation is far more challenging when a 185-pound Saint Bernard is involved. Helping a large dog withmobility issuescan be physically demanding for the caregiver.\nBig dogs can be more expensive in every way, from the cost of food, professional grooming, and medication to toys, leashes, collars, and food bowls.\nWe crunched some numbers and yup, they’re worth every penny.\nPeople with little dogs who don’t want them to help themselves to food simply avoid picnicking on the floor and are careful not to leave chairs where they can be used as stepping stones to the table orcounter. People with large dogs often find that no place lower than the top of the refrigerator is safe or truly off-limits.\nWith a large dog, the accidental consumption ofdangerous foods, such as chocolate, is far less likely to lead to serious consequences than for a smaller dog because it takes much more for the dose to be toxic to a larger dog.\nGiving your pup a few treats? Those extra treats that lead toweight gainin smaller dogs may be no big deal for a large dog.\nSome worry about big dogs around children, but I must confess that I worry when we dog-sit a friend’s six-pound Pomeranian. Even gentle andrespectful kids can collide with small dogs and cause an injury completely by accident. With bigger dogs, that isn’t as much of a concern.\nIt’s easier to rent anapartmentwith a small dog (weight limits favor them); tight living spaces may be easier to share, and getting small dogs into and out of an apartment building, especially while you’rehousetrainingthem, is far less of a challenge.\nAre behavior differences determined by size?\nFor the most part, the answer is a resounding “No.” Behavioral differences in dogs are not size-based. Dogs of all sizes love to play chase, fetch, go on walks, run off-leash, meet new people, romp with their best dog buddies, participate in training sessions and eat tasty treats. By the same token, dogs of all sizes are vulnerable tosound sensitivity, exhibitseparation anxietyandaggression,jumpon people inappropriately,bark excessively, chew on shoes,dig in the garden, or have accidents on the floor. They all wag their tails (if they have them) in joy.\nAnd yet, there are clearly differences between individual dogs beyond age,gender, and the environment in which the dog lives and was raised. So, what gives? Turns out it’s a people problem.\nIt’s a big decision, so check these boxes before you sign on the dotted line.\nOnestudyexamined the connection between size and behavior in great detail, addressing these questions: How does a pet parent’s behavior toward dogs of unequal sizes influence their dogs’ behavior? How do expectations of dogs based on their size differ?\nThe study found that there are significant differences in behavior between large and small dogs and between pet parents of large and small dogs. Small dogs were reported to be less obedient, slightly more often aggressive or excitable, and moreanxiousandfearful. People with small dogs also reported a lower level of consistency in their interactions and enforcement of rules than did those with larger pups. Differences in people’s behavior may account for the higher rates of disobedience in small dogs.\nHave you ever noticed how some people treat their small dogs like they’re babies? Babyish features affect human caretaking behavior; we’re evolutionarily hardwired to find big eyes, small size, and proportionally large heads endearing. Psychologists call this the “Aww phenomenon.” If babies weren’t so cute, parents could be less likely to respond to their needs, and the offspring would be less likely to survive.\nThe evolutionary advantage of Kindchenschema for animals.\nDogs seem to elicit this same “aww” response in humans, especially small dogs, and even more so, breeds with pronounced juvenile features such as Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Chihuahuas, Japanese Chins, Pugs, and Boston Terriers. Since babies affect our hormones, raising the levels ofoxytocin— nicknamed “the love hormone” — it stands to reason that adorable dogs do, too.\nTypically, large dogs have moreopportunities for socializationthan small ones. When small dogs are carried around rather than moving around on their own four paws, they have fewer interactions with people and other dogs, which can limit their ability to cope with them.\nPositive experiences with other people and dogs duringpuppyhoodare the best way for a dog to develop good manners. But small dogs are often picked up or otherwise physically manipulated, which may result in more negative experiences. Absent enough of those positive experiences and dogs of all sizes will facesocial challenges.\nTwo research studies found that small dogs receive less formal training than large dogs. Also, people play fetch more often and do more tugging and nose work with big dogs than with small ones and are more likely to take them running or biking.\nThough many pet parents have the same rules for dogs of any size, what large and small dogs are allowed to get away with is often different. Small dogs aremore likelyto be allowed in our beds and on our laps. Having a 25-pound dog jump or sit on you is one thing, but having a 100-pound dog do it is another. Behaviors considered a nuisance in a small dog may be deemed antisocial in a large dog. Even aggression and other serious behavioral issues are more likely to be tolerated in small dogs.\nFor example, some pet parents encourage little dogs to jump up on people and get on the furniture but rarely invite big dogs to do so. Large dogs aremore likelyto be euthanized for aggression, though anotherstudyfound that the average “biter” tended to be a smaller dog. Part of that is about the perceived threat. While dogs of both sizes can be equally aggressive, the size factor may affect fear response.\nIn some ways, there are correlations between size and breed characteristics. Many small dogs are terriers and earth dogs, types that have been deliberately developed to be tenacious and curious as well as to dig and explore. If dogs are bred for those characteristics, such behavior will have far more to do with genetic influences on behavior than with size.\nOnestudyfound that small dogs were more likely than large dogs to come from pet stores, which generally acquire their “stock” frompuppy mills. When you consider that puppy mills are notorious for environmental deprivation and risky breeding practices, it is perhaps no surprise that small dogs are burdened with more problematic behavior.\nThe behavior of dogs is what makes them such great companions and friends. So, when it comes to pets, size really doesn’t matter. What does matter are the experiences you have together — the good, the bad, and the shoe-chewing ugly. It’s always big love, no matter what size the dog.\nA Survey of Dog Ownership in Suburban Australia — Conditions and Behavior Problem\nRisk factors for Separation-Related Distress and Feed-Related Aggression in Dogs: Additional Findings from a Survey of Australian Dog Owners",
